 ### Chapter 611: The World Is Like a Chess Game, Ever Changing

Along the ancient Tea Horse Road, a rider turned his horse slowly toward the veiled woman and the bookish scholar with the bamboo box.

Cao Fu wore a look of astonishment. "Uncle Sui, what’s Jingcheng doing?"

The old minister Sui Xinyu felt a surge of embarrassment on his aged face. Though he was boiling with anger inside, he struggled to keep his tone steady and smiled as he replied, "Jingcheng has never enjoyed going out. Perhaps she’s been startled by the disturbing sights today, causing her to become a bit disoriented. Cao Fu, turn back and comfort her."

Cao Fu nodded, smiling. "Don't worry, Uncle Fu. It’s perfectly normal for Jingcheng to be frightened."

Sui Wenfa was the most surprised of all. He murmured, "Although my aunt doesn’t venture out much, she’s never been like this before. With so many changes happening at home, my parents were panicking, yet Aunt was always the calmest. I’ve heard from Father that many difficult issues in the official circles were resolved by her wise counsel, always methodical and organized."

Cao Fu continued to communicate with the guardian spirit in his mind, "Can you see the depths of the situation?"

The swordsman Xiao Shuye hesitated for a moment before responding with his thoughts, "Don’t underestimate them; it’s best not to make enemies. Right now, the Great Zhuang Dynasty is rife with hidden currents. Didn’t we just leave the jurisdiction of our mountain gate? Who knows what sorts of scoundrels have crawled out of the depths, like if the other party happens to be a celestial master from the Golden Scale Palace, it could entangle your master and the palace in an endless mess."

Cao Fu said, "Unless he tries to forcibly take Sui Jingcheng from us, we should be fine."

Xiao Shuye nodded. "That’s for the best. From the looks of that man, he doesn’t seem like someone who meddles in affairs down the mountain; otherwise, he wouldn’t have left the pavilion by himself earlier."

Cao Fu forced a smile. "I just fear that we’re the mantis stalking the cicada, unaware that the oriole is behind us, and this fellow is the slingshot aiming for us from the start."

Xiao Shuye chuckled. "If that’s the case, then we’ll just have to fight it out. Sui Jingcheng is a person your master has set his sights on; she carries a great opportunity. Since she discovered the signs before us, there’s no need to hesitate. On the path of enlightenment, if you miss an opportunity, you may never grasp it again in this lifetime. Ultimately, the master is still looking out for you, and you and Sui Jingcheng are already intertwined. You were the first to notice the value of that magical robe on her. This grand opportunity should belong to you."

Xiao Shuye glanced at the concealed blue-clad scholar. "If he’s merely a pure martial artist, as long as he’s not in front of Wang Dun and me, the eight direct disciples are all fair game. But if he’s a practitioner, not one of those highly ambitious Golden Scale Palace cultivators, then it’s manageable. When I reminded you to be cautious earlier, it was really to prevent unexpected situations. There’s no need to be overly afraid; most of today’s experts have gone to the Great Zhuang Capital."

Cao Fu nodded. "Let’s take it one step at a time. Once we confirm his identity, we shouldn’t be in a hurry to eliminate him. Sui Jingcheng seems to have developed some suspicion toward us. How strange, how did she see through it?"

Xiao Shuye laughed. "Your bride-to-be is already half a cultivator. Her temperament and intuition are beyond what ordinary people have. Our plans were too shallow and coincidental, inevitably causing her to be suspicious. Of course, it’s also possible she’s pretending to test you; you must be patient and keep your thoughts to yourself. A woman like that, meticulous and willing to put her pride on the line for a gamble, is truly a natural-born cultivator. You two are indeed a good match. Once you become celestial partners, she will undoubtedly be a great asset to you and the mountain gate. Let me add one more thing: the master only desires the magical robe and golden hairpin on her; the person should still belong to you."

Cao Fu said helplessly, "My master has treated me better than he would a biological son; I understand."

Xiao Shuye chuckled, choosing not to elaborate further, as it would hurt feelings. Why does the master treat you so well? You, Cao Fu, shouldn’t take advantage of it and act coy. After all, your master is a Golden Core female cultivator. Had your cultivation not been so low, had you not yet stepped into the Insightful Sea realm, far from the Dragon Gate realm, you two would have long since become partners on the mountain. So, if Sui Jingcheng is really to become your woman, there will be consequences once you reach the mountain. Perhaps after obtaining the bamboo robe and the three golden hairpins, you’ll have to personally craft a pair of powder-white skulls.

Xiao Shuye believed that when that day comes, Cao Fu would decisively make the right choice without hesitation.

The path of enlightenment is indifferent. On the road to longevity, aside from the celestial partners bound by the covenant of enlightenment, women are like shoes, whose beauty can be exchanged or discarded at any moment.

A horse trotted slowly forward, seemingly fearful of startling the woman who had just adjusted her veil.

She stood up and once again positioned herself behind the young blue-clad guest, whispering, "Young Master Chen, I know you are a genuine celestial being from the mountain and bear no ill will toward me or the Sui family. It’s just that I was disappointed earlier and didn’t want to bother with it. But Cao Fu is a scheming man; he deliberately set a trap for me. As long as you save me today, I will serve you like a maid, doing everything from serving tea to carrying boxes!" 

The young man, already turned to face the others, lightly shook his folding fan and said, "Stop talking nonsense. Heroes in the martial world act for righteousness, not seeking rewards. Spare me the pleasantries of pledging to be your servant and such. Be careful not to end up overreaching. By the way, do you think that Hu Xinfeng, the great hero, deserves to die?"

The veiled woman pondered carefully, choosing her words with care. Perhaps she thought this young celestial master was testing her wits. She cautiously replied, "He was simply cowardly and never killed anyone; his crimes do not warrant death."

The young man smiled and nodded. "This is what you said; you won’t go back on it, right?"

She nodded heavily.

He closed his folding fan and lightly tapped his shoulder, leaning slightly back, then turned with a smile. "Hu the Great, you may disappear now."

Hu Xinfeng, panicking, leaped away, directly vanishing down the Tea Horse Road, displaying a spirit of bravery as he dashed away, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

The two sides were merely ten steps apart when Sui Xinyu sighed, "Silly girl, stop messing around and come back! Isn’t Cao Fu already infatuated with you? Don’t you realize that what you’re doing is foolish and ungrateful?!"

As he spoke, the old minister, renowned for his strategic prowess in the kingdom, was filled with rage. He sternly said, "The Sui family has upheld a strong moral tradition for generations; how can you act like this! Even if you’re unwilling to hastily marry Cao Fu, and are struggling to accept this unexpected match, your father, who came back with a heavy heart for you, is also a reasonable person. Do you have to act so recklessly, making your father feel ashamed? Are you trying to bring disgrace to the Sui family?!"

Young Sui Wenfa and young Sui Xinyi both turned pale with fear.

They had never seen their grandfather so furious.

The veiled woman smiled bitterly. "Father, I only know one thing: practitioners are the most indifferent. Mundane ties are best avoided."

Cao Fu’s gaze softened as he gently said, "Miss Sui, once you become a genuine cultivator on the mountain, you’ll understand that there is also the notion of celestial partners up there. To meet and connect with someone on the mountain after first meeting down here is truly rare. How could I not cherish that? My master is a Golden Core earth immortal, a true practitioner at the mountain peak. He has been in seclusion for many years, but upon his emergence, he read my fortune and calculated the movements of the Red Luan Star. He even specially inquired about the birth dates of us both, and after his calculations, he found only this prophetic saying: 'A match made in heaven, hard to find in a hundred years.'"

The veiled woman hesitated for a moment, saying she needed to wait a while. She took a handful of copper coins from her sleeve, clenched them in her right palm, then raised her arm high, gently tossing them into her left palm. 

She inspected the coins, raising her head at last, tightly gripping the copper coins, and said with a bitter smile, "Cao Fu, do you know why I styled my hair like a widow after my first marriage failed? It’s like I was mourning. Later, even when my father and your family discussed a marriage alliance, I still didn’t change my hairstyle, because I relied on this method to predict that the one who died prematurely—the scholar—was my true match in this life. You, Cao Fu, were not. You were not then, and you are not now. Had your family not suffered a calamity back then, I would have followed family wishes and married you. After all, it’s hard to go against a father’s command. But after that one time, I vowed never to marry again in this life. So even if my father pushes me to marry you, even if I misunderstood you, I still swear I will never marry!"

She threw the copper coins fiercely to the ground and suddenly pulled out a golden hairpin from her sleeve, instantly piercing it through the thin veil over her neck, blood seeping out as she looked toward the elder on horseback, sobbing, "Father, please let me be willful just once?"

Sui Xinyu pounded his fist on his leg, gritting his teeth, "This is rebellion, pure rebellion! How did I raise such a bewitched child! What celestial dream delivery, what prophecies from high experts…"

Sui Xinyu was so furious he became incoherent.

Cao Fu smiled bitterly. "Uncle Sui, why don’t we just let it go? I don’t want to see Jingcheng in such distress."

The blue-clad scholar pressed his bamboo fan against his forehead, looking pained. "What are you all making such a fuss about? A girl intent on self-destruction, an old man pressing for marriage, a kind-hearted celestial master, a young boy bewildered about wanting to acknowledge his uncle, and a girl just starting to awaken love, tangled up with a martial arts master contemplating whether to strike. What do I have to do with this? The fighting over there has already ended; why not return home and close the door to discuss your family matters?"

A horse trotted slowly past the two, who had been standing side by side, asking, "In the Kingdom of Qingci, Xiao Shuye, may I ask which sect you belong to?"

The man across casually raised his hand, causing the scattered copper coins on the road to hover in mid-air, smiling as he said, "A servant of the Golden Scale Palace, a mere Golden Core sword cultivator. Coincidentally, I just exited seclusion not long ago. Seeing how you two seem displeased, I thought I’d learn from you and attempt a heroic rescue."

Then he turned and mockingly smiled at the veiled woman. "Do you think tossing coins for divination is reliable? Are you fooling ghosts?"

She remained unmoved, only pressing the golden hairpin against her neck.

Cao Fu communicated through his mind, "I’ve heard my master mention that the chief servant of the Golden Scale Palace is indeed a Golden Core sword cultivator, with immense killing power!"

Xiao Shuye, now one of the top ten swordsmen, lightly nodded and replied mentally, "This is a serious matter. The magical robe and golden hairpin on Sui Jingcheng, especially that secret incantation, could be closely tied to the master’s path of enlightenment. We cannot afford to retreat; I will take action to test that person. If he is indeed the Golden Scale Palace’s Golden Core sword cultivator, you must immediately escape, and I will help buy you time. If he’s a fake, then there’s no issue."

The man twisted his wrist, causing the fan to flutter, and the copper coins began to dance and rise. He clicked his tongue and said, "This swordsman brother carries a heavy killing intent. I wonder how many pounds of sword energy you have. Is it faster than my life’s flying sword, or is the sword of the mountain swifter?"

A ray of rainbow light shot out from the young scholar’s brow.

The miniature flying sword of the sword immortal appeared, and the moment it did, Xiao Shuye leaped back, grabbing Cao Fu’s shoulder and lifting off the ground, landing on a tree branch as he dashed away.

However, the blue-clad figure was already standing atop the branch Xiao Shuye had just leapt from. "If given the chance, I will visit you, Xiao Shuye, and Master Cao in the Kingdom of Qingci."

As he spoke, Xiao Shuye tossed out a golden talisman.

But it was pierced by a beam of sword light, spinning back into the young sword immortal’s hand, where it was crushed in his palm.

Xiao Shuye’s retreat was even faster.

Indeed, it was the Golden Core sword cultivator from the Golden Scale Palace!

The blue-clad scholar stepped back, floating back down to the Tea Horse Road, holding his folding fan, smiling as he said, "Generally speaking, you should be grateful and thank the great hero, after which he would say 'no need,' and leave gracefully. In fact… that’s precisely the case."

He casually grasped the green hiking staff that he had previously stuck into the ground, and it flew back into his hand. Seemingly recalling something, he pointed at the elder seated on horseback, saying, "You scholars, whether good or bad, whether clever or foolish, are truly hard to please. No wonder you have befriended a hero like Hu the Great. I advise you not to scold him; I ponder that this friendship between old and young is not for naught, and neither should blame anyone."

He pointed at the young boy. "No matter how good your character is, in such a family, you’ll probably just end up being another old minister who’s good at playing chess but not at being human."

Then he pointed at the young girl. "Jealousy towards those close to you is unwarranted."

Finally, he turned to the veiled woman and smiled, "Actually, before you stopped your horse and pulled me into the water, I had a decent impression of you. Among this family, you seem the most like… a clever good person. Of course, self-preservation in life is natural. Betting it all is also human nature; in any case, you have nothing to lose. If you win, you escape calamity, successfully dodging the traps of those two. If you lose, you merely wrong the devoted Cao Daoren. For you, there’s no loss. So I’d say your luck with gambling… is quite good."

The blue-clad scholar finally asked, "Have you ever considered the possibility that we all lose? I might die. Earlier, at the pavilion, I was just an ordinary teacher, but I never implicated your family, didn’t deliberately attach myself to you, nor asked you for those dozens of silver coins. Good things didn’t become better, and bad things didn’t worsen. Right? What was your name again? Sui something? Deep down, you must ask yourself—if you became a celestial practitioner like Cao Fu, would you truly be better than him? I think not."

With a single step, he seemed to walk out over ten feet, and in an instant, he vanished from sight.

The copper coins had already fallen to the ground.

The veiled woman put away the golden hairpin, crouching down to pick up the copper coins one by one.

She tucked the coins into her sleeve, still not standing up, and finally, slowly raised her arm, her palm brushing through the thin veil as she wiped her eyes, softly choked up, "This is the true cultivator. I knew it; he’s just like the sword immortals I imagined. I’ve missed this grand opportunity on the path of enlightenment..."

At the foot of the mountain.

Hu Xinfeng hid near a rocky cliff, trembling in fear.

It wasn't that he didn’t want to run further, but there were no more places to hide outside this mountain. Hu Xinfeng was afraid that if he ran, he might catch someone’s eye and suffer an unwarranted disaster.

Suddenly, before his eyes dazzled, Hu Xinfeng’s knees went weak, almost kneeling on the ground. He reached out to support himself on the rock face, trembling as he said, "Hu Xinfeng greets the immortal teacher."

The blue-clad young scholar smiled. "What a coincidence; we meet again. One leg, one punch, and one stone, just right three times. So, Hu the Great, do you want to take me as your disciple?"

Hu Xinfeng sighed, "You can kill or butcher me, immortal teacher; it’s your word!"

The young scholar looked at him with admiration. "What a strong will this great hero has!"

He lightly patted Hu Xinfeng’s shoulder, laughing, "I’m just a bit curious. Earlier, at the pavilion, what did you and Yang Yuan talk about? Your human chess game may not seem remarkable, but it’s better than nothing; consider it helping me pass the time."

Hu Xinfeng's shoulder tilted painfully, the agony piercing to the bone. He dared not scream, biting his lip to suppress his cries, feeling as if all the bones in his shoulder had shattered. Moreover, he involuntarily knelt down, while the young man merely leaned slightly and kept his palm gently on Hu Xinfeng’s shoulder. In the end, Hu Xinfeng was kneeling on the ground, and the young man just bent down, looking at this unfortunate hero with a smile.

The young man released his grip, set the book box against the cliff, picked up a wine jug, and took a sip. He pressed it down in front of him, not knowing what he was pressing, but to Hu Xinfeng’s cold-sweat-drenched eyes, it radiated a chilling and bizarre mystery. The scholar smiled and said, "Finding a reason to keep living for you is actually a simple matter. Under the pressure of the situation at the pavilion, you had to weigh the situation, kill that deserving old brother Sui, leaving behind the two women favored by the other side, so you could submit your name to that Hu the Great, ensuring your survival. Then, suddenly, a long-lost son-in-law appeared, causing you to lose an old minister’s affection and turn into enemies. The relationship became irreparable. So when you saw me, a mere bookish scholar, I could walk around unharmed, rousing your ire because I accidentally miscalculated my strength, hitting you a little too hard and a little too often, right?"

Hu Xinfeng knelt on the ground, shaking his head. "It’s my fault."

The young man stepped on Hu Xinfeng’s foot, crushing the bones. Hu Xinfeng gritted his teeth in silence.

Then the young man kicked Hu Xinfeng on the forehead, forcing his head against the rock face.

The scholar leaned forward, resting his elbow on his knee, and asked with a smile, "Knowing that you should die is good; it saves me the trouble of finding a reason."

Hu Xinfeng’s face turned pale, trembling as he said, "I ask one thing; you can kill me, but please don’t involve my family!"

The scholar squinted at Hu Xinfeng, who desperately pleaded, "I beg you to agree to this!"

Then Hu Xinfeng saw the young scholar smile, "I accept this reason. Get up; at least you still have some backbone. Don’t make it a habit to kneel for too long. Once a person kneels for too long, it becomes second nature."

Hu Xinfeng swayed, standing up, and couldn’t help but wipe his tears.

It was entirely genuine; it wasn’t a pretense of pity.

In that earlier moment, he genuinely thought he would die, and he thought of the many people at home, facing the possibility of a disaster from a celestial fire that might wipe them all out overnight. 

The young man took a sip of wine. "Now, tell me, what did you discuss with Yang Yuan earlier?"

Leaning against the rocky cliff, Hu Xinfeng endured the pain in his head, shoulder, and foot, and with a hard head, he dared not hide anything, saying through gritted teeth, "I told Yang Yuan that I am familiar with all matters inside and outside the Sui residence and that he could ask me later. Yang Yuan agreed, saying it was clever of me."

Chen Pingan nodded, taking a sip of wine. "In every moment, you all seem to make the right choices."

Then Hu Xinfeng heard this unfathomable young man change his tone, smiling as he said, "Except for me."

The blue-clad scholar glanced at the scenery in the distance and casually asked, "Have you heard of the Golden Scale Palace in the deep mountains at the border of the Great Zhuang?"

Hu Xinfeng nodded. "I once heard Senior Wang Dun mention that immortal residence at a very small banquet, where I could only sit at the lowest seat. But I listened closely; when Senior Wang Dun mentioned the Golden Scale Palace, he spoke with great respect, saying the palace master is a celestial being of very high realm. In the Great Zhuang Dynasty, perhaps only that national protector and the female martial god could match him."

The scholar scoffed. "A pure martial artist below the ninth realm dares to call himself a female martial god?"

Hu Xinfeng wiped the sweat from his forehead, his expression awkward. "It’s just our way of showing respect for that female master; she has never claimed that title herself."

The blue-clad scholar took another sip of wine, saying, "If you have any healing pills or spiritual medicines, hurry and apply them before you bleed to death. I don’t have the bad habit of collecting corpses."

Hu Xinfeng finally felt a sense of relief and quickly crouched down, pulling out a porcelain bottle to apply the medicine to his wounds.

Suddenly, the young man asked, "How much is this bottle of medicine worth?"

Hu Xinfeng quickly raised his head, smiling bitterly. "This is a rare and expensive secret medicine from the Five Ridge Kingdom’s Immortal Herb Manor. Even someone like me, who has his own sect and has made some money, felt pained buying three bottles back then. But thanks to my relationship with Senior Wang Dun, they were willing to sell me three bottles."

The young man said, "Making money and wandering the martial world is not easy."

At this point, Hu Xinfeng felt like he was in a state of alarm, thinking to himself that the "Wandering Herbs Gathering" was indeed an ominous saying. He vowed never to set foot in the Great Zhuang Dynasty again; to hell with the "Wandering Herbs Gathering."

The young man suddenly looked down, smiling as he asked, "Do you think the title of a Golden Scale Palace Golden Core sword cultivator would scare off Cao Fu and Xiao Shuye?"

Hu Xinfeng hesitated before nodding. "That should be sufficient."

He plopped down onto the ground, contemplating, "But perhaps not?"

The blue-clad scholar even took out a chessboard and chess pieces from his book box, sitting down with a smile. "Then what do you think? Should the Sui Xinyu family of four die?"

Hu Xinfeng shook his head, smiling bitterly. "What’s there to deserve death? Sui Xinyu has always had a good reputation and is a good person. He just values his reputation too highly, keeping himself clean, preferring to play it safe in the official circles. He’s not very pragmatic, but isn’t that how scholars behave when they become officials? Those like Sui Xinyu, who don’t disturb or harm the people, have already done some good deeds in the Five Ridge Kingdom. Of course, I deliberately befriended the Sui family for my own reputation in the martial world, hoping to get to know this old minister. There aren’t many like him in the Five Ridge Kingdom’s martial scenes. Certainly, Sui Xinyu also hoped I could introduce him to Senior Wang Dun, but I had no ability to do so and kept finding excuses to decline. After a few times, Sui Xinyu stopped bringing it up, knowing my difficulties. At first, he was just raising his status, boasting, which shows Sui Xinyu is a good person."

The blue-clad scholar remained noncommittal, lifting a hand, aligning his fingers, and conjuring a legendary flying sword.

Hu Xinfeng swallowed hard.

Could it be that the chief servant of the Golden Scale Palace was indeed a genuine sword immortal who looked young but had lived for hundreds of years?

Yet the scholar merely pinched a chess piece in one hand while delicately carving with that flying sword. It seemed he was writing a name. After finishing, he gently placed it on the chessboard.

Hu Xinfeng reflected that this immortal, whom he first encountered at the pavilion, was indeed playing a game, and later when Sui Xinyu engaged him in conversation, this immortal had not returned the thirty or so pieces on the board but had kept them close, probably for the same reason—perhaps some pieces were marked with names? He worried that Sui Xinyu, skilled in chess, might notice those subtle clues while contemplating.

The young man resumed carving the chess pieces, asking, "If I didn’t hear wrongly, you are the leader of the Crossing Gang in the Five Ridge Kingdom?"

Hu Xinfeng smiled bitterly. "You’re making fun of me."

The young man flipped the chess piece he had engraved, adding the words 'Crossing Gang' before placing it on the board.

Afterward, he quickly engraved more than ten pieces, placing them on the board one after another.

That beam of sword light flickered away from his brow.

Then Hu Xinfeng noticed that this genuine sword immortal began to stare blankly.

Earlier, at the pavilion, he was clearly someone Hu Xinfeng could easily beat.

But at this moment, Hu Xinfeng felt that this person, who was "playing a game" alone, was inscrutable and unfathomable.

Chen Pingan lay the hiking staff across his knees, gently stroking it.

In that previous chess game at the towering peak, every player, every situation, was like pieces rooted in perilous places, each containing dangers yet brimming with spirit.

Even without the appearance of the big sword immortal Ji Yue, who howled from the mountains, or casually killing a Golden Core sword cultivator from the Golden Scale Palace, it had still been a splendid game.

It was just that this game was one Chen Pingan could not enter, making it difficult to delve into the intricacies of each line. Otherwise, the sect leader Lin Shu, that former prince, and the two spies inserted within the Zhenrong Sect by the Golden Scale Palace, among others, were all exquisite pieces that had naturally emerged on the board, truly coming to life through their own skills and abilities, no longer mere lifeless pieces.

As for today’s game at the pavilion, it was fraught with tension and discomfort, human sentiments fluctuated, good and evil transformed without surprise, making it impossible to analyze; it was neither good nor bad, neither good nor truly bad.

Old minister Sui Xinyu, a villain? Certainly not. He was eloquent and skilled at chess.

But he merely kept to himself, adept at avoiding calamity. Even Hu Xinfeng felt that this old minister should not die; of course, Hu Xinfeng was unaware that his answer, combined with his desperate plea just before dying, saved him twice. It was a compensation for the two previous "tests" of fists and stones.

However, there was still one more time; if he answered incorrectly, Hu Xinfeng would still die.

This Hu Xinfeng was indeed an old hand in the martial world; before the pavilion, he was willing to escort Sui Xinyu, embarking on the distant journey to the Great Zhuang Capital. As long as life was not at stake, he remained the famous Hu the Great in the martial world.

Du Yu from the Ghost Axe Palace said it well: without seeing life and death, one cannot witness a hero. But if one dies, it seems to be just that.

The turmoil at the pavilion involved the muddled Sui Xinyu, Yang Yuan who helped stage the act, and Cao Fu, who was the most calculative. Among the three, it could be said that none bore a reputation as infamous as Yang Yuan, yet Yang Yuan had unexpectedly spared a bookish scholar who could have been crushed with a finger, even thinking that "Chen Pingan" had some spirit and was even more admirable than the retired official respected in the court, the literary world, and among chess masters.

Hu Xinfeng sat across from this extraordinary being, his injuries merely bleeding but the pain was genuine.

The young man, not looking up, casually asked, "In the martial world, if a hero kills the chief villain yet leaves behind the accomplices, it’s a crime not worthy of death. The hero punishes them, then leaves gracefully, and the person saved thanks the hero with a bow. Would you say that hero is graceful?"

Hu Xinfeng blurted out, "Graceful my foot…"

Realizing what he had said, Hu Xinfeng slapped himself and quickly corrected, "To report back to the immortal teacher, that wouldn’t count as true grace. If it’s a hero within the same country or county helping the locals, that would be one thing. If the villains die and others are merely injured, having suffered some hardship, they probably won’t harbor ill thoughts against the saved person. But if this hero is merely passing through somewhere, if he were to leave just like that, for a year or a half, that’s fine, but for three to five years, who can guarantee the saved person won’t end up in a worse situation? Perhaps they were just being robbed of their daughters, and in the end, their whole family would be killed. So, when it comes to this tragedy, who should be blamed? Is that hero guilty? I would say yes."

The young man nodded, "Then if you were that hero, what would you do?"

Hu Xinfeng slowly said, "Do good to the end; don’t be in a hurry to leave. Try to wear down the remaining villains who are not dead with some patience. Don’t flaunt any heroism; the villains still need to be dealt with. Otherwise, they really won’t learn their lesson. They should be made to fear to the bone, and it’s best if they wake up from nightmares every night, as if that hero would appear before them each day. Perhaps then, that would truly save the person they rescued."

The young man raised his head, smiling, "You speak fluently, without any hesitation; you have done this sort of thing before, haven’t you? More than once?"

Hu Xinfeng couldn’t bear the pain any longer, wiping the sweat from his forehead, quickly nodding. "I did some similar things when I was younger, but after I married and had my own family, I didn’t do that much anymore. Firstly, I couldn’t manage so many troublesome matters, and secondly, it’s easier to get into trouble. The martial world can’t say it’s dangerous everywhere, but the water is indeed murky. No one dares to claim that everything always goes as they wish. There are not only good people who’ve been wronged or have deep-seated grudges; the descendants and friends of bad people and villains can also have the same kind of patience."

The young man nodded. "You are indeed a seasoned person in the martial world. In the future, when facing great gains and losses, and your mind is troubled, you should still suppress any evil thoughts… malicious intentions. It doesn’t matter what you do out of anger; ultimately, as you said, the martial world is deep and murky, so caution is key. You are already a martial hero who has achieved a considerable legacy; don’t let it all go to waste, dragging your family down. It’s best not to find yourself entangled in the difficult intersection of good and evil; it’s not beneficial to you or anyone else."

Hu Xinfeng felt utterly bewildered.

Why did he feel like he was about to die again?

Were these words a death sentence?

The young man laughed and waved his hand, "Aren’t you going yet? Why, do you want to stay here and chat with me? Or do you think I’m a terrible chess player, and since you can’t win with your fists, you want to challenge me on the chessboard?"

Hu Xinfeng bitterly said, "Chen the Immortal, I really will leave now!"

The young man raised his head, looking at him strangely, "What’s this? Do I have to ask you to leave for you to go?"

Hu Xinfeng had no courage to refuse, struggling to stand up and hobbling away.

At this moment, he was no longer afraid of the pain.

In the mirror of self-reflection, he saw Chen Pingan everywhere.

Chen Pingan smiled and continued to gaze at the chessboard, the pieces all representing Hu Xinfeng and these strangers.

Finding it meaningless, he waved his sleeve to collect them, black and white mixed, casually storing them in the chess jar, then shaking his sleeve to scatter the pieces he had placed on the chessboard earlier onto it.

He stared at each chess piece.

One hand propping up his chin, the other shaking the fan.

The game played at the small town on the towering peak, setting aside the heights of realms and intricacies, bore certain similarities to his hometown in some aspects.

After a long silence, he packed the pieces and chess tools back into the bamboo box, putting away the hiking staff and bamboo box, fastening the folding fan, and securing the now empty sword-raising gourd.

Chen Pingan reapplied a talisman to himself, beginning to hide and stealthily move forward.

There was something that needed verification.

There was a saying he had forgotten to mention earlier.

But whether he said it or not, it didn’t really matter. Many people in this world, when they transform from someone who’s laughed at into a joke in others’ eyes, when facing hardship, will only blame others and resent the world, never reflecting on themselves.

Over time, some of these people, through gritted teeth, manage to hold on, and see the clouds part to reveal the moon. Others suffer without realizing it, inflicting suffering on others, feeling all the more exhilarated, calling themselves strong. Parents teach nothing, and even immortals can hardly change them.

On the Tea Horse Road leading to the foot of the mountain, the four members of the Sui family descended silently, each lost in their thoughts.

It was still the clear youth who couldn’t help but be the first to speak up. "Aunt, that Cao Fu is a malicious person. The Hu the Great and Yang Yuan were deliberately sent by him to stage a performance for us, right?"

The veiled woman coldly laughed. "Ask your grandfather; his chess skills are unparalleled, his knowledge vast, and he can read people accurately."

The elder snorted.

The young girl appeared even more dazed, swaying dangerously as if about to fall off her horse several times.

Sui Xinyu, having been a minister, spoke to the young boy and girl, "Wenfa, Wenyi, you go ahead a little. Your aunt and I need to discuss some matters."

The boy called out several absent-minded times to his sister, and the two spurred their horses slightly faster, moving ahead, yet not daring to ride too far away, staying about twenty steps ahead of the two riders behind.

The elder slowed his horse, riding alongside his daughter, anxiously furrowing his brows, "Cao Fu is now a cultivator on the mountain, and that elder is a top-tier expert compared to Hu Xinfeng. Who knows what will happen next? Jingcheng, I know you resent me for being short-sighted, not recognizing Cao Fu’s sinister intentions. But how we navigate this predicament for the Sui family is the real issue."

The veiled woman spoke in a detached tone, "For now, Cao Fu doesn’t dare to trouble us. But the journey home is nearly a thousand miles. Unless that Chen the Sword Immortal appears again, we’re unlikely to survive the trip back home; we may not even reach the capital."

The elder grew angry. "This scoundrel deliberately hiding his true self! It would have been one thing to feign incompetence at the pavilion, but why act so ambiguously after revealing his identity? If he’s truly that sword immortal from strange tales, why not just kill Cao Fu and the others? Now he’s letting a tiger return to the mountain, leaving potential troubles for the future?!"

Sui Jingcheng seemed to feel a swell of frustration and simply removed her veil, revealing her stunning face, gazing ahead as if she were an outsider in this game. Mimicking the words and tone of the old minister, she smiled and said, "At the pavilion, we chose not to save him, and even if he helped us once now, to turn around and blame him for not doing enough good is hardly the conduct of a proper descendant of the Sui family."

The elder nearly raised his whip to strike her. How can this ungrateful daughter be so brazen?

He lowered his voice, "The urgency now is to figure out how we can escape this unwarranted disaster!"

At that point, the elder’s anger made his teeth itch. "Look at you! How can you still have the face to say anything about your father? If it weren’t for you, would our Sui family have faced this calamity? How dare you speak like this to your father?!"

The veiled woman surprisingly nodded, "Father, you’re right. What you say makes a lot of sense."

The elder could no longer contain himself and lashed out at his ungrateful daughter.

The young boy and girl ahead quickly turned their heads at this scene, with the young girl covering her mouth, silently crying, while the boy felt the ground shake beneath him, unsure of what to do.

Sui Jingcheng remained indifferent, only frowning. "If I have some minor magical skills, if you injure me, it might turn a life-threatening situation into a deadlock with no way out. Father, you’ve been a dominant figure in the chess world for decades; surely you understand this basic chess principle?"

The elder raised his hand once more, almost ready to strike her again, but he hesitated for a long while, feeling disheartened, his arm dropping. "Forget it; we might as well wait for death."

The woman fell silent for a moment, surveying her surroundings, then softly said, "Suppose the worst outcome occurs: what if Cao Fu and the others remain unwilling to give up, following us closely? The only chance for the four of us to survive is to gamble on the best possible outcome—that the sword immortal surnamed Chen is traveling with us toward the Five Ridge capital. Earlier, observing his route, there’s a possibility of that. But don’t be too happy, father; I feel that as long as Cao Fu and the others don’t see that sword immortal, they’ll be careful in dealing with us. The sword immortal surnamed Chen will not care about our lives. It’s inevitable, in this matter, you are at fault, and so am I."

She self-deprecatingly said, "Truly deserving to be father and daughter, and with the obedient niece in front, it’s no surprise we’re all of a kind."

The elder furrowed his brow, "Enough with your sarcasm! In the end, aren’t we just making things harder for ourselves!"

Sui Jingcheng sighed, "Then we need to find an opportunity to pretend that the sword immortal surnamed Chen is secretly tailing us, just enough for Cao Fu and the others to see, causing them to hesitate and not dare to gamble with our lives."

The elder’s face showed a hint of amusement. "This plan is quite clever, Jingcheng. Let’s strategize carefully to ensure everything is seamless and natural."

But the young woman’s expression darkened. "However, even if we can deceive Cao Fu, it will be easy for them to unravel this scheme. I can already anticipate it, and I believe Cao Fu will figure it out sooner or later."

The elder’s heart sank, puzzled. "What do you mean?"

She smiled bitterly. "Let that Hu the Great Yang Yuan come back to kill us again, and that’s it."

The elder’s face turned sorrowful. "My life is at an end!"

Tears streamed down her face suddenly as she adjusted her veil, turning to say, "Father, you’re right; a thousand mistakes, all of them are my fault. If it weren’t for me, there wouldn’t have been so many disasters. Perhaps I would have already married a scholar, living far away with him, raising children. You would continue on your way, possibly not obtaining the rare treasures, but at least you’d have the chance to play chess with others, and when the time comes, you could bring back some finely printed new chess manuals to send to your daughter and son-in-law…"

She could not speak for a moment, her voice catching in her throat.

The elder remained silent for a long time, finally sighing sadly, "Forget it, silly girl, I don’t blame you for anything."

The two rode slowly, father and daughter.

Some distance down the Tea Horse Road, on a branch of a tree, a blue-clad scholar leaned against the trunk, gently waving his fan, gazing up at the sky with a smile, sighing, "How can there be such a clever woman? Her luck is exceptional. She may be even more calculating than the one from Tongye Prefecture, Yao Jinzhi. If she follows Cui Dongshan up the mountain for a while, who knows how many cultivators she could toy with upon descending? Quite interesting; it can roughly be considered a new game board."

After a moment of silence, he gradually reined in his smile, murmuring to himself, "The game board is new; what about the hearts of people?"

 ### Chapter 612: The Answer Lies with the Bamboo

During the plum rain season, traveling in a foreign land was already an incredibly frustrating affair, especially when it felt like a knife was pressed against one’s throat. This made the old minister Sui Xinyu even more anxious. After passing through several relay stations, he was increasingly moved by the poems of travelers displayed on the walls. On multiple occasions, he sought solace in alcohol, which only served to deepen the concern of the young men and women around him. Yet, the woman in the bamboo veil remained unfazed.

The four riders dared to choose the official road to the capital of Wuling Kingdom. As dusk fell, the torrential rain had just ceased. Despite having pushed their horses to the limit during the storm, they still couldn’t reach the relay station before nightfall. This left the old minister, who had just removed his rain cloak and donned a bamboo hat, in a pitiful state. Scanning his surroundings, he felt an ever-present sense of danger. If not for his relatively robust health and the fact that he often traveled with old friends since retiring to his hometown, he surely would have succumbed to illness long ago, unable to withstand the torment of this frenzied escape.

On the official road, a somewhat unfamiliar face appeared from the hidden side, a young man with a face full of stubble, just thirty steps away from the Sui family riders. He bore a long knife in hand and, without uttering a word, began to charge towards them.

Sui Xinyu shouted, "Sword Immortal, help!"

But the world remained silent.

Then, just as Sui Xinyu pulled the reins to halt his horse, a sound of urgent hoofbeats approached from beside him. The woman in the bamboo veil surged forward on her horse.

In a flash of blade light, she brushed past the man wielding the knife.

It seemed the woman’s waist had been grazed by the knife, causing her delicate body to bend at an angle as she fell from her horse, coughing up blood.

The man continued his charge, slowing only after stumbling several steps before collapsing to the ground.

His face, neck, and chest bore three golden hairpins, which resembled the hidden weapons of martial artists but also had the elegance of flying swords. Had it not been for the sheer quantity, it could have been dangerous—these hairpins had merely pierced through his cheek, leaving a bloody mess, and the one at his heart had missed its mark by an inch, while the one at his neck was the true fatal wound.

The woman in the bamboo veil stumbled to her feet, gingerly touching her abdomen. For some unknown reason, the knife-wielding man had turned the blade onto its back when he struck, seemingly intent on injuring rather than killing. Sui Jingcheng tried to keep his breathing steady, vaguely hearing a faint bang from a great distance.

Turning his head, Sui Jingcheng warned, "Be careful! Get off your horse and take cover!"

Someone had drawn a large bow, and an arrow whistled toward them with a soul-stirring cry.

Blood seeped from the corner of Sui Jingcheng’s mouth, but he endured the sharp pain in his waist, holding his breath and focusing his mind. He recalled the secret techniques from the small booklet gifted to him by a great master years ago. With one hand forming a seal, he twisted his waist, and with a flick of his wrist, the three golden hairpins were pulled from the body on the road, hurtling toward the incoming arrow. The hairpins flew with incredible speed, and though they struck the arrow and sparked three flashes of light, the arrow remained unyielding, racing toward the head of the old minister seated on his horse.

Sui Jingcheng’s face fell into despair. Even though he had secretly given his father the thin silk bamboo robe to wear, if the arrow struck his head, no legendary robe could save him.

Sui Jingcheng’s eyes widened, tears welling up.

In the face of life and death, sincerity was all that mattered.

Though he did not agree with all of his father’s actions and policies, the bond between father and daughter could not be feigned.

Just as the delicate silk bamboo robe had been placed on Sui Xinyu, partly because Sui Jingcheng thought she was temporarily safe, as disaster loomed, not every child would be willing to make such a gamble, especially not a clever girl like Sui Jingcheng, who aspired to long life and cultivation.

In the next moment.

A figure clad in white with a sword appeared out of nowhere, standing right in front of the arrow, pausing it in mid-air near Sui Xinyu and his horse, and then it gently fell to the ground, turning into powder.

Another arrow whistled through the air, this time at an incredible speed, creating a thunderous roar in its wake. Just before the arrow reached them, a sound of bowstring snapping echoed.

Yet the arrow was caught in the hand of the young man in white, shattering with a loud crack.

The white-clad sword immortal turned to the source of the arrow and smiled, "Xiao Shuye, aren’t you a knife-wielding man? Why did you switch to a bow?"

With that, the white-clad sword immortal took off into the air.

Sui Jingcheng shouted, "Be careful of the tiger leaving its den..."

But the transformed sword immortal paid no heed, pursuing his target alone, a white rainbow shooting up into the sky, leaving others in awe.

Sui Jingcheng quickly mounted his horse and, waving his hand, stored the three fallen hairpins in his sleeve, urging the three, "Quick, go!"

The four riders of the Sui family galloped away.

Having ridden several miles, they still could not see the silhouette of the relay station. The old minister felt as though his bones had been rattled from the jolting ride, tears streaming down his face.

Sui Jingcheng raised her arm high and suddenly stopped her horse.

The other three riders quickly pulled on their reins.

On the road, Cao Fu leaned back casually, smiling as he extended a hand to the woman in the bamboo veil. "Jingcheng, come with me to the mountains to cultivate. I can guarantee that once you enter the mountains with me, the descendants of the Sui family will enjoy unparalleled wealth."

Sui Xinyu’s expression shifted wildly.

Sui Jingcheng sneered, "If that were truly the case, why would you, Cao Fu, go to such lengths? Given my father’s and the Sui family’s temperament, they would only hand me over. If I’m not mistaken, a disciple from that muddled river mentioned in passing that the new rankings of the top ten grandmasters have just been released, and that our Wuling Kingdom’s King Dun seems to be at the bottom. Then the so-called four beauties should have their answers. Is it true that I, Sui Jingcheng, have the fortune to be among them? What’s the reasoning behind this? If I’m not mistaken, your master, a terrestrial immortal, has set his sights on me, Sui Jingcheng, but unfortunately, you may not be able to protect me or the Sui family, so you can only scheme behind the scenes to bring me to your Cao Fu’s cultivation place."

Cao Fu retracted his hand, slowly moving forward. "Jingcheng, you have always been so astute, truly remarkable, worthy of being that deeply fated woman. Let’s become partners in the way of the sword. Together, we’ll travel to the mountains, carefree and riding the winds. Wouldn’t that be delightful? Once we become practitioners who dine on clouds and drink dew, time will pass swiftly, and so-called kin will turn to dust. What’s the point in caring? If there is any guilt, as long as the Sui family still has descendants, it will be their blessing. When you and I step into the realm of earth immortals, the Sui family can still easily rise again in Wuling Kingdom."

Sui Xinyu finally understood Cao Fu’s underlying intentions. Only now did she realize that the other party only cared about Sui Jingcheng’s fate. If her daughter left, the Sui family would face disaster.

Sui Xinyu cursed, "Cao Fu, I have always treated you well. Why do you wish to harm the Sui family so?"

Cao Fu smiled, "Uncle Sui has treated me well, choosing me as a son-in-law back then, so I will repay this kindness to the descendants of the Sui family once I cultivate successfully with Jingcheng."

Sui Xinyu was so angry that she had to hold her forehead.

Cao Fu looked far off, "No more pleasantries. Jingcheng, I will give you one last chance. If you willingly come with me, I won’t harm the other three. If you resist and I have to knock you out, then you won’t see the bodies of the other three. You can save yourself the trouble of visiting them in the future, and it will only be you and I who offer sacrifices in the Clear and Bright Festival on my mountain."

Sui Jingcheng discarded the bamboo veil, asking, "You want me to ride to the immortal mountain? Aren’t you afraid the sword immortal will kill Xiao Shuye and come back to trouble you?"

Cao Fu produced a few talismans, confidently declaring, "Now that you are half a practitioner, by applying this talisman, we can barely ride the winds and travel."

Sui Jingcheng dismounted her horse, "I agree."

Cao Fu extended a hand, "That’s more like it. Once you witness the true immortal mountain, immortal masters, and immortal methods, you will understand how wise today’s choice was."

The two stood merely ten steps apart.

Suddenly, three golden hairpins shot out from Sui Jingcheng’s direction, but they were swept up by Cao Fu’s large sleeve, grasped tightly in his hand. Even holding the radiant hairpins caused his palm to burn, flesh splitting and blood spilling.

Cao Fu frowned, taking out a golden talisman given by his master before departing, silently reciting a chant. He wrapped the three hairpins within, and only then did the glowing aura dissipate, placing them carefully into his sleeve. He smiled, "Jingcheng, don’t worry. I won’t be angry with you. Your rebellious nature is precisely what I find most appealing."

Cao Fu’s gaze shifted past Sui Jingcheng, "But if you go back on your word, don’t blame your husband for breaking his promise."

Cao Fu froze for a moment before smiling helplessly, "What’s this? Is there someone behind me? Jingcheng, do you know that understanding destiny and adapting to circumstances is a necessary lesson when cultivating in the mountains?"

Yet Sui Jingcheng’s expression grew strange.

Cao Fu suddenly turned around, but there was no one there.

Sui Jingcheng gritted her teeth, channeling all her meager spiritual energy into her wrist. With a palm glowing white from the energy coursing through her meridians, she lunged forward, striking at Cao Fu’s back of the head.

However, Cao Fu spun around, capturing Sui Jingcheng’s wrist, which was brimming with energy, pulling her toward himself. With a sharp elbow, he struck her forehead, yanking her down to the ground. He stepped on her arm and leaned down, laughing, "Do you know that a true practitioner like me only needs to focus for a moment to see through your lovely autumn-like eyes? I could easily tell if someone is behind me. The only reason I turned around was to give you a glimmer of hope before your despair."

With a twist of his foot, Sui Jingcheng let out a muffled groan. Cao Fu flicked his fingers, tapping her forehead. Immediately, she felt as though she had been struck by a paralyzing spell. "At this point, I should tell you the truth. After the Great Zhuan Dynasty selected you as one of the four beauties, the ‘Jewel of the Sui Family,’ you only have three paths to choose from: either follow your father to the capital of the Great Zhuan and be chosen as a consort for the Crown Prince; be intercepted by a secret envoy from a northern kingdom along the way, to become a queen in some small border state; or be taken to the border sect of the Qingci Kingdom by me, where my master will refine you into a living cauldron, teaching you a secret technique, before passing you on to a true immortal. That would be the master of the Golden Scale Palace. But don’t be scared; this is a great fortune for you. You’ll have the chance to cultivate alongside a Yuan Ying immortal, advancing your cultivation at an astonishing rate. Xiao Shuye is unaware of this, so that chance encounter with the sword cultivator, who is just a Golden Core cultivator from the Golden Scale Palace, is nothing but a ruse. I couldn’t be bothered to expose him; it's better to let Xiao Shuye exert himself a bit more. Even if he dies, this deal will still profit me and my master tremendously."

Cao Fu sighed, "Jingcheng, it seems we are fated not to be. Your earlier divination with copper coins was actually correct."

Cao Fu helped Sui Jingcheng up, producing two talismans and bending down to stick them on her ankles, turning to the three riders of the Sui family, "No matter what, it’s a death sentence."

At that moment, a familiar voice rang out nearby, "Is that all? No more secrets to share? So it is that the founder of the Golden Scale Palace desires Sui Jingcheng, and your master seeks to divide the fateful items associated with her. What about you? After all this scheming and running around, is it all for nothing?"

Cao Fu smiled ruefully, straightening up and turning to see a man in a green shirt and a straw hat standing beside him. Cao Fu asked, "Aren’t you supposed to be chasing Xiao Shuye?"

The man replied, "Traveling in the realm of the yin spirit, you claim to be a true practitioner, yet you have never witnessed it?"

Cao Fu reluctantly said, "Sword cultivators rarely encounter the yin spirit."

The man nodded, "That’s why being out in the world often leads to small troubles."

Cao Fu was about to say something more.

But he suddenly fell back, fainting.

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, dispelling the spiritual energy seal that Cao Fu had placed on Sui Jingcheng’s forehead.

With another flick of his sleeve, he swept the corpse aside, casting it into the distant grass.

Far off, a white rainbow descended from a height of just two or three feet, flying in on a sword, holding a head that refused to close its eyes, which fell onto the road, merging with the figure of the green-clad man, creating ripples.

But the green-clad man now possessed an extra head.

Chen Ping'an said to Sui Jingcheng, "You are so clever. Have you decided how to proceed from here?"

Sui Jingcheng knelt on the ground, beginning to knock her head, "If I remain in Wuling Kingdom, the Sui family will surely perish. Only my absence may offer a glimmer of hope. I implore you, immortal master, to take me as your disciple!"

Chen Ping'an glanced at the bamboo veil that had been discarded by Sui Jingcheng, smiling, "If you had started cultivating earlier, you could have become an immortal master with an orderly lineage. You would have achieved much by now."

---

As night settled heavily over the mountaintops, Cao Fu, with a splitting headache, slowly opened his eyes to find himself sitting cross-legged, cradling an object.

Looking down, his heart sank.

Lifting his head, he saw the young scholar sitting cross-legged by the campfire, a mountain staff resting across his lap, with a bamboo box behind him.

Without the bamboo veil obscuring her breathtaking beauty, Sui Jingcheng sat nearby, hugging her knees, lost in thought.

Cao Fu held the severed head of Xiao Shuye, not daring to move.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Tell me in detail about your sect and the Golden Scale Palace."

Without hesitation, Cao Fu poured out all the secrets and truths he knew, not wanting to accompany Xiao Shuye on the road to the underworld.

His master had said that Xiao Shuye's potential was exhausted, while Cao Fu was different, possessing the aptitude for the Golden Core.

Chen Ping'an continued, "Now, tell me about your family and the affairs of Wuling Kingdom."

Cao Fu continued to speak freely without holding back.

Sui Jingcheng, having come back to her senses when Cao Fu first opened his mouth, listened silently.

After Cao Fu finished, Chen Ping'an said, "You can take this head and discreetly escort the old minister back home before returning to your sect to report."

Sui Jingcheng hesitated.

The man did not look at her, casually saying, "If you want to kill Cao Fu, try it yourself."

Cao Fu's expression changed slightly.

In the end, Cao Fu did not die; he merely left with the head, descending from the mountaintop.

Once off the mountain, it felt like a lifetime had passed. However, fate remained uncertain, and the young immortal, who initially thought of the Wuling Kingdom’s rivers and lakes as a small muddy pond, was still apprehensive.

By the campfire.

Sui Jingcheng suddenly said, "Thank you, senior."

Killing Cao Fu would have been too easy, but for the Sui family, it might not be a good thing.

If both Xiao Shuye and Cao Fu perished tonight, many would die—perhaps the muddied river's jiao, Yang Yuan, the leader of the Crossing Gang, and then the entire Sui family.

Allowing Cao Fu to leave freely to relay messages to his backers was, in itself, a demonstration by that green-clad sword immortal toward Cao Fu's master and the Golden Scale Palace.

Chen Ping'an fiddled with the campfire, "Talking to smart people is always effortless."

Then Sui Jingcheng saw him pull out a chessboard and chess pieces from the bamboo box. Instead of playing chess like in that small pavilion, he began to craft two chess pieces with an immortal's flying sword, carving the names of Cao Fu’s master and the founder of the Golden Scale Palace, along with their mountain names, on opposite sides. Then he crafted several more chess pieces, each representing important practitioners from both sects, placing them carefully on the chessboard.

Sui Jingcheng smiled, "Senior, ever since we met in the pavilion, you’ve been watching us, haven’t you?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Your luck at gambling is quite good; I'm envious."

Sui Jingcheng’s expression grew awkward.

Her self-important schemes seemed to this person as childish as a child playing with a kite, utterly ridiculous.

Chen Ping'an placed the connecting pieces from the previous two games on the edge of the chessboard.

With his hands tucked into his sleeves, he gazed at the pieces, slowly saying, "In my view, there may not be an absolute principle that applies everywhere, but there are absolute facts and truths. Once you see through the hidden truths behind words and actions, understanding the context and sequence, complex matters become simpler. Principles can be elusive, as we saw in our two games of chess."

Chen Ping'an picked up a piece, "Between life and death, human nature can harbor great evil; seeking to survive through any means is understandable. Whether or not one accepts this depends on the person."

He raised the piece and lightly placed it on the board, "Crossing Gang's Hu Xinfeng made the choice of evil at that moment. So he walked the rivers and lakes, and life and death were his own responsibility. From my perspective, he may not be right, but on the chessboard at that time, he was seeking to live and succeeded. Unlike you, Sui Jingcheng, he never guessed that I was also a practitioner and dared to secretly observe the situation."

Sui Jingcheng asked, "If he had sworn to protect the four members of the Sui family, what would you have done?"

Chen Ping'an replied slowly, "Then Wuling Kingdom should continue to have such a true hero, walking the rivers and lakes. After the storm passes, if this hero still wishes to invite me for a drink, I would feel honored."

Chen Ping'an pointed to the two pieces yet to enter the game, "Was it because Cao Fu was a mountain sect immortal or that Xiao Shuye was a martial artist in the Golden Body realm? What, do they think the rivers and lakes below are all shallow ponds where one can see the bottom with a single step? Not just them; I, too, tread carefully, yet still managed to be caught off guard by an unexpected sword strike on my boat and nearly perished near the skeletal marsh and the towering peaks. Thus, the rivers and lakes are treacherous; good or bad, right or wrong, since even the careful can meet death, how much more so for one who seeks it? If one dies, Xiao Shuye can only blame his neck for not being strong enough to withstand a sword's slash."

Chen Ping'an pinched the piece between his fingers, "However, Hu Xinfeng did not choose the path of chivalry but instead let his malicious thoughts erupt. This is human nature, and I won’t kill him for that. I will let him live or die as he wishes; he ultimately fought for a glimmer of survival. So, aside from me, Hu Xinfeng made a correct choice at that moment. As for the events on the Tea Horse Ancient Road, there’s no need to discuss them; that’s a different game of conscience and no longer concerns you."

Chen Ping'an placed the four pieces representing the Sui family on the board, "I knew all along that you were trapped in a chess game, with Cao Fu as the player, and later it was proven that he was one of the pieces. His master and the Golden Scale Palace were the true masters of the chess game. Not to mention the latter, at that time, I faced a dilemma. The crux of the problem was that I did not know Cao Fu's true intentions in setting this trap, who he was as a person, and where his moral lines were drawn with the Sui family. After all, the Sui family is a scholarly lineage, but they too may have committed serious wrongs in the past. Cao Fu’s actions were undoubtedly treacherous and concealed, even pulling in the likes of the muddied river’s jiao, Yang Yuan, into the game. This is not a straightforward matter. However, it does not mean he is not doing something good. Since he did not show up to kill immediately, we could take a step back and consider how at that time I could be sure that what was unfolding for you, Sui Jingcheng, and the Sui family was not a twist of fate leading to a happy resolution?"

Sui Jingcheng nodded lightly.

Chen Ping'an leaned forward, pointing at the piece inscribed with Sui Xinyu's name, "The first person I was disappointed with was not Hu Xinfeng but your father."

Sui Jingcheng asked in confusion, "Why is that? To preserve oneself in a crisis and not dare to save others—I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s how a typical hero of the rivers and lakes would behave. But given your senior's temperament..."

Sui Jingcheng didn’t continue, fearing she might overstep.

Chen Ping'an withdrew his finger, smiling, "A rich child shouldn’t sit under a slanted roof, and a gentleman shouldn’t stand beneath a dangerous wall. There is reason behind these truths. Sui Xinyu’s silence in the pavilion was a sign of seasoned prudence; the fault does not lie there. But let me ask you, what kind of person is your father, Sui Xinyu?"

Sui Jingcheng did not rush to answer. Her father? The head of the Sui family? The foremost player in Wuling Kingdom’s chess scene? Once a minister of the Ministry of Works? Suddenly, she recalled the dress of the senior before her, sighed, and said, "He is a well-read and cultured great scholar of Wuling Kingdom, one who understands many principles of the sages… a scholar."

Chen Ping'an said, "An even more important fact is that Hu Xinfeng did not inform you of the other party's identity, which included the notorious Yang Yuan from the muddied river.

So, at that moment, for Sui Xinyu, the fact was that within the pavilion, it was not a matter of life and death but rather a troublesome situation. Was the name of Hu Xinfeng, the leader of the Crossing Gang, effective within Wuling Kingdom or not?"

Sui Jingcheng blushed, "Of course it is effective. At that time, I thought it was just a farce of the rivers and lakes. So regarding you, senior, I actually had a hint of skepticism. That's why I purposely didn’t ask to borrow money."

Chen Ping'an said, "Because Hu Xinfeng feared bringing trouble upon himself, he didn’t want to expose Yang Yuan’s identity, maintaining a calm demeanor. His warning was just right. This is the wisdom of an old hand, bought with experience. So when I glanced at the old minister, the old minister felt relieved when he saw I didn’t ask to borrow money. This isn’t anything unusual; it's still human nature. However, Sui Xinyu is a scholar; he was once in a high position, using his knowledge of sages to serve the country and help the people..."

At this point, Chen Ping'an raised two thumbs and index fingers, lightly bending them without bringing them together, as if holding a piece, "The sages once said that having a heart of compassion can distinguish humans from plants and animals. Do you think Sui Xinyu, your father, had even a trace of compassion at that time? A little bit, even half? You are his daughter; as long as it’s not too dark, you should know his temperament better than I do."

Sui Jingcheng shook her head, forcing a smile, "He didn’t."

Sui Jingcheng appeared sorrowful, as if speaking to herself, "He really didn’t."

"So, the slow journey through life and the need to observe and reflect have always been a double-edged sword. The more one sees of human affairs, the more one realizes the truth."

However, the man appeared unperturbed, seemingly accustomed to it, and raised his head to gaze into the distance, softly saying, "Between life and death, I have always believed that besides seeking survival, the evils of the world can suddenly appear as mountains. Some people may not grasp this, but there are always a few who, even when faced with certain death, can ignite a flicker of light."

"In the pavilion and along the way thereafter, I was watching; I was waiting."

"As long as I could find a spark of light, even if that glimmer is extinguished with a mere pinch."

"But in my view, even a flicker of human brilliance could rival the sun and moon."

Chen Ping'an continued, "The first time, if Hu Xinfeng had fought desperately for so-called chivalry, risking his life to do something that seemed utterly foolish, I wouldn’t have needed to observe the game any further; I would have moved to help at that moment. The second time, if your father had merely stood by, yet still held even a small trace of compassion, rather than immediately scolding me, I would have chosen to act as well."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Ironically, it was Hu Xinfeng who surprised me. After parting from you, I found Hu Xinfeng. From him, I witnessed a moment—once, before his death, he pleaded with me not to implicate innocent family members. Another time, he inquired whether the four of you should die, stating that Sui Xinyu was actually a decent official and friend. The last time, he naturally spoke of his past deeds of chivalry, his ‘deeds’—a very intriguing term."

Sui Jingcheng said softly, "But regardless, senior, you were always watching. Why, despite your disappointment, did you secretly protect us?"

"The Taoist speaks of blessings and misfortunes having no doors, only summoned by oneself. The Buddhist teaches that yesterday’s causes lead to today’s effects, which are similar. But there are many half-baked mountain immortals who cannot be considered true practitioners. With them around, it becomes even more difficult to explain things."

Chen Ping'an said, "But you were the weak ones trapped in that pavilion. I just happened upon you, thought it through, and had the strength to protect myself, so I didn’t leave. During this time, any suffering you endured, such as fleeing in the rain, or when you were knocked off your horse by a knife, was a result of your own choices and what the world returned to you. In the long run, this may not be a bad thing. After all, you are still alive. Many other weaker people have even more reason to live, yet they simply perish."

The weak often demand more from the strong, and Chen Ping'an felt this was only natural. Even if many weak ones sheltered under the strong had no gratitude, he found it no longer mattered.

After the incident in the Suijia City, bearing the burden of the tribulation cloud, Chen Ping'an had never regretted it.

For in any alley of Suijia City, there might be a Chen Ping'an or a Liu Xianyang quietly growing up.

If calamities persist for a thousand years, with the world and human hearts as they are, it’s hard to change. Good people should be smarter and live longer, rather than letting the kind-hearted suffer, eventually becoming the source of calamities, perpetuating a cycle of evil and strife. One day, everyone must repay the heartless heavens and the great Dao.

Sui Jingcheng pondered silently, tossing several dry branches into the campfire. She wanted to ask why the senior hadn’t annihilated Yang Yuan and his gang of bandits. However, she quickly realized the reasoning and refrained from asking further.

Once the grass was stirred, Cao Fu and Xiao Shuye would only become more patient and cautious.

Sui Jingcheng also considered why the two had not been killed on the Tea Horse Ancient Road but quickly found her own answer.

On what grounds?

What were their moral limits?

Sui Jingcheng rubbed her temples.

She understood many things, yet felt a headache coming on. Did cultivating in the mountains require such restraint? If a practitioner attained a level like the senior, would everything still remain this complicated? If certain situations necessitated immediate action, between saving lives or taking them, how should one proceed with the Dao?

The man seemed to see through Sui Jingcheng’s worries and smiled, "Once you become accustomed to it and observe more people and events, you will find your measure before acting. Whether unsheathing the sword or employing the Dao, it will become swift, almost instant."

He pointed to the pieces on the board, "If Yang Yuan had entered the pavilion and aimed to kill the four members of the Sui family with a single blow, or had I been unable to see through Fu Zhen’s intention to strike Hu Xinfeng, I wouldn't have simply watched from afar. Trust me, neither Fu Zhen nor Hu Xinfeng would understand how they met their ends."

Chen Ping'an looked at Sui Jingcheng, who nodded with a smile.

Previously, she knelt on the official road, and once more she beseeched, "Sui Jingcheng wishes to follow senior to cultivate immortal arts!"

He asked two questions, "On what basis? Why?"

"I have had opportunities since childhood, a natural talent for cultivation, and a precious gift from a great master. I am innately a practitioner, but I have suffered from the lack of an enlightened teacher to guide me. Once I cultivate the immortal arts, I will walk the rivers and lakes just like you, senior!"

Both answers were correct; one was still quite clever.

Thus, Chen Ping'an planned to send her to find Cui Dongshan to follow him in cultivation. He knew how to instruct Sui Jingcheng—not only in immortal arts but also in the ways of life.

As for Sui Jingcheng’s talent, Chen Ping'an dared not make hasty conclusions, but her intelligence was indeed remarkable. Especially her luck in gambling, always good, was not merely the fortune of favor but rather... a skill in gambling.

But this was not the entirety of Chen Ping'an's desire to send Sui Jingcheng to seek Cui Dongshan in Baoping Continent.

After observing two games of chess, Chen Ping'an had certain things he wished to show Cui Dongshan, serving as half an answer to the question posed by the student to the teacher years ago.

Chen Ping'an summoned fifteen flying swords, lightly pinching them as he began to carve on the slender mountain staff, bending down and focused.

Within Sui Jingcheng’s sight, it appeared as though each cut was made right in place.

Sui Jingcheng remained silent, her eyes wide, watching intently as he worked on the mountain staff.

After the time it takes for a stick of incense to burn, Sui Jingcheng’s eyes grew tired, and she rubbed them.

About an hour later, Chen Ping'an sheathed the carving sword, the sword light flashing at his brow.

With a serious expression, Chen Ping'an said, "After you find that person, tell him that I have some thoughts on the answer to that question. However, before answering, two prerequisites must be met: first, the pursuit must be absolutely correct. Second, one must recognize their mistakes and know how to amend them. As for how to amend and how to recognize mistakes, the answer lies within this mountain staff. You let Cui Dongshan see for himself, and I hope he can see more clearly and further than I have. One by one, it represents countless ones, embodying the great Dao and all living beings on earth. He should start from what he can perceive and comprehend. It’s not that the correct result will come and the minor mistakes along the way can be overlooked. There’s no such good fortune in this world; he must review it again and look closely. Otherwise, the so-called correct result will still be a matter of immediate and local interest, not the grand, eternal Dao."

Sui Jingcheng was bewildered, still vigorously nodding.

Chen Ping'an did not rush to hand the mountain staff to Sui Jingcheng, gently pressing his palms against it, raising his head to gaze at the sky, "In cultivation, aside from seizing opportunities, obtaining rare treasures, and learning techniques, observing the subtleties of human hearts is also fundamental to the Dao, as it sharpens the heart of the Dao. You can practice unfeeling methods, but this can also hone your mindset. You comprehend the principles of sages, and you must understand the complexity of human hearts. The human body is a small universe; thoughts are the most unpredictable. This may be difficult at first, but if you confront the challenge, if you succeed by chance, it’s like raising a second bridge to long life, benefiting you throughout your life."

Sui Jingcheng saw that Chen Ping'an merely looked up at the night sky.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an said, "On the way to the immortal ferry to the Green Oriole Kingdom, do you think there’s anything that needs to be addressed regarding the safety of the Sui family? If you think of anything, you can share it without worrying about inconveniencing me. Even if it means turning back to Wuling Kingdom, that’s fine."

Chen Ping'an’s fingers lightly tapped twice on the mountain staff, "After delineating and segmenting, it becomes a single matter. How to achieve the best is a form of cultivation as well. If something extends too far from both ends, it may not be done well; this applies to human effort and reason."

Sui Jingcheng recalled how he had spoken plainly on their way up the mountain. She smiled and shook her head, "Senior, your thoughts are thorough, even including King Dun. I have nothing further to say."

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "No need to rush to conclusions. No one in this world has an infallible plan. You need not feel that just because I am more highly skilled now, I must be without error. If I were you, Sui Jingcheng, trapped in the pavilion, not discussing the quality of intent, merely escaping, I wouldn’t have done better than you did."

The man withdrew his gaze, his eyes clear as he looked at her.

Sui Jingcheng had never seen such bright, pure light in any man's eyes. He smiled, "It seems this journey will require some time. While you discuss principles with me, I will listen. Regardless of whether what you say holds merit, I am willing to hear you out first. If there is truth, then you are correct, and I will admit my mistakes. In the future, you will find out whether I was merely being polite."

"Then with me here, even if it’s just me, you cannot claim that all principles of the world lie with those with hard fists and high Dao. If anyone tells you that those with the strongest fists have the right, do not believe them. They have suffered enough, but still, they are not satisfied. For such people, in their lives, they are unknowingly protected by countless invisible rules."

"Moreover, there are many like me; you just haven’t encountered them yet, or perhaps you have, but because of their reasoning, like spring winds and gentle rains, nurturing things silently, you haven’t noticed."

The man turned to face her, saying, "I hope that regardless of whether it is ten years or a hundred years from now, Sui Jingcheng will still be that person who can willingly leave behind a life-saving treasure for others. In the world, with countless lights, even if you become a mountain practitioner in the future and look down, you can still discover that even if those lights are dim in their respective households, once every household lights a lamp, it creates a magnificent scene of the river of stars. Today, we have practitioners in this world, and so many mundane scholars depend on these unremarkable lights to emerge from every corner—street and alley, rural and urban, scholarly and noble estates, royal palaces, mountain immortals—one after another, true strong beings emerge, paving the way for the future generations with fists and swords and the genuine principles containing righteous aura, quietly protecting countless弱者."

The man turned his head, smiling, "So say you and I, being a wise man and a bad man—is it difficult? I don’t see it as difficult. What’s hard about it? It’s difficult in that we know the treachery of human hearts yet are willing to be good people who need to pay a price for the principles in our hearts."

Sui Jingcheng's face flushed, "Senior, I am still far from that!"

The man squinted and laughed, "Well, I’ll accept that compliment."

Sui Jingcheng was taken aback.

The man continued to gaze into the distance, resting his chin on his hands, softly laughing, "You’ve also helped me resolve a mental knot, so I must thank you. That is learning how to interact with beautiful women. Thus, when I go to the Sword Qi Great Wall next time, I’ll be even more justified. Because I have seen many beautiful women in the world, I won’t feel guilty for looking at them."

After a moment’s hesitation, Sui Jingcheng felt it necessary to offer some well-meaning but unflattering advice, timidly saying, "Senior, it's best to keep such words to yourself and never speak them directly to a beloved woman; it’s not endearing."

The man turned his head, puzzled, "Can’t say that?"

Sui Jingcheng nodded vigorously, adamantly stating, "Absolutely cannot!"

The man rubbed his chin, appearing somewhat conflicted.

Sui Jingcheng’s expression brightened, "Senior, I am also one of the good-looking women, right?"

The man did not turn his head, seemingly in a good mood, jokingly saying, "Don’t ruin my Dao."

Sui Jingcheng dared not push her luck.

But for her, being named the "Jewel of the Sui Family" among several kingdoms, alongside three other unparalleled beauties, was ultimately a matter of joy for a woman.

Feeling her heart lighten, she became somewhat drowsy, shaking her head and reaching out to warm herself by the fire. After a moment, she turned to look, noticing that the mountain staff remained in place while the figure in the azure robe began to practice stances?

Sui Jingcheng rubbed her eyes, asking, "Once we arrive at the legendary immortal ferry, will you return to the skeletal marsh in the south with me?"

The man continued to punch, shaking his head, "No, so you must be extra careful on the ferry. Of course, I will do my best to minimize any unforeseen incidents, but the path of cultivation must ultimately be walked by yourself."

Sui Jingcheng hesitated to speak.

The man added, "The mountain staff is related to your life. If you must make a choice, do not hesitate; life is more important."

Sui Jingcheng helplessly replied, "Senior, do you know everything?"

The man pondered for a moment and casually asked, "How old are you this year?"

Sui Jingcheng fell silent, turning away sullenly, throwing several dry branches into the campfire.

(End of Chapter)

 ## Chapter 613: An Honor to Meet You

As the night deepened, Su Jingcheng found herself wide awake after having endured the most drowsy moments. There was a saying in novels about night owls, and she felt it perfectly described her current state.

The booklet she had been studying detailed various breathing techniques, all meant for practice during the midday sessions, with slight variations based on the seasons. At the end of the scroll, four words struck her deeply: **Ascend in Broad Daylight.**

Earlier, during their farewell on the official road, the old minister had removed his thin, cicada-wing-like bamboo robe and returned it to his daughter, Su Jingcheng, with a heavy heart. He had privately warned her that her fortunate opportunity to follow the Sword Immortal to learn the Dao on the mountain was protected by their ancestors' spirits, urging her to maintain a proper demeanor and discard any airs of a noble young lady. If she failed to do so, it would be a waste of their ancestors' blessings.

Meanwhile, the man beside her continued practicing the dull and monotonous stance training.

Su Jingcheng rose and gathered some dry twigs from around her, mimicking what she had seen before. She first roasted them by the campfire to evaporate the moisture, rather than tossing them directly into the flames.

Over the years, her cultivation had been a series of ups and downs, fraught with difficulties. Without a knowledgeable master to guide her and with the booklet's contents being mostly cryptic, she had only grasped about seventy to eighty percent of the practical technique of wielding a golden hairpin like a flying sword. The rest of the writings felt like mere philosophical musings, too abstract and high-minded, leaving her perplexed. Despite having struggled with the text since childhood, Su Jingcheng still felt she had not grasped its essence. Thus, even at just over thirty, she remained a Qi practitioner stuck at the second realm.

In truth, Su Jingcheng hesitated, contemplating whether to reveal the bamboo robe, the golden hairpin, and the booklet—three treasures of the celestial realm. If the powerful Sword Immortal took a liking to them, she wouldn't mind, but she feared he would think her merely attempting to show off her cleverness, having failed at that more than once.

Chen Ping'an stopped his stance training, returned to the campfire, and extended his hand. "Let me ease your mind; bring them out."

With care, Su Jingcheng took out three golden hairpins and a pristine, unblemished booklet titled **The Supreme Mysterious Collection**.

In a whisper, she said, "Senior, the hairpins are a bit strange. They've been connected to me since childhood. If someone else holds them, they will get burned. A maid once tried to steal one when I was little and ended up scorching her palm, rolling on the ground in pain, which soon alerted everyone at the residence. Even after her hand healed, she seemed to have lost her mind, alternating between clarity and foolishness, for reasons unknown."

"It’s fine,” Chen Ping'an replied.

He accepted the booklet with one hand and opened it with the other. As Su Jingcheng released her grip, the three shimmering hairpins fell into his palm. The hairpins trembled slightly, but Chen Ping'an's hand remained unharmed. After examining them for a moment, he slowly said, “These hairpins are your life-bound treasures. In the world of artifact refinement, there are three tiers. The first tier can barely be stored within a cultivator's Qi chambers, but anyone can seize it. The second tier can activate the various functions of a celestial artifact, akin to this nameless mountain, which has the protection of a mountain god and temple. The third tier is a life-bound treasure. The person who gifted you these opportunities is truly remarkable. Their methods are undoubtedly profound, likely at the level of an Earth Immortal, and perhaps even a Nascent Soul cultivator. As for why they abandoned you after providing you with the chance to ascend the mountain, it has been thirty years…”

“I’ve only been waiting for thirty-two years,” Su Jingcheng interjected softly.

Chen Ping'an chuckled. “Should we count the months too?”

Su Jingcheng’s face flushed with embarrassment.

Chen Ping'an placed the booklet on his knee and picked up one of the hairpins, gently tapping it against another in his palm. The sound was crisp, like the clash of metal, and each strike sent ripples of light radiating outward. He looked up and said, “These three hairpins form a complete set of treasures. Though they appear identical, they are not. They are respectively named ‘Spirit Essence and Clarity,’ ‘Literary Spirit in the Divine Heavens,’ and ‘Great Radiance Commanding Ghosts.’ They are likely related to the supreme path of Thunder.”

Su Jingcheng was taken aback, genuinely impressed. “Senior, you truly are well-informed, knowing all these things!”

Her words came straight from her heart.

These three seemingly identical hairpins had their names revealed so effortlessly? 

Chen Ping'an glanced at her. “The hairpins bear inscriptions, but the characters are extremely small. With your current cultivation, you naturally cannot see them.”

Su Jingcheng's expression stiffened.

Chen Ping'an gently tossed the three hairpins back to her and began flipping through the peculiar booklet. He frowned, having turned only a couple of pages before closing it immediately.

The text in **The Supreme Mysterious Collection** shimmered with light as he opened it, and even with his keen eyesight and memory, he could not grasp even a general idea of the content. It was as if a well-ordered battlefield suddenly fell into chaos, becoming disordered. Without a doubt, this was another of Su Jingcheng's life-bound treasures, likely only visible to her alone. Even if Chen Ping'an allowed her to hold the booklet, their understanding of its contents would still be vastly different.

Chen Ping'an gestured for Su Jingcheng to sit beside him and let her browse through the book. Dazed, she complied as he soon instructed her to put the booklet away. “This celestial technique is of considerable rank, but it’s incomplete. The person who gifted you the book must have had extremely high hopes for you. However, without a mentor to guide you or a protector, you have been left to fend for yourself for over thirty years.”

Su Jingcheng clutched the hairpin in one hand and the booklet in the other, her face radiant with joy, feeling more elated than when she had learned she was the “Jade Lady of the Su Clan.”

Chen Ping'an began to close his eyes and focus, his hands gently resting on a golden thunder whip that resembled green bamboo. 

The “green bamboo” bore no inscriptions, only countless intricate carvings.

Suddenly, Su Jingcheng asked, “Senior, would you like to see the bamboo robe?”

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes, a strange look on his face. Seeing her earnest and eager expression, he sighed in resignation. “No need. It must be a fine treasure. Robes are always precious, especially in mountain cultivation, where danger lurks. Generally speaking, Qi practitioners have two life-bound treasures: one for offense and one for defense. Since that eminent person gifted you three hairpins, the bamboo robe is likely of similar quality.”

Realizing this too late, Su Jingcheng felt her cheeks flush and fell silent.

After a moment of silence, Chen Ping'an ceased his stance practice and began to meditate like a cultivator, his breathing steady. Subtly, Su Jingcheng felt layers of radiance emanating from him, bright as a flame, gentle as the moonlight. She believed that this Sword Immortal was indeed an enlightened being, his aura shifting and numerous, and even with her meager understanding of the Dao, she could sense the faint signs. In fact, Su Jingcheng was an exceptionally gifted cultivator; her inability to see the hairpin's inscriptions was due to her limited eyesight, while her ability to perceive Chen Ping'an’s aura indicated her extraordinary talent and sensitivity to the spiritual energy of the world, far surpassing ordinary practitioners at the lower levels.

After a moment, Su Jingcheng recalled something significant. After hesitating for a while, she felt the matter was not trivial and asked, “Senior, is it true that Cao Fu and Xiao Shuye are taking a roundabout way to avoid attracting the attention of the Great Zhuan Dynasty and a certain emperor from a northern small kingdom? Is it also because that eminent person who gifted me these opportunities is someone they fear? Perhaps Master Cao Fu, that Golden Core Earth Immortal, and the head of the Jinlin Palace are reluctant to show themselves because they are wary of such a person? When Cao Fu had that armed ruffian take the lead to test whether the Sword Immortal was hiding nearby, was it for the same reason?”

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes once more and smiled without answering.

This Su Jingcheng was truly perceptive.

He patiently explained, “Once a cultivator makes an enemy on the mountain, it’s easy for that enmity to last for a hundred years. There are rules in the mountains, as there are in the Jianghu. Cao Fu and Xiao Shuye genuinely look down on the Jianghu, thinking they can dominate it simply by stepping down from the mountain; in their eyes, it’s just a gathering of small fish and shrimp. However, they do not understand the complexities of the cultivation world and its taboos, and their backers are surely aware of this as well. That’s why they are cautious of me. Cao Fu only fears my flying sword, but their backers must have another layer of concern: the wandering expert you have already considered. If your messenger is merely an Earth Immortal from another region, they may not mind taking action for a bigger deal. However, if your messenger is a Golden Core Sword Cultivator sent by your wandering expert, then their backers must weigh their own strength and resources, as they would need to consider if they can withstand the retaliation of two ‘Nascent Soul cultivators.’”

Su Jingcheng's eyelashes trembled slightly.

His words were straightforward yet carried hidden threats. Being a clever woman, Su Jingcheng pondered deeply, feeling as if the grand landscape she had envisioned in her mind was slowly revealing itself.

Su Jingcheng asked a question that was uncharacteristic of her usual demeanor, “Senior, are you truly not taking any of the celestial items?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head. “Taking what is rightfully yours.”

Su Jingcheng smiled knowingly.

Chen Ping'an suddenly asked, “Do you have no other thoughts?”

Su Jingcheng was taken aback, thought for a moment, and shook her head. “No more.”

Chen Ping'an said, “Cao Fu previously used Xiao Shuye to lure me away, mistakenly believing he had the upper hand. When he directly told you about his experience after going up the mountain with him, did that not frighten you?”

Su Jingcheng truly felt a lingering dread. The thought of being transformed into a living furnace by Master Cao Fu and subsequently cultivating dual practices with the old ancestor of Jinlin Palace was daunting.

Though Su Jingcheng was devoted to the Dao, she did not wish to become such a pitiful marionette.

Chen Ping'an sighed. “Have you ever considered the initial intentions of the one who gifted you these opportunities? Have you thought of the possibility that this person might be more powerful than Cao Fu's backer, with more malicious intent and a longer-term scheme?”

Su Jingcheng broke out in a cold sweat.

Chen Ping'an raised his hand, gesturing for her not to be overly frightened, and gently said, “This is merely a possibility. Why did he dare to give you three treasures? Not only did he provide you with a tremendous opportunity for cultivation, but he also placed you in danger without you realizing it. Why didn’t he take you directly to his celestial sect? Why didn’t he assign a protector to you? Why was he so certain that you could become a cultivator on your own? What was the significance of your mother’s dream of a divine being holding a baby girl?”

Su Jingcheng wiped the sweat from her forehead, then pressed her hand against her forehead and shook her head. “I can’t make sense of it all.”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “Most matters in this world are like that; no matter how much you think about them, you won’t find clarity. And sometimes, knowing the truth isn’t necessarily a good thing.”

Su Jingcheng looked confused.

In recent days, with her life turned upside down like a stray dog, experiencing twists and turns, the events of this night and the man’s every word had sent her emotions soaring and plummeting.

Chen Ping'an said, “After you decided to go to Baopingzhou, I’ve shared these thoughts with you so that you can make another choice in your heart about how to treat that wandering high expert who may never appear again or may show up tonight. Suppose this high expert harbors good intentions. Perhaps at the beginning of your cultivation, he was overly protective to avoid pushing you too hard. However, he still does not know about the matters concerning the Wuling Kingdom and the Su family. After all, cultivators at higher realms often lose touch with the world. Therefore, you can temporarily head to Baopingzhou, but do not rush to take Cui Dongshan as your master. If that person had ill intentions from the start, then there is no such concern. However, we still cannot ascertain the truth of the matter. What shall we do?”

Su Jingcheng sleepily countered, “What should we do?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled. “What should we do, indeed?”

Su Jingcheng wiped her face and suddenly laughed. “If I had met someone else who saved me before meeting you, I wouldn’t have cared about anything and would have run as far away as possible. Even if I felt guilty towards that wandering high expert who had done me a great favor in the past, I would have tried my best not to think about it. Now I feel that the Sword Immortal is right; those scholars down the mountain, when faced with danger, prioritize their own safety. But there should still be a hint of compassion. So, whether it is you, the Sword Immortal, or that senior Cui Dongshan, even if I am fortunate enough to become a disciple of one of you, I will remain nominally so until I reunite with that wandering high expert in this lifetime. Even if he is not as accomplished as both of you, I will humbly request your permission to change my master and take that wandering high expert as my teacher!”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “That’s the right way to think.”

More remarkably, Chen Ping'an could see Su Jingcheng's sincerity in her words.

Some things must be understood through observation rather than mere listening.

This was the beauty of cultivation in the mountains.

Thus, Chen Ping'an sighed, “I hope my earlier speculation was merely a product of my dark thoughts. I genuinely hope that you and that wandering high expert can become master and disciple in the future, ascending the mountain together to behold its majesty.”

Su Jingcheng laughed secretly, narrowing her eyes to look at him.

In an instant, Chen Ping'an understood the silent message in her gaze and shot her a glare. “You and I may see the world in the same way, but our hearts are vastly different.”

Unable to suppress her laughter, Su Jingcheng's youthful spirit shone through as she began to look around. “Master, where are you?”

Who knows if that master would be like the earlier Sword Immortal in the blue robe who carried a bamboo box, possibly far away or right in front of her?

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but laugh.

Of course, Su Jingcheng's "master" did not show up.

After that, the two didn’t try to conceal their whereabouts. However, since Su Jingcheng needed to practice at fixed times during the day, while heading towards the capital of Wuling Kingdom, Chen Ping'an bought a carriage and acted as the driver. Su Jingcheng proactively began discussing some key points from **The Supreme Mysterious Collection**, explaining how, during breathing exercises at different times, one would experience various phenomena, such as their eyes becoming warm and moist as if filled with mist, feeling a prickling sensation like electric currents, and hearing resonances from within their organs. Chen Ping'an didn’t really have any advice to give; furthermore, Su Jingcheng was a lay practitioner who had been cultivating for almost thirty years without any signs of illness, and her skin remained delicate, her eyes clear, indicating that she was unlikely to face any significant issues.

The journey was smooth, day and night without pause.

It was reminiscent of the time he had escorted Li Huai and the others to the Dazhou Academy, filled with bumps and laughter, but also more mundane and lively interactions.

Just like how Li Huai needed Chen Ping'an to accompany him whenever he had to relieve himself, especially at night. Even if Chen Ping'an had already fallen into a deep slumber after keeping watch, he would still be awakened by Li Huai, who would then drag him along, hands covering his pants or holding his rear as they walked away together. That was how it had been all along, and Chen Ping'an had never said anything to Li Huai, nor had Li Huai expressed any words of gratitude.

However, country folk were indeed not accustomed to saying "thank you." Just like scholars were generally reluctant to admit they were wrong.

Yet, in the end, it was clear that Li Huai cared. Among the group back then, he was the one who cared the most about Chen Ping'an. Even after so many years and having made his own friends while studying in the academy, Li Huai still bore the mentality of that timid boy from their past. When faced with trouble, the first person he thought of was Chen Ping'an, not his faraway parents or sister. It was a different kind of deep bond, one of dependence and longing.

Meanwhile, Su Jingcheng, though a half-hearted cultivator, had her own troubles, particularly as a woman.

When Chen Ping'an had intentionally lingered for a day in a bustling county town to buy the carriage, the burdened Su Jingcheng borrowed some silver from him under the pretext of buying a few items. She ended up purchasing a new dress and a face veil to cover her features.

Not that he was intentionally taking care of Su Jingcheng; it was just that Chen Ping'an himself wasn’t in a hurry to travel. He had a general sense of the route and knew he wouldn’t delay arriving in the Green Oriole Kingdom until autumn.

Thus, one evening, as dusk fell by a rocky riverbank, Chen Ping'an took out a fishing rod and began to fish. He unexpectedly caught a ten-pound snail-like creature, and while they enjoyed the snail soup together, he spoke of a certain miraculous place in Tongyezhou where the snails in a mountain lake would contain pure stones of varying sizes in their mouths after living for a hundred years. Crushing and drying those stones would yield materials sought after by talisman practitioners.

Su Jingcheng was astonished.

Occasionally, they would play games of strategy, and Su Jingcheng finally confirmed her suspicion that this Sword Immortal truly was a terrible player. He seemed adept at making strong opening moves but quickly fell apart.

During their first game, Su Jingcheng had been quite solemn, convinced that the senior had been holding back during their earlier match at the pavilion. However, she soon resigned herself to the fact that this senior was merely recalling some basic opening patterns.

Fortunately, the senior didn’t seem embarrassed at all. After losing ten games straight, he would humbly seek her advice on certain clever moves, and Su Jingcheng naturally didn’t hold back. Eventually, while wandering through a bookstore in a county town, she selected two books on strategy: one titled **The Great Official Game** focused on life-and-death scenarios, and another dedicated to fixed openings. Since the senior had given her some gold and silver before, she had enough left over to make the purchases.

Once, while traveling at night and passing by a desolate graveyard, the senior suddenly halted the carriage and called Su Jingcheng out. With two fingers, he gently tapped her forehead, urging her to focus on a particular spot. When she lifted her veil, she saw a white fox at the grave, carrying a skeleton and bowing to the moon. When she asked why, he confessed he didn’t know, stating that he had seen many fox spirits transform into beautiful maidens to seduce wandering scholars, but this was his first encounter with one bowing while carrying bones.

The carriage continued onward.

After the white fox vanished, a short while later, they noticed a graceful woman on the roadside, trying to attract attention. Chen Ping'an ignored her, while Su Jingcheng, annoyed, removed her veil to reveal her true appearance. The woman seemed struck by thunder, muttering angrily before turning to leave. With a raised eyebrow, Su Jingcheng put her veil back on and dangled her legs outside the carriage.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Why are you angry with a fox spirit?”

Su Jingcheng replied, “Those who transform into women to seduce men, it’s no wonder that people in the marketplace often refer to them as ‘saucy foxes.’ Once I achieve immortality, I’ll make sure to teach them a good lesson.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Not all fox spirits are like that; some are mischievous but kind-hearted. I’ve also heard that in the Dragon Tiger Mountain Tianshi Mansion of Central Earth, there’s a celestial fox that has been worshiped. It owes its gratitude to the old Tianshi who helped it avoid a great calamity when it attempted to ascend to the upper realms, so it has been protecting the disciples of the Tianshi Mansion ever since, even helping them strengthen their resolve.”

Su Jingcheng silently noted this astonishing tale, though her final thought was that the fox spirit might not be as beautiful as herself.

One evening, as they passed an ancient temple that had once been a site of turbulent waters, making it impossible for boats to cross, an ancient immortal had drawn talismans on paper, causing a stone rhinoceros to leap into the water and suppress the water monsters, resulting in calm waters thereafter. Su Jingcheng entered the temple with Chen Ping'an to burn incense. The shopkeeper at the incense shop was a young couple, who seemed disappointed when they learned she didn’t need lodging, as Su Jingcheng’s identity as a member of the Su clan was not something ordinary dignitaries could compare with.

During the rain, even though Su Jingcheng kept her veil on, the shopkeeper still had servants bring them tea.

It wasn’t long before a young gentleman, handsome and graceful, arrived, exchanging pleasantries and inquiring whether the lady was skilled in the game of strategy. Su Jingcheng handled herself flawlessly, and the young gentleman was well-mannered and did not seem to feel awkward despite running out of things to say. Even the young coachman in a blue robe managed to engage in conversation, claiming to be a family cousin delivering a letter to this lady, and he was quite enthusiastic, displaying none of the airs of a noble.

After the rain ceased, the young gentleman personally escorted them to the door of the residence. After watching them leave, he smiled and said, “She must be a rare beauty, like a lonely orchid in an empty valley. What a shame I couldn’t behold her beauty.”

The old doorman, seemingly familiar with the young gentleman's temperament, joked, “Why didn’t the second young master personally escort them a little further?”

The young man shook his head, returning to the residence to engage in a game of strategy with a beautiful maid.

As they traveled down the road, Su Jingcheng sat beside the carriage curtain, lifted her veil slightly, and asked, “Senior, if the other party develops ulterior motives and causes trouble, would I be at fault? Wouldn’t there be a bit of blame on my part, given that my beauty is before their eyes, leading them to covet me?”

Chen Ping'an sighed. This was the problem with the concepts of context and sequence, which could easily entangle one in a web of confusion. It sometimes seemed that there were villains everywhere, and every person had ill intentions. Yet, the vile acts of these individuals appeared to have some rationale.

If Chen Ping'an were truly her mentor or protector, he typically wouldn’t speak so plainly, allowing her to ponder it herself. But since he was neither and she was already wise enough, he simply said, “The order of events is not as you described; the world is filled with shades of right and wrong. Especially within the established customs of a region or nation, certain truths are immutable. Coveting wealth and committing acts of violence, or developing lustful intentions and using one’s power to bully others, are unquestionably wrong. It is neither wrong to be wealthy nor wrong for a woman to be beautiful. Once you comprehend these principles, we can then discuss the sequence of events and the magnitude of right and wrong. Otherwise, even if a woman is flirtatious and draws attention, it does not justify her being kidnapped. Just like a child carrying gold through the market or the saying that ‘possessing treasures invites trouble,’ do you truly believe the child is at fault? Is the one who possesses treasures at fault? No, it is merely how the world is structured, leading to such unfortunate old sayings, meant to warn good people and the weak to be more cautious.”

Chen Ping'an turned his head and smiled, “The world has always been this way, hasn’t it? I think not.”

Su Jingcheng’s eyes sparkled. “Senior, such insight!”

Chen Ping'an turned his head, smiling, “Is this truly insight? If the teachings of sages could come to life, I imagine countless scholars would either be driven mad or wish they could tear open their own bellies to let little men run back to the books.”

Su Jingcheng cautiously asked, “Does Senior hold any prejudice against scholars?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head. “A person is not a scholar simply because they are well-versed in poetry and literature, nor are they not a scholar merely because they are illiterate.”

Su Jingcheng was about to express a sentiment when Chen Ping'an interrupted, “Let’s not indulge in flattery.”

Su Jingcheng couldn’t help but feel bashful. “You truly are perceptive, Senior.”

Chen Ping'an turned his head.

Su Jingcheng blinked, silently lowering the curtain of the carriage and sitting properly. She could not suppress the smile that spread across her face.

Soon, they entered the capital of Wuling Kingdom, where they visited notable landmarks, and the senior would stop the carriage to take a look, sometimes carving inscriptions from plaques and couplets onto bamboo slips.

Along the way, they encountered wandering young heroes in the Jianghu, who galloped past, their sleeves and horse manes fluttering in the wind.

They also passed through rural villages where groups of children played and laughed, leaping over a stream. Even some frail girls took a few steps back before charging across. 

One child, standing boldly by the stream, attempted to jump over without running, instead shaking his arms as if to gather strength, only to fall straight into the water.

At that moment, the carriage was parked nearby, and Su Jingcheng caught a glimpse of the senior's profile. He squinted, a smile playing on his lips as he watched the scene unfold.

The carriage wound its way around the capital of Wuling Kingdom, heading north towards the estate of Wang Dun, the top figure in the Jianghu.

Since they hadn’t intentionally detoured around the county towns, they had picked up various bits of news that had already spread throughout the court and Jianghu.

Wang Dun had made it onto the newly released top ten list, coming in last. While being at the bottom of the list, Wuling Kingdom still celebrated this achievement. 

After all, there were five names from the Great Zhuan Dynasty alone, and it was said that a few reclusive old masters were not even included. The Qingci Kingdom had only Xiao Shuye ranked ninth, while the Jinfei Kingdom, known for its fierce people and strong military, had no representatives at all. Even the Lan Fang Kingdom could not hope for a mention. Thus, even being last on the list was a significant honor for the old master Wang Dun and was a source of pride for the scholars of Wuling Kingdom, who were often considered lacking in heroism.

The emperor of Wuling Kingdom specifically sent emissaries from the capital to present a plaque.

So, Su Jingcheng guessed that the estate of Wang Dun must be filled with high-profile guests coming to congratulate him.

However, she had no idea whether the old master had met with the emperor of the Great Zhuan Dynasty, having returned on a celestial ferry after visiting the capital.

As for the news regarding Su Jingcheng, it was equally lively and stirred up much excitement, especially among the Jianghu folks, who spoke of it with a mix of admiration and discontent. 

Every time Su Jingcheng would steal a glance at her senior, whether they were dining in a tavern or sipping on cheap tea at a tea stall, she felt a pang of disappointment.

They also encountered groups of literati drinking in beautiful landscapes. Some would raise their cups and proclaim, “In the woods, I am a giant tree; out of the mountain, I am but a little grass,” their faces streaked with tears, while others would rise to perform sword dances, filled with fervor.

The carriage slowly passed by.

Su Jingcheng said with a smile, “If it were a gathering of renowned scholars, do you know which two types of people are indispensable?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head with a smile. “I’ve never attended one; you tell me.”

Su Jingcheng grinned. “In these gatherings, there must be someone who can write poetry that resonates with the heart, and it would be even better if there were also a skilled painter who can capture everyone's appearance. With one of these, one can leave their name in history; with both, it becomes a beautiful tale that lasts for a thousand years.”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “That’s quite reasonable. I’ll be sure to share this with a friend; perhaps he will include it in his travel notes.”

Su Jingcheng, wearing her veil, covered her mouth and laughed, leaning back against the carriage as she swung her legs.

As they approached the estate, Chen Ping'an sold the carriage at a discount in a county town.

He requested two rooms at an inn near the county, where the presence of Jianghu folk was noticeably higher, likely drawn there to congratulate him.

It had to be acknowledged that the bonds formed in Jianghu could be cultivated just as friendships could over a drink.

Those who became respected elders in the Jianghu were either exceptionally skilled fighters, whose bad temper could be overlooked, or old foxes with second-rate martial arts but excellent reputations. As for the younger generation, who understood the rules of Jianghu, they had simply waited for the previous generation to pass away, and when the chairs of the second-rate elders became vacant, they naturally took their places. However, this kind of rise to prominence was somewhat lacking in merit. Thus, those brash young talents were often not favored by the older generation.

However, according to Su Jingcheng, the old master Wang Dun was truly a person of great virtue and reputation.

Chen Ping'an stood by the window, observing the bustling street for a while.

He knocked on the door next door and mentioned that he wanted to sit in the tavern, planning to buy a few pots of wine.

Su Jingcheng, donning her veil again, stepped out of the threshold, feeling a bit anxious. She expressed her desire to join him for a drink by the roadside. She had only seen such scenes in Jianghu novels, where heroes gathered, feasting and drinking heartily, and she was curious to try it out.

Chen Ping'an didn’t stop her.

The two arrived at a lively tavern at the street corner, waiting for a table to clear after a group had settled their bill. Chen Ping'an ordered a pot of wine and poured her a bowl.

As Su Jingcheng wore her veil, she had to lower her head, revealing just a corner of her face to drink.

The tables in the tavern were not far apart, and a raucous atmosphere prevailed. Some engaged in drinking games, while others exchanged amusing tales from Jianghu. A man seated behind Su Jingcheng, amidst a group of Jianghu friends, shared a smile with them and then stretched out his hand to playfully attempt to knock Su Jingcheng’s veil off her head. Fortunately, she managed to lean forward just in time to avoid it. 

The man was momentarily taken aback but didn’t press further. However, he couldn’t contain himself any longer; he thought the woman before him was truly striking and felt it would be a loss not to take a look. Before his table could make any moves, a group of Jianghu heroes arrived, wearing fine clothes and riding spirited horses. They dismounted without tying their steeds and looked around, spotting the pair seated across from each other. Just by the way the woman sat elegantly, it was as if she were the best wine in the county. One burly man boldly sat between them on the bench, cupping his fists with a smile, “I’m Lu Dayong from the Wuh lakes gang. Friends in Jianghu should look out for each other. I go by the nickname ‘The River-Overturning Flood Dragon!’”

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, “An honor to meet you, an honor to meet you!”

This Lu the Hero was accompanied by three companions. He grinned broadly, saying, “Mind if we sit together? Jianghu fellows shouldn’t be too particular; squeezing together will do…”

However, just as he was about to invite his friends to take their seats, one of them stood up, intending to give up his spot to Lu Dayong, preparing to squeeze in with Su Jingcheng. In Jianghu, camaraderie was valued, and there were no outdated customs prohibiting male and female interactions.

To his surprise, the young man smiled and said, “I do mind.”

Lu Dayong, clearly not expecting such a response, had already risen, and upon getting a whiff of a fragrance more enticing than the wine, he intended to sit beside Su Jingcheng.

But in the next moment, not only did this Jianghu hero stop in his tracks, but the onlookers who had heard the words “I mind” also fell silent. One after another, they swallowed their saliva, and some even began to rise, planning to make a hasty exit.

Because a delicate, emerald-green flying sword hovered mere inches from the center of Lu Dayong's forehead.

The young man in the blue robe smiled. “Now, do you mind squeezing together for a drink?”

Mind? Or not mind?

Lu Dayong felt that no matter how he responded, he would be in a difficult position.

The three Jianghu friends behind him stood still, observing with bated breath, likely due to their unfamiliarity with the River-Overturning Flood Dragon.

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, and Lu Dayong and his companions sprinted away.

The other patrons, too, wore anxious expressions and were about to flee.

However, the legendary “Sword Immortal” added, “Settle the bill before leaving.”

As a result, several tables of heroes hastily tossed silver coins toward the counter before hastily departing.

Except for Chen Ping'an and Su Jingcheng, the tavern was now deserted.

Feigning exhaustion, Chen Ping'an glanced around, and the sword hovering in midair shook slightly before floating down to the table, quickly disappearing into his sleeve.

Su Jingcheng couldn’t help but smile.

The old shopkeeper, caught off guard by the sudden influx of wealth after witnessing the scene, smiled and said, “You mountain sword cultivators really aren’t afraid of attracting even bigger troubles? Jianghu heroes tend to hold grudges and are adept at banding together, often siding with the weak against the strong.”

Chen Ping'an turned to smile at him. “With an eminent figure like you watching over this tavern, there shouldn’t be too much trouble.”

The old shopkeeper chuckled. “You have good eyes, young man.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Mutual admiration.”

Su Jingcheng softly asked, “Can I take off my veil now?”

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Su Jingcheng removed her veil, finally able to drink in peace.

The old shopkeeper exclaimed, “What a stunning young lady! I’ve never seen a woman more beautiful in my life. You two must be the so-called celestial companions, no wonder you dare to traverse Jianghu. Well then, today you two can drink without worry; you don’t need to pay. After all, thanks to you, I’ve made quite a fortune today.”

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to raise his cup to drink, he paused at the shopkeeper’s words. After a moment's hesitation, he still said nothing and took a hearty gulp of wine.

Su Jingcheng's eyes sparkled with subtle mirth.

The old man glanced off into the distance and sighed, looking at the young man in the blue robe. “I advise you to let your lady wear her veil properly. After all, Wang Lao’er is no longer in the estate. If anything happens, I can only help you for a moment, not throughout the journey. Are you going to wait for Wang Lao’er to return from the Great Zhuan capital before you dare to leave? Let me be straightforward; Wang Lao’er often comes here to drink, and I know his temperament best. He has always held a poor opinion of you mountain cultivators and may not even be willing to meet you.”

Su Jingcheng glanced at her senior’s expression and stifled a laugh as she explained to the old shopkeeper, “I’m just a nominal disciple; we’re not celestial companions.”

The old man curled his fingers, pointing at his own eyes. “Do you think I’m blind?”

Su Jingcheng turned to look at her senior, adopting a pitiful expression that suggested she had no choice.

Yet, Chen Ping'an appeared unfazed by this, merely turning to the old man and asking, “Why did you withdraw from Jianghu and hide among the common folk?”

People continuously gathered in the streets, whispering and pointing at the tavern.

The old man laughed. “Naturally, I couldn’t survive in Jianghu, so I packed my things and left. You mountain people truly are oblivious to the sufferings of the common folk.”

Chen Ping'an asked again, “If I were a frail scholar who hadn’t encountered you in the tavern, what would happen today? Would I rise in anger and get beaten half to death, or would I endure humiliation and be bullied?”

The old man leaned on the counter, took a sip of wine, scratched his head, and lightly set down his cup. “I would endure; as long as I’m alive, there will always be opportunities to make up for it elsewhere, right?”

Chen Ping'an burst into laughter, raising his cup and downing it in one go.

The old man continued to sip his drink slowly. “However, that is ultimately wrong.”

Before long, rooftops nearby were filled with spectators.

The legendary Sword Immortal was a sight worth seeing, a tale to be told for a lifetime.

Yet despite the throngs of onlookers, no one dared to take a few steps closer to provoke trouble. Though Lu Dayong was calling for friends, he remained cautious, reveling in the fact that he had encountered a Sword Immortal, splattering the details with enthusiasm, claiming that the flying sword had hovered less than an inch from his forehead. It was truly a close call, a matter of life and death.

After finishing his drink, Chen Ping'an, feeling the senior’s politeness, did not intend to settle the bill.

He stood up, cupped his fists, and quietly said, “I pay my respects to Master Wang Dun.”

The old man nodded with a smile. “I knew you had good eyes. Why not ask why I enjoy pretending to be an old man selling wine?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head.

The old man chuckled. “To be ranked in the top ten but at the bottom, why not seek some peace, drown my sorrows in drink? Should I be constantly congratulated and smile and say how lucky I was?”

Su Jingcheng quickly stood up, bowing deeply to the old master Wang Dun, whom she admired for a long time.

The old man waved his hand. “While your man appears to be quite good, you must also cultivate diligently. There aren’t many good men in this world. When trouble arises, they love to blame you as the source of calamity.”

Su Jingcheng turned to look at her senior.

Chen Ping'an smiled. “I have made progress in my cultivation; I am not as I once was.”

However, he glanced at the veil sitting on the table.

Su Jingcheng hastily put it back on.

Suddenly, Wang Dun said, “You two wouldn’t be that foreign Sword Immortal and Su Jingcheng, would you? I heard that because of that jade lady from the Su family, the ninth-ranked Xiao Shuye died at the hands of a foreign Sword Immortal, and his head was even brought back to Qingci Kingdom. If I hadn’t been scraping together funds to buy a copy of the Mountain and Water Gazette, I would have suffered a great loss.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled. “You have good insight, Senior.”

Wang Dun exclaimed, “Ah! You have such keen eyes! Come, come, come, don’t rush to leave. I, Wang Dun, have long admired mountain cultivators. It’s an honor to meet you!”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 614: A Sip of Wine in the Jianghu

Sui Jingcheng felt a bit out of place.

In his memory, Wang Dun was the first martial artist since the founding of the Wuling Kingdom, known as a grandmaster capable of defeating anyone in the Jianghu with a single hand. His reputation was esteemed throughout the realm, praised by both the martial artists of the Jianghu and the literati of the scholarly community. They described him as a graceful elder in a blue robe, proficient in music, chess, painting, and calligraphy, with skills that had reached an extraordinary level. Moreover, he was known for his patriotism and concern for the people. Once, clad in his blue robe at the border, he bravely intercepted an enemy cavalry unit attempting to invade, buying enough time for the Wuling Kingdom's border troops to prepare their defenses…

Chen Ping’an took the lead and sat down, followed by Sui Jingcheng. 

Wang Dun stood up again, walking over to the counter to fetch three jars of wine—one for each person. With a grand air, he declared, “This is on me.”

As he placed the wine jar in front of Sui Jingcheng, he whispered, “The daughter of the old minister Sui Xinyu, right? She's quite a beauty, renowned alongside the four great beauties, each one unique in her own right. She’s brought honor to the women of our Wuling Kingdom, much more deserving of an imperial plaque than this old martial artist. But I must say, the sword immortal you've chosen, whether as a master or a husband, seems a bit stingy, only willing to share a bowl of wine with you.”

Sui Jingcheng glanced at Chen Ping’an across the table, but instead of replying, he removed the mud seal and poured wine into a large white bowl. He chuckled at the self-proclaimed old man, “Wang Zhuangzhu…”

Wang Dun immediately frowned and waved his hand, “Not old, not old. A man may grow old, but the heart remains youthful. Just call me Wang Zhuangzhu, or feel free to call me Wang Dun.”

Sui Jingcheng nodded, “Wang Zhuangzhu, the swordmaster Xiao Shuye of the Qingci Kingdom is already dead.”

Wang Dun sighed, recognizing the implication behind this “jade girl” from the Sui family. He took a sip from his wine bowl and said, “But am I not still at the bottom? Anyone from the Great Seal Dynasty can easily best me.”

Sui Jingcheng felt he had nothing left to say.

Wang Dun turned his gaze toward the young man in the blue robe, who was Chen Ping’an, the sword immortal frequently mentioned in the recent mountain and river reports. The earliest accounts stated that he had boarded a ferry to Chunlu Garden, where he chose to fight with his fists, defeating a martial artist from the Great Observation Dynasty. Later, the sword immortal Liu Zhiqing of the Jinwu Palace reportedly cleaved through the thunderclouds guarding the Jinwu Palace with a single sword strike, and subsequently, two supposed enemies ended up sharing tea at Yuying Cliff in Chunlu Garden, becoming friends instead. Now, he had beheaded Xiao Shuye within the borders of the Wuling Kingdom.

Wang Dun asked, “This sword immortal from a foreign land, he won’t decide to kill me just because I mentioned he’s not generous, right?”

Chen Ping’an chuckled helplessly, “Of course not.”

Wang Dun raised his wine bowl, and Chen Ping’an followed suit, gently clinking their bowls together. After drinking, Wang Dun quietly asked, “How old are you?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “About three hundred years.”

Wang Dun set down his wine bowl, stroking his chest, “That’s a bit comforting. Otherwise, I’d feel like I’ve lived too long for a dog.”

Sui Jingcheng smiled faintly.

Though he felt that this Wang Dun was nothing like the elder he had imagined, it was somehow more pleasant to drink with this old master of the Scouring Mountain Villa.

Wang Dun lowered his voice and asked, “Did you really just use fists to knock that Tiecangfu’s Liao off the ferry?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “I may have gotten a bit overconfident; it was quite perilous.”

Wang Dun laughed and asked, “Then shall we spar a little? Just a friendly exchange, nothing serious. Don’t worry, I just had a few drinks and am a little eager to meet a true master.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head.

Wang Dun insisted, “You refuse to engage in something so trivial after I’ve treated you to two jars of wine?”

Seeing that Chen Ping’an showed no signs of changing his mind, Wang Dun added, “Then I’ll beg you?”

Chen Ping’an pondered for a moment and nodded, “As per Wang Zhuangzhu's suggestion, we’ll use fists, and keep it light.”

Wang Dun stood up, looking around as if he picked out a nearby table. With a light slap, the four legs of the table turned to dust, falling silently to the ground.

Chen Ping’an said, “If it seems like we’re putting on a show, we can just move this table.”

Wang Dun was momentarily taken aback. “I actually wanted to do that, but I didn't want you, the sword immortal, to feel embarrassed.”

Both men stepped onto the table at the same time.

Sui Jingcheng thought about getting up to leave the tavern, but Chen Ping’an gestured for her to stay seated.

Once Wang Dun stood firm, he clasped his fists and said, “Wuling Kingdom’s Scouring Mountain Villa, Wang Dun, I have a little skill in fist techniques, and I hope to receive guidance.”

Chen Ping’an returned the gesture but remained silent, extending a hand, “Please.”

It wasn’t appropriate to reveal his identity or background.

He didn’t want to call himself Chen Haoren (Good Person Chen) either.

From a distance, the onlookers were in an uproar, wondering how this wine-selling old man had become the esteemed Wang Dun. Yet, when the old man peeled away his disguise to reveal his true form, the crowd erupted in excitement; indeed, it was the legendary Wang Dun!

Wang Dun struck with the swiftness of a rainbow, exuding a fierce aura, yet there was no killing intent.

The man in the blue robe was mostly on the defensive, striking less than he received.

As the two stood facing each other, Wang Dun smiled and said, “I’ve got a general understanding now; can we loosen up a bit?”

Chen Ping’an nodded.

In the distance, martial artists watching from the rooftops and treetops felt their emotions surge. Such a peak battle, confined to a small space, was truly a rare sight in a hundred years.

Wang Dun, the first of the Wuling Kingdom, faced off against a sword immortal, daring not just to throw punches but also holding his ground.

Though the sword immortal hadn’t yet used his flying sword, just the fact that Wang Dun had put his life on the line like this for the sake of all the martial artists in Wuling Kingdom was already a tremendous honor!

Those warriors watching from afar, lacking real martial arts masters among them and being too far from the tavern, couldn’t compare to Sui Jingcheng, who had a clearer view.

For instance, she saw the moment Wang Dun intended to conclude their spar, when he suddenly increased his pace, stepping forward and twisting his wrist. He deflected Wang Dun's punch, continuing forward to strike at Wang Dun's face, likely intending to send him crashing off the table. Unexpectedly, Wang Dun quickly signaled, and the elder nodded gently. Wang Dun, who had been slightly slower, connected his punch almost simultaneously with the elder’s palm. Both were pushed back two steps, landing gracefully at the edge of the table.

Sui Jingcheng noticed Wang Dun start signaling again, and the blue-robed elder also began to gesture. Confused, she felt as if they were negotiating a deal. However, despite the bargaining, their strikes only grew faster, each exchange nearly equal, with neither side gaining the upper hand. To outsiders, it was a masterful battle without a clear victor.

Eventually, it seemed they had agreed on a "price." Each landed a punch on the other’s chest, the table beneath them cracking in two, and they both stomped their feet to stabilize, then clasped their fists.

The spar was over.

Wang Dun laughed heartily, “I never thought a sword immortal would have such excellent fist techniques!”

The other replied cheerfully, “Your intent is much heavier and more refined. I’ll definitely return to the Scouring Mountain Villa in five to ten years to spar with you again, Wang Dun.”

Sui Jingcheng rubbed her forehead, lowering her head to drink, feeling a bit embarrassed. The mutual flattery between the two made her wonder if the real Jianghu was just watered-down wine.

If someone like Hu Xinfeng or Xiao Shuye acted this way, she wouldn’t care; but seeing Wang Dun, an esteemed elder, behave so shamelessly left her feeling as if the very foundations of the Jianghu were shaken, making her reluctant to ever touch another martial arts novel.

Wang Dun walked to the tavern entrance, raised his fists high in greeting, and waved his hand, “You all can disperse now.”

Cheers and applause erupted, and the crowd gradually began to disperse.

Once Wang Dun returned to his seat, the blue-robed sword immortal had already picked up the two halves of the broken table and placed them on another nearby table.

After sitting down, Wang Dun took a sip of wine and sighed, “Since you are so accomplished, why did you seek out an old martial artist like me? Was it because of the Sui family behind this young lady? Hoping I can look after a bit after you two leave the Wuling Kingdom for the mountains?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “I have no such request. I just wanted to make an appearance here to remind some people in the shadows that if they plan to act against the Sui family, they should weigh the consequences of my vengeance.”

Wang Dun nodded thoughtfully, “The deceptions among those cultivating in the mountains are really just extended Jianghu grievances; fundamentally, there isn’t much difference. It’s all rather meaningless. However, you, as a young sword cultivator, don’t seem like the kind of celestial being I’ve encountered before, so I don’t feel like it’s a waste to treat you to some wine. Am I being too presumptuous?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “For martial artists, the most important thing is to stay grounded. There are no shortcuts. If you don’t set your sights high or look far, how can you ever reach the peak step by step?”

Though he sold wine, Wang Dun didn’t seem to have much of a taste for it. He sipped slowly, never indulging too much. He lamented, “This tavern can’t remain open any longer. Many sincere words from Jianghu people can no longer be heard.”

Chen Ping’an asked with a grin, “Wang Zhuangzhu, do you dislike hearing good things that much?”

Wang Dun pouted, “I do enjoy hearing them. When I was younger, I particularly loved to hear them. Now, I enjoy them even more. But if I only hear sweet words and not enough sincere or harsh truths, I fear I might float off into the cloud sea. And if I float away without the powers of a celestial being, wouldn’t I just fall to my death?”

Chen Ping’an glanced at the sky.

Wang Dun smiled and asked, “According to our prior agreement, besides a dozen jars of good wine, what else do you plan to offer from the Scouring Mountain Villa?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Two swift horses and the address of a celestial ferry in the Green Oriole Kingdom.”

Wang Dun looked puzzled, “Just that?”

Chen Ping’an said, “That’s quite enough.”

Wang Dun pointed toward the counter, “The wine kept at the bottom is the most fragrant; sword immortal, feel free to take as much as you like.”

Chen Ping’an stood up and walked over to the counter, beginning to pour wine into his sword-raising gourd.

He opened jar after jar.

As five jars of fine wine were uncovered, Wang Dun could no longer sit still. Leaning over the counter, he softly urged, “On the Jianghu road, drinking too much can lead to trouble; just a little will do.”

The young blue-robed sword immortal, with his back to Wang Dun, continued pouring wine without pausing, “No problem, I’ll just fill up my gourd; I can always save some for later.”

Wang Dun hesitated and reminded, “I could change my face and continue selling wine elsewhere.”

The young sword immortal raised his head and grinned, “Then I’ll wish Wang Zhuangzhu great success and prosperity in your new venture.”

Seeing he was not dissuaded, Wang Dun continued, “The old wine down there is too strong. It’s called Thin Plum Wine, but it’s actually the old cellar wine from our Scouring Mountain Villa. Most Jianghu people who come here wouldn’t know the name, and even if they could afford it, they wouldn’t dare drink more than a couple of bowls due to its overwhelming potency, which is why it’s called ‘two bowls swaying’ or ‘three bowls down.’ You might want to mix it with some regular wine for better taste.”

The young man shook his head, “It’s fine; drinking wine isn’t like drinking tea. There’s no need to fuss over the aftertaste; the goal is to get drunk—it’s only natural.”

Wang Dun couldn’t hold back any longer, “Now that our villa is bustling with guests, officials, Jianghu friends, and literary figures, I can’t afford to treat the thirty jars of Thin Plum Wine as expendable. I came here to find some peace and wanted to keep at least a few jars of it. Don’t you have any sympathy?”

The young man had already opened the last jar of Thin Plum Wine, exclaiming with regret, “Why didn’t you say so earlier? Once this seal is broken, the aroma can’t be hidden. We’ve already drunk enough at the table, or else I could have tasted this Thin Plum Wine. If I don’t pour it into my gourd now, it would be a real shame. Since you, Wang Zhuangzhu, want to keep a jar for yourself while acting stingy by only wishing to share a bowl with me, I’ll let you keep this jar.”

Wang Dun waved his hand and chuckled, “Not at all! Just pour; I, Wang Dun, am not that kind of person. Good wine gifted to a sword immortal while storing wine in the sword-raising gourd—now that’s a wonderful thing!”

Thus, in the end, not a single jar of Thin Plum Wine was left.

Turning around, Wang Dun seemed to gaze at the departing daughters, feeling a bit melancholic and unwilling to look back.

Wang Dun sighed and asked, “When are you leaving? It's not that I don’t want to be a warm host, but it’s best if the Scouring Mountain Villa is avoided; it’s mostly trivial socializing.”

Then Wang Dun provided the detailed address of the celestial ferry in the Green Oriole Kingdom.

Chen Ping’an circled around the counter, smiling, “Then I’ll trouble you, Wang Zhuangzhu, to have two horses brought over. We won’t be staying overnight in this small town; we’ll set off at once.”

Wang Dun waved, calling over a disciple from the villa who had rushed over after hearing the news. This middle-aged swordsman, with a refined appearance like jade, had learned Wang Dun’s sword techniques and was one of his most esteemed disciples, ranking among the top three sword masters in Wuling Kingdom.

After meeting Chen Ping’an, he followed his master’s orders and before leaving the tavern, he did not forget to salute the blue-robed sword immortal, “Scouring Mountain Villa disciple Wang Jingshan, greeting the sword immortal. If the sword immortal passes by the villa again, I hope you’ll instruct your junior in swordsmanship.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and nodded, “Of course.”

Wang Dun chuckled, “What sword techniques are there to teach? The moment the flying sword comes out, Wang Jingshan will lose. Just say you want to see the sword immortal’s true artifact; there’s no need to beat around the bush.”

Wang Jingshan, clearly familiar with his master’s temperament, didn’t feel awkward at all. He smiled as he took his leave.

Before long, Wang Jingshan returned from the villa with two fine steeds. Along with him were two younger riders, a brother and sister who were Wang Jingshan’s junior disciples.

The three of them, along with the five horses, arrived at a county town not far from the Scouring Mountain Villa.

Generally, the other disciples of the villa didn’t dare to disturb their master in the tavern to catch a glimpse of the legendary sword immortal; only these two junior disciples, who were the master’s favorites, could muster the courage to tag along.

Wang Dun and the two outsiders didn’t linger in the tavern, instead standing at the entrance of the nearby inn.

There were no formalities or small talk; Chen Ping’an and Sui Jingcheng mounted their horses and rode away.

The youth, who carried a sword like Wang Jingshan, clenched his fists in excitement, “As expected of the sword immortal from the books!”

Wang Dun laughed and asked, “Which dog’s eyes saw that?”

The boy was not afraid of his master at all and replied, flexing his fingers, “I saw it clearly!”

This gesture was evidently learned from his master.

The girl, wielding a saber, looked unconvinced, “I didn’t see anything remarkable.”

The boy scoffed, “You’re learning the saber; unlike me, you naturally can’t sense the boundless sword intent emanating from that sword immortal. To say it might scare you, just a glance was immensely beneficial. Next time we spar, even if I only borrow a sliver of the sword immortal’s intent, you’d be sure to lose!”

Wang Dun slapped the boy on the head, “You silly child, why didn’t you say any of this while the sword immortal was here?”

The boy replied earnestly, “The sword immortal’s aura was too overwhelming; I couldn’t speak under the pressure of that immense sword intent!”

Wang Dun slapped him again, causing the boy’s head to wobble, “Get lost.”

The boy swaggered off, turning back to say, “On the way here, I heard that Hu Dayong has encountered the sword immortal’s flying sword. I’ll go ask him about it. If I’m lucky enough to gain a glimpse of the true essence of the flying sword, haha, don’t say it’s the junior sister, even you, Wang Jingshan, will no longer be my match. For me, that’s a joyous occasion, but for you, it’s truly sad and lamentable.”

After saying this, the boy dashed off.

Wang Jingshan smiled, “Master, where did this little disciple pick up this bad habit?”

Wang Dun tried to distance himself from the situation, randomly pointing fingers, “It’s probably from your senior sister.”

Wang Dun’s eldest disciple, Fu Liutai, was also among the top three sword masters in Wuling Kingdom and had excellent swordsmanship. However, a few years ago, she married and completely withdrew from the Jianghu, choosing to focus on family life. Her husband was not a heroic figure from the Jianghu nor a noble scion but an ordinary man of considerable means, even younger than her by seven or eight years. Strangely, neither Wang Dun nor any of Fu Liutai’s fellow disciples found this unusual; even the gossip from the Jianghu was disregarded. In earlier years, when Wang Dun was absent from the villa, it was Fu Liutai teaching martial arts, and even though Wang Jingshan was older than her, he still held great respect for her.

Thus, the girl felt somewhat indignant and complained, “Master, you can’t just abandon your senior sister now that she’s not here; that’s too lacking in Jianghu righteousness.”

Wang Dun ignored her, leading the two disciples back to the tavern.

After closing the tavern, they naturally needed to move elsewhere.

Wang Dun sat by a table as Wang Jingshan seized the opportunity to report on the villa’s recent happenings: the state of finances, social dealings, the suitability of hanging the emperor’s plaque, and the selection of auspicious days while mentioning which sect’s hero had sent a nameplate and gifts, yet hadn’t stayed overnight at the villa. He also recounted who had stayed at the villa and shared grievances with Wang Jingshan, who needed help with messages to Wang Dun, and which Jianghu elder’s birthday banquet required Wang Dun to send someone to pay respects. There was even a letter personally sent from a minister’s aide requiring the villa to dispatch personnel to help resolve a mysterious case in the capital city…

Wang Dun poured wine from the jar into a large white bowl, sipping it little by little. Most of the matters Wang Jingshan had already decided on were met with nods of acceptance from the elder. If he felt something wasn’t adequately secure, he’d offer a few words of guidance, detailing various important matters he deemed crucial, and Wang Jingshan took note of each.

The girl with the saber yawned while listening, not daring to ask for wine, instead leaning on the table, gazing at the street outside the inn, secretly wondering what the woman with the veil looked like. Would she be a great beauty? Once the veil was removed, would she be just ordinary and fail to impress? Yet the girl felt a bit disappointed. The sword immortal she had thought she wouldn’t have a chance to meet turned out to be astonishingly young, yet did not seem to fit the image of a sword immortal she had in mind.

Wang Jingshan spent nearly half an hour relaying all the bustling matters of the villa.

Wang Jingshan did not drink and was extremely devoted to swordsmanship, avoiding women and maintaining a vegetarian diet. However, after his senior sister Fu Liutai withdrew from the Jianghu, he managed the villa’s affairs alongside an elderly steward, with the former handling external matters and the latter internal. In reality, the elderly steward had aged and had long suffered from many ailments from his time in the Jianghu, becoming increasingly drained. Thus, Wang Jingshan bore most of the responsibilities, especially after his master Wang Dun’s reputation soared, causing the steward to become flustered and requiring Wang Jingshan to step in to manage relations. After all, even those of some renown in the Jianghu would carefully measure the identity and cultivation of the disciples responsible for hosting them at the Scouring Mountain Villa. If Wang Jingshan handled it, it would reflect well; if it were the least gifted disciple, Lu Zhuo, in charge, it would raise questions.

Wang Dun set down his wine bowl and said, “Jingshan, are you resentful towards your senior sister Fu? If she were still here, you wouldn’t need to shoulder all these trivial matters; perhaps you’d have reached the seventh realm by now.”

Wang Jingshan laughed, “It’s hard to say I’m completely without resentment. I don’t truly believe it, but I just feel it’s a shame senior sister found such a mediocre man; I always thought she could find someone better.”

Wang Dun chuckled, “In matters of love, if it could be rationalized, I suppose there wouldn’t be so many tragic romances in novels.”

This topic was one Wang Jingshan rarely involved himself in.

In fact, even though he didn’t particularly like the man who occasionally accompanied Fu Liutai in the villa, he was always polite and respectful. Not only that, but he also tried to restrain his junior disciples, fearing they might inadvertently reveal their feelings; in the end, it would be Fu Liutai who found herself in a difficult position.

Wang Dun paused for a moment, feeling somewhat sentimental. “I feel a bit guilty for delaying your sword training, but to speak frankly, seeing you bustling about and busy, it brings me comfort. It makes me feel that taking you as a disciple and teaching you swordsmanship was a fulfilling thing. But regardless, I still must say something from the heart.”

Wang Jingshan sat upright, “Master, please speak; I’m listening.”

Wang Dun smiled gently and said, “Jingshan, if one day you feel tired, truly weary of these mundane villa affairs, and want to take a sword and wander the Jianghu, don’t feel guilty about it—not at all. Just come find me, bring a jar of good wine, and I’ll send you off after a drink. Whenever you want to return home, just come back. Rest for a while and then venture out again; it should be so, yes, it should.”

Wang Jingshan responded, “Understood.”

The girl with the saber had slightly misty eyes at the next table.

The thought of both her senior sister being away from the villa and her senior brother Wang Jingshan leaving as well was disheartening.

But more than that, the girl felt saddened by how her master had aged.

Wang Jingshan suddenly said, “Master, then I’ll head out to wander the Jianghu now?”

Wang Dun was taken aback, then smiled, “Wait, wait! I’ve had a bit too much to drink today and am just talking drunken nonsense. Don’t take it to heart; even if you do, it should be later. The villa still needs you to hold the fort…”

The girl rolled her eyes and turned away, resting her head on the table.

This master, who never showed an ounce of the demeanor of a grandmaster in front of his own people, was really annoying.

Yet, both Fu Liutai and Wang Jingshan were renowned figures in the Jianghu, while their master was merely lazily sitting at the Scouring Mountain Villa.

She and that little junior disciple believed this wholeheartedly.

Because both Fu Liutai and Wang Jingshan had once walked the Jianghu alongside their master.

Their master had clashed with the practitioners of the mountains several times throughout his life, even facing life-threatening battles.

The reasons for their master’s actions, as recounted by both Fu Liutai and Wang Jingshan, were identical: their master loved to meddle.

But for some reason, when it came to this statement, neither Fu Liutai nor Wang Jingshan ever expressed any resentment toward their master. On the contrary, their eyes sparkled with admiration.

The boy with the sword rushed into the tavern, plopping down on the long bench next to his master Wang Dun.

In terms of respect for their master, this was something that only this boy could do, without any reservations.

Wang Dun asked with a laugh, “So, did you gain anything?”

The boy lamented, “That Hu Dayong exaggerated so much, spraying my face with spit. I had to be careful to avoid his spittle attacks, and he kept repeating the same few sentences. I’m not a real celestial being; I couldn’t figure out much of the true essence of the flying sword. So Wang Shixiong’s luck is better than Junior Sister’s; otherwise, I’d already be the best among your disciples.”

Wang Jingshan smiled, “Should I go thank Hu Daxia for holding back?”

The boy waved his hand, “No need; my swordsmanship exceeds Shixiong’s, not today then tomorrow.”

Wang Jingshan didn’t respond.

Though this little disciple showed no decorum, when it came to practicing swordsmanship, he was the most disciplined disciple of the Scouring Mountain Villa.

That was enough.

Wang Dun scanned his three disciples, each with their distinct personalities yet all good-hearted. Feeling that today he could drink a bit more, he stood up and walked over to the counter, only to be stunned.

Why were there three unfamiliar jars of wine added?

Opening one jar, the fragrant aroma wafted through the air, catching the attention of all three disciples.

Wang Dun laughed heartily and called the girl over to sit with them, insisting even Wang Jingshan join in to taste the wine of the celestial beings from the mountains. He poured varying depths of the celestial brew into each of their bowls.

The boy took a sip and exclaimed, “Damn, this wine is strong! It’s far better than our villa’s Thin Plum Wine! No wonder it’s a gift from the sword immortal; it’s extraordinary!”

Wang Jingshan also took a sip, finding it indeed distinct, but still reluctant to drink much.

The girl tried a sip, but didn’t find it agreeable, thinking, what wine in the world could be good to drink?

Wang Dun smiled and asked the boy, “As a swordsman, is it regrettable that your master isn’t a sword immortal?”

The boy replied boldly after a sip of celestial brew, “But I’m not a sword immortal either!”

Wang Dun nodded with a smile, his hand, which had been ready to strike the boy’s head, instead gently patted the boy’s head, his face filled with warmth, “At least you’re a good-hearted child.”

The boy nodded vigorously and, taking advantage of Wang Dun’s lowered head while drinking, turned to the girl and winked, as if to ask if he was clever or impressive for escaping a beating and avoiding a thrashing.

The girl began to complain to her master.

Wang Jingshan added fuel to the fire.

The boy feigned ignorance and acted foolish.

Wang Dun said nothing, simply pouring the wine from the bowls of all three into his own white bowl and downing it in one go.

To reach the Green Oriole Kingdom, located on the eastern seaside of the North Julu Continent, one had to travel north from the Wuling Kingdom, crossing through the territories of Jingnan and Beiyan.

Neither were large kingdoms, nor were they vassals of a grand dynasty.

Jingnan was known for its many lakes and wetlands, while Beiyan was characterized by lofty mountains and steep ridges.

However, relations between Jingnan and the Wuling Kingdom had always been poor, with frequent skirmishes at the borders. Yet, in the past century, large-scale wars involving tens of thousands of border troops were rare.

The Wuling Kingdom's border troops were mostly stationed at perilous mountain passes, while Jingnan’s navy was formidable. Thus both sides found it challenging to penetrate deep into enemy territory. Should a conservative general be stationed at the border, peace would prevail, and trade would flourish. However, if a general seeking merit through small victories took command, minor skirmishes would be bound to erupt. Of course, large-scale wars would not happen; the border troops had no worries, and the emperors of both kingdoms had tacitly agreed to avoid sending overly aggressive generals to the border. Nevertheless, Jingnan's powerful external relatives had become a significant force over the years, and a young noble had requested a southern deployment, preparing a cavalry force and provoking several times. Meanwhile, the Wuling Kingdom had seen the rise of a local Confucian general skilled in military strategy, responsible for the northern defense, leading to a series of small-scale conflicts in recent years. Ten years ago, if Wang Dun hadn’t happened to travel to the border, inadvertently intercepting a cavalry unit from Jingnan attempting to invade without warning, Wuling Kingdom might have lost one or two major border towns. Of course, they could have been reclaimed, but the casualties would have been the highest in a century.

Chen Ping’an and Sui Jingcheng, riding two steeds, presented their credentials at a lightly guarded pass of the Wuling Kingdom, crossing the border. They then chose not to take the official roads of Jingnan but continued on Chen Ping’an’s planned route, opting for some mountain trails to explore and seek adventure.

However, not long after entering the territory, they stumbled upon a skirmish in a secluded path.

Two groups of scouts, each consisting of about ten riders.

The southern cavalry were scouts from the Wuling Kingdom, while the northern cavalry were elite riders from Jingnan.

Sui Jingcheng, puzzled, remarked, “It’s usually the Jingnan barbarians raiding south; why are our scouts actively entering enemy territory?”

Chen Ping’an said, “This indicates that your esteemed young Confucian general in Wuling Kingdom has grand ambitions. A young soldier rising through the ranks to a third-rank general in less than ten years is certainly not an ordinary figure.”

The two riders quickly left the path, stopping their horses amid the dense forest. After securing their mounts, Chen Ping’an and Sui Jingcheng stood atop a tree, surveying the battlefield.

Jingnan had always excelled in naval warfare, ranking just below the Great Seal Dynasty and the Southern Great Observation Dynasty. However, it lacked regular cavalry capable of engaging in battle. Over the past decade, a noble general from the external relatives had aggressively purchased warhorses from the neighboring Liang Kingdom, assembling a cavalry force of around four thousand. Unfortunately, their campaigns had yielded no victories, and when they encountered Wang Dun, the first of the Wuling Kingdom, even if they had six legs, they wouldn’t be able to catch up. Thus, they were destined to fail and reveal military secrets, leading to their retreat.

In contrast, Wuling Kingdom’s foot soldiers and cavalry had always been mediocre and could be said to be quite poor. Yet against Jingnan’s primarily naval force, they had maintained an advantage.

Therefore, as a native of the Wuling Kingdom, Sui Jingcheng believed that when the two groups of scouts met, their side’s border troops would surely emerge victorious.

However, the battlefield’s outcome turned out to be lopsided. After encountering each other, there was no room for maneuvering, and both leaders of the scouts showed no hesitation.

The two groups of scouts charged forward silently, without any cries.

In the initial exchanges of bows and arrows, both sides suffered casualties, with the Jingnan scouts slightly gaining the upper hand, managing to injure or kill five from the Wuling scouts, while the Jingnan elite cavalry suffered two dead and one injured.

They drew their blades and engaged in close combat.

As they brushed past each other, the Wuling scouts experienced even greater losses.

After exchanging battlefield positions, two Wuling scouts who had fallen injured attempted to escape the narrow path but were shot in the head and neck by several Jingnan scouts wielding crossbows.

On the other end of the battlefield, a fallen Jingnan scout met a more gruesome fate, being pierced by arrows in the face and chest, and struck down by a rider who expertly sliced his throat, blood spraying everywhere.

On the southern side, only one Wuling scout continued south on a double-mounted horse.

In truth, neither side had one rider per horse, but in the narrow fighting, as they charged through, some of their own steeds attempting to follow their riders would be shot or slashed by the opposing side.

Thus, the single Wuling scout on a double-mounted horse had secured his mount by decisively sacrificing a comrade.

Otherwise, one rider wouldn’t have been able to flee far.

The remaining Wuling scouts turned their horses, aiming simply to buy time to delay the pursuit of the enemy scouts at the cost of their lives. 

Of course, the scout who had lost his horse also took a deep breath and stood with his blade drawn.

On the battlefield, a strategy of retreating while fighting was not something a large cavalry could undertake, but the most elite scouts among them could do so. However, this would make it difficult for even that single scout to distance himself from this group of Jingnan soldiers.

Both sides were originally evenly matched; however, there was a gap in strength. After one side charged through the formation and with one Wuling scout escaping, the disparity grew even larger.

Moments later, only a field of corpses remained.

Three Jingnan scouts quietly pursued the remaining Wuling scout.

The other scouts, under the command of a young soldier, dismounted and either used light crossbows to execute the wounded enemy scouts or took turns to compete in marksmanship, the loser in a fit of anger drawing their blade to swiftly behead a fallen enemy.

The young soldier maintained a blank expression, stepping onto a fallen Wuling scout’s body, using the face of that corpse to wipe the blood from the blade in his hand.

The Wuling scout, who should have been gravely injured and dead, suddenly aimed his crossbow at an enemy approaching to claim a head. The latter had no time to dodge and instinctively raised his hands to protect his face.

The young soldier seemed to have anticipated this, not turning his head, casually tossing his blade, which precisely severed the arm of the crossbowman. The Wuling scout, whose life had just been saved, was furious, eyes wide with bloodshot anger as he stepped forward to turn the disarmed enemy into mush. Unexpectedly, the young man called out from a distance, “Don’t kill out of anger, give him a quick end; you never know, we might end up in the same position one day.”

Though the Jingnan scout’s heart burned with rage, he nodded silently and stepped forward, stabbing down at the fallen enemy’s throat, twisting his wrist to pull out the blade swiftly.

Before long, the three scouts returned, with a headless corpse draped over one of their horses.

The young soldier took the blade handed to him by a subordinate, gently placing it back in its sheath, then walked to the headless corpse, searching it for a pile of military intelligence.

Leaning against his warhorse, the young soldier carefully examined those reports, recalling something, and raised his head to order, “After you take care of your brother’s corpse, gather the enemy scouts’ bodies; bury them properly.”

One brawny scout exclaimed in lament, “Gu Biao, isn’t this dirty work better suited for the nearby stationed troops?”

The young soldier smiled, “I won’t make you do it for nothing; you can decide among yourselves who should receive the two heads I’ve collected.”

Cheers erupted.

Ultimately, this group of formidable Jingnan scouts whirled away.

In the trees along the roadside, Sui Jingcheng’s face turned pale; she had not spoken a word throughout.

Chen Ping’an asked, “Why didn’t you speak up and let me intervene to save them?”

Sui Jingcheng simply shook her head.

The two led their horses out of the dense forest, and after Chen Ping’an mounted his horse, he turned to look down the road. To his surprise, that young soldier appeared in the distance, halting his horse, and after a moment, he grinned, nodding at the blue-robed figure before turning his horse away in silence.

Sui Jingcheng asked, “Was he a Jianghu master hidden within the army?”

Chen Ping’an gently squeezed his horse’s belly, both moving forward slowly, shaking his head, “He’s only just reached the third realm; he likely achieved his current level through battlefield experience. Quite impressive.”

Sui Jingcheng looked puzzled.

For a sword immortal who casually killed Xiao Shuye, how could a mere soldier in the third realm be considered “impressive”?

Chen Ping’an said, “Most of the peak experts in the world probably walked this path step by step.”

The two rode side by side at a leisurely pace, not in a hurry, so the horses trotted gently without urgency. Sui Jingcheng curiously asked, “And the others?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “They were fortunate.”

Sui Jingcheng had no response.

Chen Ping’an added, “Some things you might not have at birth, and perhaps you’ll never have in your life. That’s just how things are; you have to accept your fate.”

Moments later, Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “But that’s okay; there are many things you can strive for on your own. If we keep fixating on things that are destined to be unattainable, then we’ll end up with nothing.”

Sui Jingcheng felt that made sense.

But when she thought of her own life circumstances, she felt somewhat guilty.

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Isn’t it a good thing to have something from birth? What’s there to feel embarrassed about?”

Sui Jingcheng, perhaps feeling benefited from his words, remained silent for a moment before turning to smile, “Senior, may I speak a few heartfelt words?”

Chen Ping’an said, “Shut up.”

Behind the veil, Sui Jingcheng’s eyes glimmered with resentment as she pursed her lips.

The two riders continued their journey north.

After witnessing the brutal clash of the narrow road, they later saw children chasing yellow butterflies, flying into fields of canola flowers, lost amidst the beauty.

They also encountered a group of village children chasing the shadows of the two riders, making a ruckus.

At the summit of a renowned mountain, they inadvertently met a practitioner, who was hovering in the wind near an ancient pine tree with a twisted posture, spreading out rice paper and slowly painting. Upon seeing them, he only smiled and nodded in greeting, then resumed his painting of the ancient pine, quietly departing into the night.

Sui Jingcheng gazed far at the retreating figure of the Qi cultivator.

Chen Ping’an began to practice his stances.

After Sui Jingcheng withdrew her gaze, she cautiously asked, “Senior, if I attain mastery in cultivation, will I be able to save people during such border skirmishes?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Of course you can. But you must consider whether you can bear the unimaginable consequences. For example, if you rescue that scout, he returns to the Wuling Kingdom, and that intelligence successfully reaches the border general. It might be set aside and become useless, leading to provocations at the border and causing hundreds or thousands of casualties. Or, it could escalate to a full-blown war, devastating the land, resulting in countless deaths and widespread suffering.”

Sui Jingcheng fell silent, her heart heavy.

Chen Ping’an continued his stance practice, gradually saying, “Thus, cultivators don’t simply distance themselves from the world out of coldness or indifference. You may not understand these things now, and that’s fine; I only began to comprehend it after truly cultivating and trying to view the human world from a different perspective. Earlier, when we replayed the events at the peak of Zhenru, do you recall? In that game, whom did you think should be saved? Who should be helped? Was it Lin Shu, the foolishly loyal former emperor? Or the scholar who had plotted his own path to survival? Or those who perished in the great hall of Zhenru? It seems the last group should be the first to be saved, but have you considered what would happen to Lin Shu then? What about the scholar’s plans for restoring his country? Further afield, what of the Emperor of the Golden Door Kingdom and the former emperor? Regardless of their virtues or vices, who contributed more to the state and its people? Do you want to know? Those Jianghu people who knew the truth yet willingly went to their deaths for that former prince—what about them? If you play the hero, filled with righteous fervor, and strike down with your sword, does that feel gratifying?”

Sui Jingcheng nodded slightly, sitting cross-legged on the cliff edge, the gentle wind brushing her face. She removed the veil, her dark hair swirling in the breeze.

Chen Ping’an approached her but did not sit down. “Being a good person isn’t about how I feel, and doing good deeds isn’t about what I believe. So, being a cultivator isn’t a bad thing; it allows one to see and understand more.”

Chen Ping’an took out the travel staff he hadn’t shown in a long time, holding it with both hands and giving it a gentle shake. “However, as more cultivators arise, it can lead to some troubles because the pursuit of absolute freedom will create more strong individuals. Even a light touch from them can create upheaval in the mortal realm. Sui Jingcheng, let me ask you, if a chair has been sat on for a long time, will it shake?”

Sui Jingcheng thought for a moment, “It should… definitely?”

Chen Ping’an looked away, “Have you never seen a chair that shakes in your life?”

Sui Jingcheng remained silent, blinking her eyes with an innocent expression.

Chen Ping’an sighed, “Have you really never seen one?”

Sui Jingcheng felt a bit embarrassed.

The Sui family was one of the wealthiest in the Wuling Kingdom.

Chen Ping’an rubbed his chin and laughed, “How am I supposed to continue this conversation?”

So he put away the travel staff and resumed his stance practice.

Sui Jingcheng felt somewhat disappointed but also inexplicably happy.

She couldn't quite understand why, but what did it matter? After all, the celestial ferry in the Green Oriole Kingdom was still a long way off, and they weren’t in a rush.

Suddenly, she turned to smile and asked, “Senior, I want to drink wine!”

He replied, “If you want to buy it, we can negotiate; otherwise, it’s not worth discussing.”

She laughed, “I’ll buy it no matter how expensive it is!”

In response, he shook his head, “You clearly seem like someone who owes money; it’s not worth discussing.”

Sui Jingcheng sighed, leaning back and falling to the ground, the starry sky above her like a treasure mosaic, hanging over the myriad of homes below.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 615: The Great Trends of the World

In the Kingdom of Jingnan, where rivers crisscrossed, two riders pressed on day and night.

However, traveling from Jingnan to the Kingdom of Beiyan had become troublesome. Recently, a series of skirmishes had erupted at the border, instigated by Beiyan. Hundreds to a thousand light cavalry had stormed across the border, wreaking havoc, while Jingnan's northern regions lacked the cavalry to confront them in open battle. As a result, they could only retreat to their cities. Thus, the border passes between the two nations had been sealed, and under such circumstances, any martial artist traveling through would become an easy target.

Nevertheless, the two riders decided to take the mountain trails at the border to cross over.

Recalling the earlier infiltration of Jingnan by scouts from the Wuling Kingdom, Sui Jingcheng seemed to have an epiphany.

That evening, as they rode up a hillside, they spotted a village built along the river, ablaze with light. Just as Sui Jingcheng expected his senior to observe from a distance before detouring, one rider suddenly charged down the slope, heading straight for the village. Sui Jingcheng was momentarily stunned before spurring his horse to catch up.

Upon entering the village, the scene was akin to a hell on earth—everywhere lay the tortured corpses of the slain. Most women were left nearly bare, and many young men had suffered fatal wounds from spears, bleeding out as they struggled to crawl, leaving a trail of blood. There were countless severed limbs, and many children met an especially tragic fate.

Sui Jingcheng dismounted and began to gag on the ground.

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes and listened intently. After a moment, he said, “There are no survivors left.”

Sui Jingcheng hardly registered the words, feeling as if his bile was about to rise.

Chen Ping'an crouched down, picked up some blood-soaked earth, gently kneaded it, then tossed it aside. Standing up, he scanned the surroundings, then leaped onto a roof, observing the footprints and hoofprints around him. His gaze gradually extended far away. Finally, after landing back on the ground, he took out the sword-sheathing gourd and handed it to Sui Jingcheng, along with the reins of his horse. “We’ll follow them. We can catch up. Remember to protect yourself. Staying here alone might not be safe. Try to keep up with me; if your horse tires, switch mounts.”

With that, Chen Ping'an shot off.

Sui Jingcheng mounted again, forcing himself to suppress the dizziness, and galloped after him.

Fortunately, the figure in the green robe didn’t push too hard, still taking care of Sui Jingcheng’s steed’s endurance.

About half an hour later, they heard the sound of hooves near a shallow stream in a valley.

The senior didn’t slow down. “We’ve caught up. From here on, don’t worry about exhausting the horses; just keep up with me, and try to stay within two hundred paces. But be careful; no one knows what might happen.”

Sui Jingcheng leaped onto another horse, with the sword-sheathing gourd tied around his waist, and began to charge forward.

The border troops had strict rules regarding the care of their mounts, ensuring they were well-fed and their noses clean. 

In this half-path, half-stream valley, the light cavalry must have lingered a bit, having just set out not long ago.

As the light cavalry’s rear detachment turned their heads, one soldier spotted the figure in the flying green robe and momentarily froze before shouting, “Martial artist ambush!”

The figure in green moved like smoke, and the trained elite cavalry barely had time to turn their horses and ready their bows before two swords were unsheathed from their waists for reasons unknown, and in an instant, two heads flew high into the air, their headless bodies collapsing onto their steeds.

The figure in green did not land on the ground but instead bent low, weaving seamlessly atop the warhorse, wielding both swords.

In just a few blinks, over twenty riders fell, each with a single stroke—either cleaved in half or split down the middle.

The Beiyan elite cavalry quickly scattered, abandoning their bows to draw their swords; some began pulling armor from their packs to don.

A leader-like figure among the cavalry rushed forward, brandishing a long spear and aimed it at the figure in green. The latter was just about to stab a nearby rider in the neck with the tip of his sword, when he pulled back, using the momentum to lean away and kill another rider behind him, just as the long spear was perfectly timed to intercept him.

Sui Jingcheng almost shouted a warning but quickly bit his tongue.

In the next moment, Sui Jingcheng could only watch as the figure in green somehow managed to twist in the air, charging forward toward the spear, allowing its tip to pierce his chest. Then, with a swift motion, he lunged forward, and the cavalry leader bellowed in anger. Despite his palm being punctured and bloodied, he refused to let go. Yet, the spear slid from his grasp, the friction tearing at his palm, revealing white bone. The cavalry leader realized the danger and finally had to abandon the ancestral spear, but in an instant, the figure in green was already crouching atop his horse, and the next moment, a sword pierced through his neck, instantly penetrating.

The leader shot upright, the right hand still holding the sword, but it was already too late. The figure in green lifted the sword high, dragging the leader off his horse.

On the warhorse, the figure in green wielded a standard-issue war sword from the Beiyan cavalry, which had pierced through the leader’s neck, revealing a sharp glimmer. The speed of the strike was so quick that not a drop of blood stained the blade.

Chen Ping'an suddenly retracted his sword, and the leader's body fell from the horse, crashing onto the ground.

Seizing the opportunity, the Beiyan cavalry launched a volley of arrows.

Chen Ping'an, holding his swords, felt the green robe tremble, and all the arrows shattered mid-air.

The warhorse beneath him suddenly fell, its leg broken, and the figure in green was almost imperceptible. Only two brilliant flashes of sword light erupted, chaotic yet lethal, akin to the flames of that village, leaving death in its wake.

Two hundred Beiyan elite riders, two hundred incomplete corpses.

Standing on the back of a warhorse, Chen Ping'an tossed both swords to the ground and surveyed the surroundings. “You’ve followed us all this way, and only now do you reveal yourselves?”

From the knee-deep stream, a head emerged, covered by a white mask, ripples forming around it. Finally, a figure in black robes stood there, his voice smooth as it seeped from the edges of the mask. “What impressive swordsmanship.”

At the same time, several assassins in black garb and white masks floated down from the cliffs.

Among them was a graceful woman, one hand holding a powder box, delicately applying powder to her fair neck.

Another had both hands hidden in her large sleeves.

One crouched beside the cavalry leader’s body, fingers pressing against the center of his forehead.

A burly figure, like a small mountain, bore a large bow on his back.

The black-robed figure standing on the water smiled and said, “Let’s get to work and finish this quickly. Don’t delay the sword immortal on his journey to the netherworld.”

The assassin applying powder purred, “Got it, got it.”

She tucked the powder box into her sleeve, flicked her wrists, revealing two short blades, glimmering with ancient rune patterns.

As she slowly advanced, two identical women appeared on either side, followed by two more, seemingly endless.

A hundred short-blade wielding women surged from all directions toward the young man in green.

However, only one diverged from the battlefield, darting like a dragonfly skimming water, continually changing her trajectory toward Sui Jingcheng, only to be met with a flash of sword light from the gourd, piercing her skull. With a loud thud, her body transformed into a puff of blue smoke.

That was the true battlefield.

One by one, the women were crushed into blue smoke.

Yet each woman and each blade was incredibly sharp, not mere illusions. Furthermore, they seemed to be filled with hidden weapons, making them hard to defend against.

Had it not been for the fact that he was a rugged and durable Gold Body realm martial artist, an ordinary Sixth Realm martial artist would have likely died dozens of times from just this.

Such is the nature of celestial techniques; even if she was merely a military practitioner at the Sea Observation realm, using numbers to prevail was her innate advantage against martial artists.

In this vast world, there is no absolute.

The figure in green suddenly vanished, appearing before a woman on the edge of the battlefield, delivering a punch that pierced her heart.

All the women abruptly halted, and she smiled wretchedly. “How did you know I was the real one? The powder box wasn’t in my sleeve…”

Chen Ping'an frowned.

In the next moment, the woman broke into a giggle, transforming into a gust of blue smoke. All the women followed suit, eventually coalescing into one, thick smoke billowing as a woman sauntered out, one hand behind her back, rubbing her heart. She smiled and said, “You found the right one, but as long as I don't get killed in one breath, I won’t die. Are you angry, sword immortal?”

With a gesture of her hand held behind her back, the man nodded. The woman’s body exploded into a cloud of blue smoke, and the other women lunged once more at the figure in green.

After a single punch.

Chen Ping'an stood in the spot where the woman had been, and nearly all the women shattered under the might of his powerful punch.

Only one woman remained, blood seeping from the cracks of her white mask as she pressed her finger heavily against it.

A short assassin crouched on the ground nodded, standing up. “Done. Relying on you was indeed ineffective; almost caused a blunder.”

The woman, clearly severely injured, retorted, “If it weren’t for my relentless delaying actions, would you have been able to draw the array?”

Sui Jingcheng drew fifteen flying swords from the sword-sheathing gourd at her waist.

The sword light shot toward the small array master’s temple.

The short assassin, who had kept her hands hidden in her sleeves, had already plucked out a golden talisman while conversing with the female assassin, smiling as she raised her fingers, the talisman hovering at her side, waiting for the flying sword to fall into the trap.

Yet, the fifteen flying swords suddenly arced away, returning to the sword-sheathing gourd.

A white rainbow shot forth from Chen Ping'an's brow.

The sword light flashed.

Unexpectedly, the other hand of the short assassin had also raised a talisman, and the flying sword initially sank into the talisman as if stuck in mud, vanishing without a trace.

The golden talisman hovered in front of the short assassin, trembling slightly. “Good thing I prepared a priceless sword-binding talisman; otherwise, I might have really died. You, sword immortal, why are you so insidious? Isn’t a sword immortal the most favored child of destruction on the mountain? Why be so scheming? How are we cultivators supposed to survive? That’s why I’m really angry.”

In reality, after the initial fifteen flying swords were trapped by the sword-binding talisman, an array of dazzling lights began to form within a radius of about thirty feet around Chen Ping'an, the lights crisscrossing like a chessboard, continuously shrinking but growing ever brighter, as if a celestial being had plucked the purest sunlight and moonlight.

The short assassin, a formation master on the mountain, smirked slightly.

This array had two major advantages: first, it caused the cultivator’s spiritual energy to stagnate; second, whether the trapped person was an armored military practitioner or a pure martial artist, no matter how sturdy their physique, they would be ensnared by the intertwining beams of light. The torment of being bound was not merely physical pain; it was akin to ordinary mortals or common cultivators being tormented by their souls ignited.

The array master cursed a few times, then pulled out a stack of yellow paper talismans, hovering them near the golden sword-binding talisman, the spiritual light drawing them together, seemingly forming another small array.

The situation was already decided.

The black-robed figure standing on the water glanced at the distribution of corpses on the battlefield, then began replaying the earlier moves of the green-robed figure in his mind.

There was a small detail he needed to confirm.

Now, it seemed they could wrap things up.

In ordinary circumstances, encountering such a skillful and murderous Golden Core sword immortal, they could only expect to die sooner or later. If a few managed to escape, it would mean the opponent had shown mercy.

However, in the fights among mountain practitioners, realm and magical treasures were naturally critical but not absolute factors. Besides, the overall combat strength in this world was never a simple matter of one plus one.

He nodded to the assassin who had been gathering souls.

The latter stood up, began to chant a formula, and silently recited.

Inside the array, the green-robed sword immortal was already trapped but suddenly stumbled, his shoulder swaying. Chen Ping'an found he could barely raise his right hand, glancing down to see twisted black threads crawling up his palm.

It felt as though his entire arm was restrained.

Chen Ping'an clenched his fist, yet he still could not shake off those dark threads.

At the same time, the burly assassin removed his large bow and drew it back like a full moon.

The black-robed figure on the river smiled. “Once you enter the temple, why hold incense in your left hand? The right hand is stained with too much blood, unsuitable for offering to the Buddha. This secret technique is not something ordinary cultivators get to see. Had it not been for the fear of unforeseen circumstances, I should have used this Buddhist divine ability against you from the start.”

An arrow, radiant and flowing with light, shot through the air.

The black-robed figure held it in his left hand, and with tremendous force, the green-robed sword immortal had no choice but to turn his head away to avoid the arrowhead. With a punch, he shattered the arrow, which fell to the ground.

The array beneath him continued to shrink, ultimately cloaking the green-robed figure in a web of countless slender beams of light.

Meanwhile, the burly man kept shooting arrows; after six shots, all were deflected by the green-robed figure's strikes. The black-robed man remained unmoving on the river, while a flash of sword light shot forth.

The man reached out with his left palm, somehow grasping the lethal flying sword.

The flying sword of a Dragon Gate realm sword cultivator was still a flying sword, and in terms of sharpness, it was not inferior to an ordinary Golden Core sword cultivator’s.

Because he had to restrain the flying sword, even a slight dodge resulted in an arrow piercing his left shoulder. The arrow shot through his shoulder, its momentum still strong, showcasing the formidable power of this celestial arrow and the remarkable strength of the archer.

With his right hand trapped by the divine ability and his left shoulder injured again, coupled with the array binding his soul, the green-robed sword immortal was utterly defenseless.

Sui Jingcheng's eyes brimmed with tears as she frantically patted the sword-sheathing gourd, shouting, “Go save your master! Even just try!”

But the gourd remained silent.

Sui Jingcheng was not afraid of death; she did not hesitate to charge forward. She knew that if she went, she would only increase her senior's peril.

She began to resent her cold and calculating nature.

Gritting her teeth, Sui Jingcheng squeezed her horse’s belly, pulled out three golden hairpins, and began to gallop forward. “At worst, I’ll die first, and maybe he won’t have to worry about me.” That way, she wouldn’t delay her senior in killing enemies and escaping.

Chen Ping'an, drenched in blood and soul tormented, flicked his left hand, casting away the nearly restrained flying sword, smiling, “Is that all? No trump cards left?”

The assassin using the Buddhist divine ability to bind the right hand of the green-robed sword immortal frowned. “Something’s off! How can someone endure this without any reaction?”

Chen Ping'an let his right arm droop, allowing the array to envelop him.

With a single step, he vanished from sight.

First, the array master.

This was something that Ma Xiaodong had repeatedly stressed after that perilous battle in the capital of the Great Sui.

The short man naturally understood his importance.

He burrowed into the earth.

The flying swords of the black-robed man and the archer shot toward the spot where the short array master stood almost simultaneously.

But the figure in green did not appear there; instead, he shifted slightly, clutching the woman’s neck in his left hand and lifting her into the air. The woman died instantly, her soul being obliterated by the overwhelming energy that surged forth.

He tossed her body toward the second arrow, then stomped his foot, shaking the ground.

With a muffled grunt, the array master broke through the earth, appearing behind the burly man. Chen Ping'an casually waved his hand, shattering the sword-binding talisman and the remaining yellow paper talismans.

Then he vanished again.

A punch pierced through the chest of the burly man clad in celestial armor.

Through the man’s heart and out his back, Chen Ping'an’s left hand grasped the array master’s face, causing his head to explode.

The black-robed figure on the river sighed, sheathing his flying sword and quickly submerging into the water.

Only the Qi cultivator capable of restraining a martial artist with his killing intent remained, collapsing to the ground, his soul scattering like wisps of blue smoke.

The flying swords, the initial and the fifteenth, surged out, swiftly shredding the blue smoke.

Chen Ping'an still let his right arm dangle, his shoulder trembling slightly, staggering as he leaped into the stream, standing where the black-robed figure had vanished, and stabbed down with a sword.

The entire stream erupted, splashing countless droplets.

Yet near the mountain peak, a figure pressed against the cliff wall suddenly leaped up, transforming into a rainbow as it darted away.

Chen Ping'an released his grip, his sword trailing a long golden line as it sped off.

He glanced around, squinting for a better view.

The initial and fifteenth flying swords returned from two openings to Chen Ping'an’s Qi field.

His gaze finally landed on a stone cliff across the way, and he walked over slowly. “Did you really think I was a three-year-old? You shouldn’t have summoned the flying sword, or else you would have truly escaped.”

From the stone wall, the black-robed figure shot out rapidly.

The two exchanged strikes with their flying swords.

Chen Ping'an protected his heart with his left hand, clutching the flying sword between his fingers, just a hair’s breadth away from his heart.

Meanwhile, both his brow and heart had already been pierced by the initial and fifteenth flying swords.

The sword that Chen Ping'an held between his fingers dimmed instantly, devoid of any sword energy or spirit.

Then he hurled it out with force.

Knowing he was doomed, the black-robed figure chose to self-destruct, shattering all his crucial energy vessels, leaving no trace behind.

Chen Ping'an flipped backward, drifting over the stream, landing on the bank, retrieving the two flying swords and punching away the chaotic ripples of energy.

The sword immortal returned.

Held in Chen Ping'an’s hand, he leaned on the sword, took a deep breath, and turned to spit out a mouthful of congealed blood.

Sui Jingcheng spurred her horse forward and then dismounted.

Chen Ping'an turned his head and said, “I’m fine.”

Sui Jingcheng blinked, and Chen Ping'an smiled. “They have no backup now.”

At this, Sui Jingcheng's eyes filled with tears as she gazed at the bloodied green-robed sword immortal. She choked out, “Wasn’t it said that there are rules in war, and rules in the martial world? Why care about these matters? If we hadn’t interfered, this great battle wouldn’t have happened…”

Chen Ping'an squatted by the water’s edge, scooping a handful of water to wash his face. The sword immortal stood beside him, gazing at the now tranquil stream flowing softly. He said calmly, “I told you, why complicate things? It all boils down to simply throwing a punch or striking with a sword.”

Sui Jingcheng crouched beside him, cradling her face in her hands as she sobbed softly.

Chen Ping'an continued, “You’re lucky. Search the bodies of those assassins and the surrounding area; see if there are any celestial treasures to be found.”

Sui Jingcheng wiped her tears and stood up, running off to scavenge for spoils.

About an incense stick’s worth of time later, the two riders left the valley, heading back toward the village.

Chen Ping'an felt a slight sway in his body; that arm had just begun to regain some feeling.

Sui Jingcheng's complexion had improved significantly, and she asked, “Senior, what are we going back to do?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “To ensure those commoners have complete corpses.”

Sui Jingcheng nodded vigorously, though she felt some guilt.

Chen Ping'an said slowly, “No need for that. Human power has its limits. Just like your father standing idly during the incident, the situation itself wasn’t wrong. No observer should be overly harsh; it’s just that some people, in a situation devoid of error, will still feel the weight of their conscience. Sui Jingcheng, I believe you can act with a clear conscience. Remember, when faced with disaster, everyone has those moments of helplessness. If you can survive, then afterward, you needn’t feel too much guilt; otherwise, your heart will eventually shatter.”

Sui Jingcheng hesitated, turning her head to look. “Senior, although I’ve gained a bit, I’ve also suffered such serious injuries. Won’t you regret it?”

Chen Ping'an raised his left hand, pointing behind him. “That’s a question you should ask them.”

Sui Jingcheng didn’t follow the green-robed sword immortal's finger to look; she merely gazed at him blankly.

On the village’s side.

From dusk to deep night, then to dawn.

The two riders gradually left, continuing northward.

Sui Jingcheng remained silent for a long while, and when she saw her senior taking out the sword-sheathing gourd to drink, she finally asked, “Senior, why have you been so willing to teach me so much on this journey?”

Chen Ping'an, however, replied off-topic, “What do you think of the old man Wang Dun, who sweeps the mountain villa?”

Sui Jingcheng said, “Very good.”

Chen Ping'an asked again, “What do you think of the few disciples he taught?”

Sui Jingcheng responded, “Though I’m not familiar with their true natures, at least they seem fine.”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “Have you ever considered that with Wang Dun, it’s not just about adding another master to the mountain villa? How much impact has Wang Dun had on the martial world of Wuling and even the whole of Wuling Kingdom?”

He continued, “So I want to see, in the future, when the Sui family of Wuling Kingdom has another cultivator, even if she doesn’t stay in the Sui family often, when she replaces the old minister Sui Xinyu or assumes the next nominal head, she will always be the true backbone of the Sui family. Will the Sui family then give rise to a family tradition worthy of the term ‘genuine’?”

Sui Jingcheng looked at him.

Chen Ping'an spoke to himself, “I think there is hope.”

Finally, Chen Ping'an smiled. “I have Luopo Mountain, and you have the Sui family. One shouldn’t be overly arrogant, but also don’t belittle yourself. It’s difficult for one person to change the world all at once. But we are constantly changing the world.”

Sui Jingcheng murmured in agreement.

A moment later, Chen Ping'an turned his head, seemingly puzzled.

Sui Jingcheng looked confused. “Senior, what’s wrong?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, tucking the sword-sheathing gourd away. “Earlier, when you wanted to desperately seek death, that was certainly commendable. But I must tell you something rather uninteresting: wishing to die to endure suffering for others only leads to greater discomfort for yourself. This is an admirable thing, yet not everyone can understand it. Don’t let that lack of understanding become your burden.”

Sui Jingcheng’s face flushed suddenly as she exclaimed, “Senior, can I like you?!”

Chen Ping'an maintained his calm demeanor, his heart as still as water. “Like me? That’s your business; I won’t like you.”

Sui Jingcheng felt a weight lift off her shoulders, smiling, “That’s fine!”

Chen Ping'an seemed to recall something joyful, grinning broadly as he extended his thumb toward Sui Jingcheng riding alongside him. “Good eye.”

On the road to the north.

“Senior, don’t drink anymore; you’re bleeding non-stop.”

“It’s fine; this is called the demeanor of a master.”

“Senior, why don’t you like me? Is it because I’m not pretty, or is my character lacking?”

“It has nothing to do with whether you’re good or bad. Every good girl deserves to be liked by a good man. You should like him, and he should like you; that’s how it should be. Of course, you’re not young anymore; you can’t exactly be called a girl.”

“Senior!”

“Lastly, let me teach you a lesson from the old man Wang Dun: you should be able to listen to beautiful compliments as well as harsh truths.”

As the hooves echoed.

Walking along, the old locust tree from home was gone.

Walking along, the beloved girl was still far away.

Walking along, the most respected teacher was no longer present in the spring breeze where flowers bloom on the hills every year.

Walking along, the most admired swordsman had not been seen for a long time; he wouldn’t still be wearing that conical hat, would he? Has he found a good sword?

Walking along, the dearest friend wondered if he had ever seen the tallest mountains or the largest rivers.

Walking along, the snotty worm who had always been bullied had turned into the person they once despised most.

Walking along, he hadn’t worn straw sandals in many years.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 616: Just Small Matters

In the bustling Sicao Mountain Villa, a rather dull disciple named Lu Zhuo sent out a letter. This letter was then relayed by the recipient through a flying sword—a method of communication favored by immortals—to a certain man with the surname Qi residing on the mountain.

Lu Zhuo and this man had once encountered each other in the martial world by chance, quickly becoming friends. However, in reality, that friend was a true prodigy, while Lu Zhuo was merely average in martial talent. Compared to his fellow disciples, such as Fu Loutai and Wang Jingshan, as well as their younger siblings, Lu Zhuo was often considered the least gifted. Thus, he resigned himself to the idea that his ultimate position at Sicao Mountain Villa would be to take over the duties of the aging steward, assisting senior brother Wang Jingshan with various trivial matters.

Lu Zhuo loved Sicao Mountain Villa, enjoying the lively atmosphere where everyone was amicable. His master and fellow disciples took good care of him, and since he felt he had little ability to care for them in return, he focused on looking after those he could, such as the elderly and children in the villa.

In his spare time, Lu Zhuo enjoyed watching Wang Jingshan diligently teach the younger disciples sword techniques. His junior sister often lamented her darker complexion, feeling she lacked the beauty and grace of her senior sister. As for her knife techniques, they always seemed leagues behind. Lu Zhuo never quite knew how to console her, but he was content just listening to her worries.

It had been several years since their master had wandered the world, and now he had once again left the villa. Lu Zhuo wondered what stories from the martial realm his master would bring back this time.

Meanwhile, Wang Dun quietly left the villa, heading to a place outside the martial world, where he found his eldest disciple, Fu Loutai. They met in a small county town some distance from the villa, where they shared a meal and drinks. Fu Loutai had picked up some culinary skills and personally prepared three dishes to accompany their drinks. The flavors were quite unremarkable—too salty peanuts, bland lotus slices—but Wang Dun didn’t mention it. Instead, he appreciated the warmth in Fu Loutai’s gaze and the young man’s smile. After all, the wine was decent, though it was his own supply; there were still a few jars of fine plum wine hidden in the villa.

The young man was not eloquent; he simply drank in silence, offering no flattering words. Whenever Wang Dun talked about the happenings at the villa, he would occasionally raise his cup for a toast, and Wang Dun would reciprocate.

Fu Loutai sat quietly by their side. Even with two grown men drinking slowly, they could only prolong the time for so long.

Wang Dun finally said, “Drinking with you is no less enjoyable than drinking with that sword immortal. If the opportunity arises, when that sword immortal visits Sicao Mountain Villa, I’ll make sure to delay him for a while and invite you and Loutai along.”

The man appeared anxious, quickly putting down his cup and chopsticks. “No, no! I can’t keep up with the conversation. I wouldn’t be able to utter a word at the same table as that sword immortal.”

Wang Dun laughed, “You’ll find common ground. Trust me. After you two talk, I’ll see which of those little brats at the villa dares to look down on you.”

The man, his face flushed, hesitated. “Loutai following me was already a huge burden. It’s only natural that her fellow disciples aren’t pleased. But honestly, I understand their concern; they’re looking out for her. I’m actually quite happy about it. It’s a good thing that she has so many people who care for her.”

Wang Dun poured a few drops of wine into their cups and gestured for Fu Loutai not to fetch more. He turned to the young man, “If you can think like this, then Loutai following you isn’t a burden at all.”

Opening his pack, Wang Dun took out a jar of wine. “I didn’t bring any other gifts, just this good wine. I only have three jars: one I’ve already drunk most of, another hidden in the villa for when I retire, and this is the last jar.”

Fu Loutai recognized its value and asked, “Master, is this immortal wine?”

Wang Dun nodded with a smile. “After I sparred with that sword immortal, he noticed my martial virtue surpassed my skill and gifted me three jars. What could I do? I couldn’t refuse.”

Fu Loutai chuckled, “Others may not know, but I do. Master, you’re not short on divine coins; you could buy more.”

Wang Dun shook his head. “It’s different. There aren’t many people in the mountains who carry the spirit of the martial world.”

Fu Loutai spoke straightforwardly, “Isn’t it just showing off that you drank with the sword immortal? If I’m not mistaken, that remaining jar is meant for your old friends in the martial world, right? To discuss your sparring?”

The man gently tugged at her sleeve. Fu Loutai reassured him, “It’s fine, Master.”

Wang Dun laughed and scolded, “Once a girl is married, she’s like spilled water! Now go, don’t send me off. Whenever you have time, come visit the villa; it’s still home.”

The couple walked him to the door. As the sun set, the rays cast a long shadow of the old man.

The man gently held her hand, feeling guilty. “Being looked down upon by the villa still bothers me a bit. I lied to your master earlier.”

She softly squeezed his hand. “It’s alright. I know he understands.”

Du Yu didn’t dare return to Ghost Axe Palace immediately; instead, he wandered the martial world alone.

He chose to observe the numerous injustices and occasional disputes among the mountain cultivators with a detached eye. Now, he regarded everyone he met as a hidden expert, and it would take some time for him to adjust.

He felt distressed, wondering when he could finally be a good person with a sense of righteousness.

One day, he stumbled upon an uneven martial chase where a group of prominent figures was pursuing a disciple of the righteous path.

In a flash, Du Yu knocked down the ruffians and carried the young man away, running for dozens of miles before tossing him onto the ground and escaping.

The young man sat dazed on the ground, while the distant ruffians were equally confounded.

At the Bone Marsh, the Pi Ma Sect remained. 

In the mural city, only one shop remained open, its business slow. However, as it was the only one, it managed to survive, attracting some curious visitors.

On this rare day, Pang Lanxi descended from the mountain and came to lend a hand. 

Though Pang Lanxi’s training had become increasingly demanding, their meetings had become fewer compared to previous years.

Yet, the girl’s eyes sparkled with hope; she had never felt so eager for the future.

Even when she didn’t see Pang Lanxi, her worries diminished significantly.

At Jinwu Palace, Liu Zhiqing sat alone atop the peak.

Only a handful of cultivators, including the palace master, knew that this little master uncle had started a prolonged retreat, hence the mountain was sealed off.

No one was allowed to ascend.

As for why Liu Zhiqing was meditating at the summit, among those few who knew, no one dared to ask.

At the Bone Marsh, by the river’s edge, a rare wild cultivator couple who had lingered at the immortal’s inn for days finally saw the woman step out of their room after reaching the cave dwelling realm. The man was teary-eyed.

Once inside, after closing the door, the woman softly said, “We still have so much snowflake money left.”

She wiped her tears, “I know, after sending those white bones from Ghost Valley, that sword immortal never intended to return to the Naihe Pass market to find us. Why?”

The man smiled, “It’s a debt; it’s left for later. Whether we can repay it when we meet that benefactor is our issue. But wanting to repay is also our concern.”

At Cangjun Lake, with the lake lord financing and secretly planning, the Fire God Temple in Suijia City was rebuilt, with a new painted statue installed.

The incense offerings were abundant.

However, the City God Temple had yet to be completed, and the court had not issued a decree for a new city god in some time.

In Suijia City, two boys in a shabby alley were blocked at both ends by a group of young ruffians wielding sticks, laughing as they approached.

One tall boy pressed his hands against the walls and quickly climbed over to the other side.

The other frail boy followed suit, but his speed was slow. He was caught by someone who yanked him by the ankle and sent him sprawling to the ground, a stick coming down towards his head.

The frail boy shielded his head with his arms.

The blow sent him reeling against the wall.

The tall boy, who could have escaped, lightly leaped down. Since he was a bit high off the ground, he nimbly used the walls of the alley to land, throwing a few punches to knock down several ruffians. Yet, he soon found himself outnumbered and was beaten without mercy, still trying to protect the frail boy pressed against the wall.

In the end, the tall boy’s head was pinned to the ground, while the frail boy was beaten around, rolling against the wall.

One of the young ruffians stepped on the tall boy’s head and waved for someone to bring over a prepared white bowl. The ruffian pinched his nose and quickly placed the bowl on the ground.

“If you dare ruin our fun, you’ll learn your lesson.”

The young ruffian tossed a handful of coins beside the bowl, saying, “See? The money and food are all ready for you. Eat what’s in the bowl, and the money is yours. If you eat quickly, you might even earn a piece of silver. If you don’t eat, I’ll break one of your legs.”

The tall boy stubbornly refused.

The frail boy let out a wail; he had been struck hard on the back.

Finally, the group of ruffians laughed heartily and departed, of course, not forgetting to pocket the coins.

The tall boy squatted against the wall, retching.

The bruised frail boy sat against the wall, crying out loud.

The tall boy struggled to stand, eventually sitting beside his friend. “It’s alright; one day we will get our revenge.”

After a long silence, the frail boy stopped crying, lost in thought, and finally said softly, “I want to be someone like that sword immortal.”

He wiped his tears, not daring to look at the tall boy beside him. “Is that foolish?”

The tall boy ruffled his hair. “Of course not! Who knows? That sword immortal could have been worse than us at our age! You always sneak into the academy to listen to the old sage’s lectures, right? My favorite saying—what was it again?”

The frail boy replied, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way!”

Then he lowered his head, saying, “But even if I gain skills, I don’t want to be like those bullies.”

The tall boy laughed, “No worries. When we become sword immortals, you’ll do good, and I… I won’t do bad things; I’ll only bully the bad guys! Come, let’s vow!”

The two boys raised their hands and clapped together with a hearty smack.

The tall boy turned to him and exhaled, “How does it smell?”

The frail boy quickly pushed him a little, and they playfully bantered back and forth, soon both grinning with laughter.

They looked up together; the narrow alley seemed vast, with only a thin line of light marking their way out.

But that light, after all, was right above their heads, and they could see it.

In the country of Shushui, Song Yushao left the villa in the summer, heading to a familiar tavern in the town, where he sat at his usual spot and enjoyed a steaming hot pot.

The old man was quite pleased with himself, muttering, “Kid, see? This is the spiciest! I used to cater to your tastes, but when it comes to swordsmanship, you might be better, but when it comes to spicy food, I can take on several of you!”

In the country of Caiyi, an emaciated old woman lay on her sickbed, one withered hand gently held by a woman sitting at the bedside.

The old woman, on the verge of exhaustion, struggled to open her eyes, murmuring, “My lord, my lady, this year’s wine hasn’t been brewed yet… If Young Master Chen comes, he won’t have wine to drink.”

With teary eyes, the woman leaned down softly, whispering, “Don’t worry, don’t worry. I will brew this year’s wine with my own hands.”

The old woman continued to murmur, her voice faint as a mosquito’s buzz. “Also, Young Master Chen loves that stir-fried winter bamboo shoots with meat. Lady, remember to serve him in a big white bowl, not a cup… This should have been done by the maid, but now it’s up to you, my lady. Don’t forget, don’t forget.”

After Cui Dongshan left the Guanhai Academy, Zhou Ju thought him quite an extraordinary person.

Not long after Cui Dongshan departed, both Guanhai Academy and the Daxi Mountain Cliff Academy to the north underwent some changes.

From the Mountain Master of the Sage to all the vice-masters, every gentleman and sage had to allocate enough time each year to teach at various royal academies and state schools.

No longer would sages pass down teachings to gentlemen, gentlemen to sages, and sages to academic students.

Throughout the territories of Great Li, excluding private academies, all town and rural schools, as well as the court and government offices, offered increased salaries to teachers. As for the amount, it varied by region. Those who had taught for over twenty years received a one-time bonus. After that, every ten years, they received an additional reward.

On this day, a carefree young man in white finally witnessed an entire lively scene, appearing serenely in a once-thriving mansion now devoid of life.

In the end, he sat side by side with a young maid by the railing.

The girl had been implicated by the lady of the house for her affair, and when the news broke, she was killed by a pair of righteous brothers who made their way to the back courtyard. In the chaos, she was stabbed by a sharp knife.

The lady of the house fared worse, being brutally killed by her furious husband.

At that moment, the man who exposed the affair, with fiery eyes and a trembling hand, held the knife. 

He remembered the first time he met his sister-in-law; she had greeted him with a flowery smile before gracefully moving to the inner courtyard. As she lifted the curtain and crossed the threshold, her embroidered shoes got caught at the entrance. She paused but did not turn around, using her toes to pick up the shoes and stepping over the threshold, slowly leaving.

After that, he had maintained his restraint and patience, only allowing himself to steal a few more glances, which led him to witness that scandal.

Cui Dongshan placed his hands on his knees, conversing with the already lifeless maid, “The world may get better, or it may worsen; who knows?”

A boy carrying a massive sword rack, with swords that looked like a peacock’s tail, walked slowly alongside his master toward the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Earlier, his master had taken him to the most forbidden place in the world, where thrones floated, varying in height.

His master brought him to stand in the place that belonged to him.

“Master, who’s faster with the sword: that old sword immortal or your friend Ah Liang?”

“Hard to say.”

“Master, why did you choose me as your disciple? I’ve never quite understood; before today, I didn’t even dare to think about it.”

“Because you are the one with the greatest potential to draw the sword quickly in our wild world. You may not become the swordsman standing at the forefront of the battlefield, but you will surely be the one at the back who leads.”

The boy was anxious. “How can I compare to you, Master?”

Gripping the boy’s neck gently, he lifted him up, “You may doubt yourself as a slow-witted waste, or as a lowly mixed-breed. But you must not doubt my vision.”

With one hand gripping the boy’s neck and the other pointing, he explained whose thrones they were.

Finally, he released him, his expression unchanged. “What you need to do is, if one day you find them displeasing, to at least draw your sword one time less than me.”

“The moment I determine you can never do that in your life, you are free to die. Not everyone with talent akin to yours will have the same opportunities as you, so cherish every moment you have now.”

A young Daoist wearing a lotus crown began to travel the world with a youthful Daoist without a crown.

They exchanged Dao robes that concealed their identities.

The former only had one requirement for the latter: to act freely without any consequences, following his heart.

However, there was a prerequisite: act within your means and don’t seek your own demise.

The young Daoist hesitated and asked a question, “Can I kill innocents indiscriminately?”

The young Daoist smiled and nodded, the word “Of course” escaping his lips. After a pause, he added, “That would be best.”

The young Daoist nodded.

Then the young Daoist asked, “Do you know what an innocent is? Do you know what indiscriminate killing means?”

The young Daoist fell into deep thought.

The young Daoist shook his head, “You used to know, even if it was superficial, but now you don’t know at all. So, being too clever can be detrimental. I had a similar inquiry once, and the answer I arrived at was far better than yours.”

The boy’s face turned pale.

Because this little master brother was Lu Chen, the current master of Bai Yu Jing.

Even though the boy was the closed-door disciple of the Dao Ancestor.

Facing this little master brother who could crush him into a pulp with a single slap, the boy felt deep respect from the bottom of his heart.

Upon leaving Bai Yu Jing, Lu Chen smiled and said, “Having suffered a little hardship at the bottom, enjoying the great fortune of Bai Yu Jing, and having died once, it’s time to learn how to live well. You should walk the middle path between the mountains.”

At that time, he asked Lu Chen, “Little master brother, does it take many years?”

Lu Chen replied that if one learned quickly, a few decades would suffice; if slowly, a few hundred or even a thousand years would be normal.

Finally, Lu Chen grinned, “Don’t worry, if you die, my little brother’s Dao techniques are quite good; I can save you again.”

In reality, after the boy’s resurrection, his new body was remarkably gifted with innate Dao bones; in cultivation terms, he was already at the Cave Dwelling realm from the start.

Not only that, but within his three vital acupoints lay three immortal weapons, awaiting his slow refinement.

According to Lu Chen, they were gifts prepared by his three senior brothers, assuring him to accept them without worry.

Aside from that, the boy’s most valuable possession was his Dao robe, known as “Lotus Seed,” which was a semi-immortal artifact.

It had the lowest rank, but now, throughout the entire Qingming world, aside from a handful of enlightened immortals, nobody knew its origin.

In simple terms, wearing this Dao robe, the young Daoist could venture into any other realm, and in the most dangerous places, the higher the realm of those in charge, the safer he would be.

One day, with nothing to do, Lu Chen was composing music alone above the sea of clouds while the young Daoist sat cross-legged beside him.

Lu Chen smiled and said, “Qi Jingchun played his last game in this life. The black and white pieces were clearly defined, and the arrangement was intricate, with strict rules. It was already the end of a predetermined game. When he decided to make his first and only illegal move in his life, he never placed again. Yet he saw the board illuminated by radiant light, a brilliant spectrum.”

The boy asked curiously, “Is this what little master brother personally observed and deduced?”

Lu Chen shook his head, “No, it was our master who told me, and more importantly, it was Qi Jingchun speaking to our master.”

The boy was speechless.

Lu Chen smiled broadly, gently placing a hand on the boy’s head, “If Qi Jingchun dared to offer such hope to a muddy-legged boy, what about you?! What about me?”

After long travels through the mortal realm, the boy had matured, his intuition keen, and he blurted out, “It has nothing to do with me.”

Lu Chen retracted his hand, laughing heartily.

The two brothers continued their journey through the Qingming world.

One day, the boy asked, “Will little master brother’s company delay your important matters after leaving Bai Yu Jing?”

The young Daoist shook his head and smiled, “There are no major matters in this world.”

At the run-down Bamboo Loft of the Fallen Star Mountain, Cui Cheng rarely came down from the second floor.

Zhu Lian, Zheng Dafeng, and Wei Bo had already gathered.

Wei Bo held the tong leaf umbrella that Chen Ping’an had brought from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land years ago.

Cui Cheng nodded and said, “Bring Pei Qian here to join us. Since we’re dividing the Lotus Flower Blessed Land into four, and we occupy one, let Zhu Lian and Pei Qian go check it out first.”

Wei Bo summoned his innate divine ability, and the charcoal girl practicing her mad sword technique in the back courtyard of the Qilong Alley suddenly found herself appearing outside the Bamboo Loft, enraged. “What is it?! I still need to practice my sword and copy books!”

Wei Bo said solemnly, “You and Zhu Lian are going to the Southern Garden of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.”

Pei Qian was left dumbfounded.

Wei Bo opened the umbrella, releasing a cascade of radiant light from its surface.

Zhu Lian took Pei Qian and stepped into it.

In the next moment, Zhu Lian and Pei Qian found themselves in the capital city of the Southern Garden, where Pei Qian rubbed her eyes, recognizing the all-too-familiar street, the alley just ahead.

During the light rain, Pei Qian waved her walking stick randomly, laughing heartily.

A scholar in a blue robe flew in.

The national teacher of the Southern Garden, Zhong Qiu.

Zhu Lian glanced at him. “Oh, an expert.”

Zhong Qiu seemed to see the two “exiled immortals” appear in the capital of the Southern Garden. He wasn’t puzzled; instead, he smiled and asked, “Where’s Chen Ping’an?”

Pei Qian raised an eyebrow, puffing out her chest, and said with a mature tone, “My master is busy, so I, as the founding disciple, came to see you first! By the way, I’m Pei Qian! The one with a lot of money!”

Then, as if struck by lightning, Pei Qian lost all her arrogance.

She even felt a bit cold all over.

After leaving the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, she remained in a daze until she finally regained her senses.

Wei Bo and Zheng Dafeng found it strange.

Zhu Lian shook his head, signaling not to ask too much.

That day, for the first time in her life, Pei Qian proactively came to the second floor of the Bamboo Loft, greeted everyone, and after receiving permission, she took off her shoes and neatly placed them at the threshold. Even the walking stick was leaned against the outer wall. After closing the door, she sat cross-legged, facing the barefoot old man.

The old man asked, “What brings you here? Are you perhaps looking to learn boxing from me?”

For some reason, the charcoal girl, who had never grown up over the years, nodded vigorously. “I want to learn boxing!”

The old man asked, “Are you afraid of hardship?”

Pei Qian’s eyes gleamed with determination. “I’m not afraid of death!”

The old man chuckled, “What a bold claim! You’ll probably end up crying like a baby, huh? Fallen Star Mountain won’t have Chen Ping’an to protect you. Once you decide to learn boxing with me, there’s no turning back.”

Pei Qian spoke seriously, “I’ve thought it over. Even if I cry and regret later, you must beat me until I dare not cry or backtrack!”

The old man seemed a bit surprised by this answer, laughing heartily. He then looked into the little girl’s eyes, “One last question—why do you want to learn boxing?”

Pei Qian clenched her fists, remaining silent for a long time before speaking. “I can’t be outdone by anyone, except for one person. I absolutely must not lose!”

The old man replied, “Oh, good. From today onward, you are my closed-door disciple, Cui Cheng. Don’t worry, there’s no need for any nonsense about master-disciple titles.”

Pei Qian raised her hand, wiped her tears, and nodded heavily, standing up to bow in gratitude.

The old man, who had never been pretentious with Chen Ping’an, unexpectedly stood up, hands clasped behind his back, and solemnly accepted her bow.

Pei Qian stepped forward, pulled back her foot, and struck a fighting stance. “Come!”

Cui Cheng vanished in a flash, pressing the charcoal girl’s head against the wall. Pei Qian’s bones creaked as she bled from her orifices.

The old man smiled and asked, “Still want to learn?!”

Pei Qian shouted, “I’ll learn even if it kills me!”

The old man nodded, “Very well.”

Once, in the alley of the capital city of the Southern Garden, a young man in a blue robe emerged, holding an oiled paper umbrella. With a warm smile, he looked at Pei Qian, slightly surprised, and said, “Pei Qian, long time no see.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 617: Encountering the Landbound Jiao Dragon by the Great River

The Northern Yan Kingdom was known for its flat terrain. After the new emperor ascended to the throne, he diligently worked to improve the kingdom. With two prime horse-breeding areas, the cavalry's combat power far surpassed that of the Jingnan and Wuling kingdoms. Further north lay the Green Warbler Kingdom, a place steeped in legends of immortal beings. Many literary works and strange tales from this region involved water spirit jiao dragons.

On this day, Sui Jingcheng, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a robe made of bamboo, paused under the shade of a tree by the riverbank. Despite the scorching summer sun, she managed well while riding, though she tended to care more for her horse. 

Two riders halted their horses by the river, where the water was crystal clear and the surroundings deserted. She removed her hat and took off her boots and socks, letting her feet sink into the cool water as she let out a long sigh of relief.

Her companion, an experienced elder, sat not far away, retrieving a jade bamboo fan. Instead of waving it to create a breeze, he merely opened it and gently swayed it, revealing characters that floated like duckweed on the surface of the stream. She had seen these before; the elder mentioned they were celestial writings that had fallen from a talisman ship at a residence called Spring Dew Garden.

Sui Jingcheng harbored concern for the elder's injury. His left shoulder had been pierced directly by a powerful arrow from a cultivator, and he had been ensnared by talismans. It baffled her how he seemed unaffected, merely rubbing his right hand frequently as they traveled.

Sui Jingcheng turned to ask, “Elder, was it the assassin sent by Master Cao Fu and the Golden Scale Palace?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “That’s the most likely possibility. The characteristics of that group of assassins are quite distinct. They hail from a renowned sect in southern North Julu Continent. Despite being called a sect, other than the name Cutting Deer Mountain, they have no solid foundation. All their assassins are referred to as ‘Faceless Ones.’ Practitioners from all walks of life can join, but I hear the regulations are quite strict regarding how to join, how to kill, and how much to charge.”

Chen Pingan smiled, “Cutting Deer Mountain has one major rule: once a contract is accepted and payment is made, they’ll only attempt the assassination once. If they fail, they take only half of the deposit, regardless of the severity of the casualties. After that, Cutting Deer Mountain will never pursue the target again. So at least for now, we don’t have to worry about their interference.”

Sui Jingcheng sighed, a hint of sadness and guilt in her eyes. “In the end, it was still aimed at me.”

Despite the elder’s calm demeanor, Sui Jingcheng was observant enough to sense that the recent assassination attempt had not been easily handled.

Chen Pingan closed the fan and spoke slowly, “On the path of cultivation, blessings and calamities are intertwined. Most Qi practitioners endure their trials through this process. The hardships can vary greatly, but the scale of suffering is subjective. I once knew a couple at the lower realms who struggled for hundreds of snowflake coins and could not break through their bottleneck. If they delayed any longer, good fortune could turn into misfortune, endangering their lives. They had no choice but to risk entering the Bone Marsh in the south to seek fortune. The emotional turmoil they endured along the way was a true suffering, wouldn’t you agree? It certainly was, and not minor at that. It’s not as easy as your journey so far.”

Sui Jingcheng chuckled, “Did you happen to encounter them and lend a hand?”

Chen Pingan said nothing.

Sui Jingcheng understood the answer.

Chen Pingan pointed the fan toward her. 

With a knowing smile, Sui Jingcheng sat cross-legged, closed her eyes, and began to focus her mind, breathing in and out as she practiced the incantations from the *Supreme Mystical Collection.*

During cultivation, as one breathed, subtle ripples of spiritual energy would ripple out, keeping mosquitoes and flies at bay while warding off cold and heat.

Although Sui Jingcheng had yet to complete her cultivation, she had already formed a faint aura, which was quite rare. It reminded Chen Pingan of his early days practicing the Mountain Shaking Fist in his hometown. Though his stance had not been stable, he had been unaware of the flow of his fist intent within him until a certain protector on Zhenwu Mountain saw through it instantly. Thus, Sui Jingcheng’s talent was indeed remarkable. However, it puzzled him why the wandering master who had gifted her three items had disappeared for over thirty years. This year was evidently a significant trial in Sui Jingcheng’s cultivation journey. Logically, even if that master were millions of miles away, he should still retain some ethereal sense of connection.

The details of that master’s appearance and demeanor were equally strange, resembling the little booklet Sui Jingcheng could only glance at, as reading it could disturb her inner energy, leaving her dizzy.

In previous years, when Sui Jingcheng had inquired with the elders at her home, they all claimed to have vague memories. Even the old official Sui Xinyu, who had an exceptional memory, could recall nothing.

Chen Pingan realized this was no ordinary illusion technique employed by mountain cultivators.

After half an hour had passed with Sui Jingcheng’s eyes still closed, a radiant glow enveloped her. The aura from her bamboo robe also exuded spiritual energy, creating a harmonious blend of colors akin to the fusion of water and fire. While ordinary people could only make out a vague image, Chen Pingan could see much more. When Sui Jingcheng halted her energy circulation, the phenomenon around her dissipated in an instant. It was evident that the bamboo robe was carefully chosen by the master to aid Sui Jingcheng’s cultivation of the techniques recorded in her small booklet, allowing her to achieve twice the results with half the effort.

The atmosphere was lofty and upright.

Therefore, Chen Pingan leaned towards the idea that the master had no malicious intent towards Sui Jingcheng.

However, it was essential to take things step by step. After all, on the path of cultivation, a single mistake could lead to catastrophic failure despite a thousand precautions.

The two did not attempt to conceal their whereabouts; instead, they left traces of their journey, much like when they had wandered through the small town of Sweeping Mountain Villa. If they continued toward the Green Warbler Kingdom without the master making an appearance, Chen Pingan could only arrange for Sui Jingcheng to board the celestial ferry to the Bone Marsh and then proceed to the Niujiao Mountain dock on Baoping Continent. According to Sui Jingcheng’s wishes, they would register with Cui Dongshan and cultivate alongside him. Chen Pingan believed that if there was a true fate, Sui Jingcheng would eventually reunite with that master and rekindle their mentor-disciple bond.

Upon reaching the dock in Green Warbler Kingdom pointed out by the elder Wang Dun, the information Chen Pingan most wanted to know was the situation regarding the Jade Seal River Jiao in the capital of the Great Seal.

Had the sword immortal Ji Yue from Yuantai Mountain already clashed with that tenth-tier martial artist?

Sui Jingcheng put on her socks and boots, stood up, and looked up at the sky. Earlier, the sun had blazed down, and the heat had been unbearable, but now dark clouds had gathered, signaling the arrival of a storm.

Chen Pingan had already walked toward the horse-tethering area and reminded her, “We need to keep moving. It will rain in less than an incense stick’s time. You can put on your raincoat.”

Sui Jingcheng jogged over, smiling as she asked, “Elder, can you predict the weather? Earlier at the rest stop, you also seemed to know when the rain would stop. My father said only the experts from the Wuling Kingdom’s Astronomical Bureau have such abilities.”

Chen Pingan adjusted his hat, donned his raincoat, and mounted his horse, saying, “Do you want to learn this skill?”

Sui Jingcheng nodded eagerly, “Of course!”

Chen Pingan grinned, “You should work the fields for over a decade, begging the heavens for food year-round. Naturally, you’ll learn to read the signs.”

Sui Jingcheng had no retort.

In truth, Chen Pingan had only shared half of the answer. The other half pertained to martial practitioners who could sense the minutiae of the world, such as the wind rustling leaves, mosquitoes buzzing, and dragonflies skimming the water. These subtle movements were not insignificant in his view. Explaining them to someone like Sui Jingcheng, who was on the path of cultivation, would be pointless.

A torrential downpour soon arrived as expected.

The two riders continued forward without attempting to evade the rain. Throughout the journey north, Sui Jingcheng had never complained about the hardships of wind, sun, and rain. She quickly realized that this too was part of cultivation. If, while bouncing on horseback, she could find a suitable rhythm of breathing, even amidst heavy rain, she could maintain clarity of vision. In the sweltering heat, she could sometimes glimpse the faint “flow of water” obscured within the mist. The elder had mentioned that was the essence of the world’s spiritual energy. Thus, while riding, Sui Jingcheng often weaved back and forth, trying to capture those fleeting threads of spiritual energy. Although she never succeeded, her bamboo robe could absorb them.

The downpour was brief, coming and going swiftly.

After the rain, the two riders removed their raincoats and continued on their way.

Before nightfall, they stopped at a bustling county city, where there was a Water God Temple upstream. However, that wasn’t the only reason for their visit. The main attraction lay in the proximity of the river and the mountains: the river was named the Yao Ming River, and the mountain was called E’e Mountain. The shrine for the water deity and the mountain deity were less than three miles apart. The elder had mentioned this was an incredibly rare sight, and it was necessary to see it. Sui Jingcheng had always been puzzled as to why the elder was so fond of visiting famous sites. She feared there might be something significant in these locations, so she kept her thoughts to herself.

In the Northern Yan Kingdom, cricket fighting was all the rage.

Many citizens ventured out of the city to the wilderness for a night of cricket-catching, selling them for profit. Poets and scholars had written extensively about crickets, often using them to critique current affairs and subtly mock the times. The concerns of literary figures throughout history were often alleviated through poetry and prose, while the grand mansions of high officials and the cramped quarters of the common folk alike found joy in the chirping of crickets.

Thus, when the two riders first entered the city, the number of people leaving far exceeded those coming in, each carrying various cricket cages, a rather peculiar sight.

The inn was quite large and was said to have been renovated from a former post station. Its current owner was a son of a noble family from the capital, who had bought it at a low price and, after investing heavily in renovations, saw the business thrive. Many walls still bore the calligraphy of scholars, and there was a lush bamboo pond behind it.

At night, as Chen Pingan stepped out to stroll along the willow-lined path by the pond, he returned to his room to practice his fist techniques. Just then, Sui Jingcheng, wearing her wide-brimmed hat, stood on the path. Chen Pingan remarked, “It’s fine; you can walk alone without worry.”

Sui Jingcheng nodded, watching as the elder walked away. After a short walk, she returned to her room.

Chen Pingan continued practicing the Six Steps Stance, circulating his sword energy through eighteen pauses, but he still could not break through the final bottleneck.

At times, he pondered whether his swordsmanship talent was truly that poor.

Back then, after crossing the Upside Down Mountain and Sword Energy Great Wall, many young prodigies swiftly grasped the essence of the eighteen pauses.

However, Chen Pingan also found solace in knowing that among the critical points in the eighteen pauses, three were home to “extremely small sword energies,” creating significant obstructions. The final bottleneck was within one of those areas, and every time he reached that point, his energy would stagnate.

After stopping his practice, Chen Pingan began to draw talismans, using the most ordinary yellow paper. Compared to the typical lower realm wandering cultivators who could only use gold and silver powder as “ink,” Chen Pingan had purchased quite a bit of mountain-sourced cinnabar from a store on Old Huai Street in Spring Dew Garden. He had a whole collection of jars, most costing around three or four snowflake coins each, with the most expensive large porcelain jar priced at a small summer coin. During this journey, he had spent a considerable amount on three hundred talismans, proving that sometimes quantity could prevail.

Sui Jingcheng had good luck, having found two manuals on that array master’s person: one was a talismanic illustration manual, and the other was a genuine explanation of formation techniques, though it was missing pages. There was also a notebook of sorts, detailing the array master’s insights since he began studying talismans. This notebook was the most valuable to Chen Pingan.

Of course, there was also the sturdy man’s armor of decent quality, a large bow, and all the talisman arrows.

Not to mention the two talisman knives from the female assassin, engraved with “Morning Dew” and “Evening Glow.”

Unfortunately, there wasn’t a single snowflake coin of immortal money.

This sudden battle was the closest he had come to the atmosphere of the ambush at the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.

Though Chen Pingan was heavily injured, he also gained immensely.

Once, during a leisurely game of chess with Sui Jingcheng, she had curiously asked, “Elder, you’re left-handed?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “I’ve been that way since I was young. But after I left my hometown not long after I started practicing martial arts, I pretended otherwise.”

The leader of those Cutting Deer Mountain assassins, the river-surface sword cultivator, had been observing quietly at that time, ensuring there were no surprises. He repeatedly checked the distribution of the Northern Yan cavalry’s corpses on the ground, and since Chen Pingan had stabbed the Northern Yan cavalry commander with his right hand, he confirmed what he had seen. This led the Cutting Deer Mountain assassin, who had concealed his most powerful techniques, to employ a Buddhist secret technique that restrained Chen Pingan’s right hand. The power of this secret method and its lasting effects were evident as Chen Pingan still felt some lingering impact today.

In truth, Chen Pingan had no knowledge of such peculiar secret techniques among mountain cultivators.

Thus, what seemed like luck and chance for Chen Pingan had, in fact, become his way of navigating the martial world, as if he were perpetually caught in an ambush.

Sui Jingcheng could not help but ask, “Elder, doesn’t that tire you?”

Chen Pingan chuckled, “It’s all a matter of habit. Didn’t I mention before that discussing complex principles may seem laborious, but once you become familiar with them, it becomes much lighter? When the time comes for you to strike with your fists or swords, you’ll find yourself approaching the state of being unrestrained by the heavens and earth. It’s not just about how powerful your punches or swords are; it’s about… being recognized by the world and resonating with the Dao.”

At that moment, Sui Jingcheng certainly wouldn’t grasp the grandeur of “being unrestrained by heaven and earth,” nor would she understand the profound significance of “resonating with the Dao.”

The next day, the two visited two adjacent mountain and water shrines before continuing on their journey. 

They were not far from the Green Warbler Kingdom, situated on the eastern coast of North Julu Continent.

As they walked slowly, Chen Pingan remarked, “The world is a great furnace; the sun’s heat cooks and melts all things. No one can escape it.”

Sui Jingcheng felt drowsy but perked up upon hearing the elder’s words, “Elder, is this a saying from the immortals? What deeper meaning does it hold?”

Chen Pingan shook his head with a smile, “It’s something my closest friend heard from the master who taught us to fire kilns. Back then, we were young and thought it was just a playful saying. The old man never said such things around me; in fact, he seldom wanted to speak to me at all. Even when searching deep in the mountains for suitable soil for making porcelain, we could go ten days or half a month without exchanging more than two or three words.”

Sui Jingcheng was surprised, “Does your sect still practice porcelain making? Are there such celestial residences on the mountain?”

Chen Pingan chuckled, nodding, “Indeed.”

Sui Jingcheng cautiously asked, “Then your good friend must have even greater talent in cultivation, right?”

Chen Pingan laughed, “I wouldn’t say his cultivation talent is better; in any case, I’ll never catch up to his skills in making porcelain. He grasps it just by looking, while I would need to tinker for a month, and I still wouldn’t measure up to him.”

Sui Jingcheng pressed on, “Elder, isn’t there pressure in being friends with such a person?”

Chen Pingan merely smiled in response.

As they crossed the borders of Northern Yan and Green Warbler Kingdoms, only two hundred miles remained to the celestial ferry dock.

The dock was named Longtou Ferry and was the private territory of the first-rate immortal sect, the Gu Yu Sect. It was said that the founder of the Gu Yu Sect once played a game of chess against the founding emperor of the Green Warbler Kingdom, winning a mountainside through his exceptional chess skills.

The sect had no connection with Gu Yu money, but they produced two popular items, the Gu Yu Scroll and Gu Yu Token, both of which were fawned over in the secular world. The former was sold to wealthy families in the mortal realm, with both a calligraphy and a painting version, serving as a rudimentary protective charm, far superior to the door gods posted by ordinary households in warding off evil spirits. As for the Gu Yu Token, it was worn around the waist and was a must-have for low-level Qi practitioners venturing into the mountains and rivers around the Green Warbler Kingdom. It was quite pricey, and even the ministers and nobles of the Green Warbler Kingdom possessed one, often wearing them during court meetings. The emperor would even reward loyal officials with these tokens frequently.

Longtou Ferry was a major ferry, located in the southern Great Seal Dynasty’s territory, where Qi practitioners were scarce. Other than the ferry lines within the Great Seal Kingdom and the Golden Scale Palace, there were no other celestial ferries. As the easternmost hub of North Julu Continent, the small Green Warbler Kingdom had a vastly different culture from the Great Seal’s martial chaos, where celestial beings were revered.

The two sold their horses to a major courier service in the county city.

Walking along, Chen Pingan handed his mountain staff to Sui Jingcheng.

His attire had become increasingly simple, just a wide-brimmed hat and a blue shirt, even the hairpin was tucked away, and he no longer carried the bamboo box, keeping the sword gourd and sword immortal hidden as well.

Meanwhile, Sui Jingcheng’s words had also grown scarce.

They walked along a broad river that flowed into the sea, its surface spanning several miles, though it was not the famous river that ran throughout the continent. It was said that many citizens of the Green Warbler Kingdom never had the opportunity to visit the opposite bank.

The river breeze brushed over them, dispelling the summer heat.

Sui Jingcheng asked, “Elder, if that hermit doesn’t show up, I still hope to become your disciple, even if just nominally for now. One day, if you feel I’m worthy, you can remove the ‘nominal’ title. As for whether that Elder Cui would be willing to teach me immortal techniques or guide me, I won’t press it. After all, I’ve cultivated alone for thirty years and wouldn’t mind waiting until you return from your travels.”

Chen Pingan turned to survey the rushing river, smiling, “If you don’t become his disciple, you’ll regret it; I can guarantee that.”

Sui Jingcheng shook her head firmly, “I won’t!”

Chen Pingan said, “Let’s assume your teacher never appears again; the one I introduce you to is a true immortal, whose cultivation, character, and vision are all far beyond mine.”

Of course, even if that person’s cultivation was higher, they would still be Sui Jingcheng’s teacher.

Previously, Chen Pingan hadn’t thought much of it, often viewing it as a burden. But looking back now, it felt… refreshing?

Sui Jingcheng firmly declared, “Is there really such a person in this world? I don’t believe it!”

Chen Pingan replied, “Believe it or not, hearing is false, seeing is real; when you meet him, you will understand.”

Sui Jingcheng, with her wide-brimmed hat and mountain staff, was skeptical yet felt somewhat frustrated. Even if that Elder Cui were truly an extraordinary immortal, what difference would it make?

Sui Jingcheng understood how time-consuming cultivation could be. Could the decades or even centuries of life span for mountain cultivators truly compare to the experiences of a wandering martial artist? Would there be so many stories? Once they reached the mountain, they would sit in their caves, sometimes for years, and upon descending, they would have to avoid worldly entanglements, returning alone without dragging any mud or water back with them. Was such a long life of cultivation genuinely worry-free? Moreover, it wasn’t as if a Qi practitioner’s peaceful cultivation meant they wouldn’t face disasters; they could just as easily face death or fall into a bottleneck, encountering countless barriers. Even if the scenery on the mountain was magnificent and unusual, after watching for decades, wouldn’t they eventually grow tired of it?

Sui Jingcheng felt a bit troubled.

Chen Pingan stopped, picked up a few stones, and casually tossed them into the river.

Facing the flowing river, Sui Jingcheng felt the wind wrap the thin fabric of her wide-brimmed hat around her, causing her clothes to sway.

There were many travelers on the riverside road, mostly Qi practitioners heading to Longtou Ferry.

One burly man rode past, his eyes brightening. He suddenly pulled his horse to a stop, thumping his chest with a hearty laugh, “Miss, why not come with me for a lavish feast? That pretty boy beside you looks useless!”

Sui Jingcheng chose to ignore him.

Before he could succeed in his advances, the next moment, the burly man fell into the river.

Chen Pingan had pressed down on his head and gently pushed him into the water.

The splash from that stone was significant.

The man struggled to swim upstream, howling, before whistling for his horse, which galloped away without a hint of concern to save face.

Sui Jingcheng was extremely tense. “Is this another assassin testing us?”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “No, just a lecher who can’t control himself.”

Sui Jingcheng looked aggrieved, “Elder, if there are such scoundrels on the road, what if we board the celestial ferry and encounter cultivators with ill intentions? You won’t be with me; what should I do?”

Chen Pingan replied, “Didn’t I tell you before? When we reach Longtou Ferry, I’ll make proper arrangements.”

Sui Jingcheng’s eyes reflected her grievances, “But on the path of cultivation, there are so many uncertainties and surprises.”

Chen Pingan said nothing more, merely continuing on the path.

Sui Jingcheng quickened her pace to walk alongside him and asked, “Elder, is the celestial ferry similar to ordinary riverboats?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “Pretty much. If you encounter a heavenly gale, it’ll sway like an ordinary boat, but it won’t be a significant problem. Even during thunderstorms with lightning and thunder, the ferry will pass through safely. Just treat it as enjoying the scenery. The ferry travels through the cloud sea, and many sights are quite striking. You might even see celestial cranes following us, and there will be plenty of manifestations of mountains and waters from various celestial sects.”

Sui Jingcheng smiled, “Don’t worry, Elder; I’ll take good care of myself.”

Chen Pingan sighed inwardly. The thoughts of women are often winding and uncertain, akin to illogical moves on a chessboard—how could one possibly win?

But if he truly encountered a woman he admired, does winning or losing even matter?

Chen Pingan slowly said, “The essence of the Dao is like uncut jade—each chop is painful. However, every painful moment that one endures is what leads to the achievement of cultivation. This is as crucial as the gradual progression of your future cultivation of immortal techniques. Otherwise, it would be like walking with a limp, making it easy to stumble down the mountain. In the world, force is more important than principle. Many people can find peace and achieve a balance with the world, allowing them to face things calmly. In terms of right and wrong, you must observe and think for yourself. Good people can have flaws, while bad people can have good principles. Just remember to question your own heart. This general principle was learned from someone who once wanted to kill after a bout of impatience.”

Sui Jingcheng nodded, “I’ll remember.”

As they walked, Chen Pingan pointed to two paths ahead, “The peculiarity of the world lies here. When we meet, the path of cultivation I point out will differ from anyone else’s guidance. For instance, if that half-teacher who gifted you those three opportunities were to personally teach you…”

“It would ultimately transform into two different Sui Jingcheng. The more choices there are, the more versions of Sui Jingcheng will emerge.”

Chen Pingan gestured toward one path and then the other, “As an observer, whether it’s me or you, Sui Jingcheng, no one knows which version of you will achieve greater heights or live longer. But do you know what your heart truly desires? Because that’s something you can realize at any moment.”

After walking a few dozen steps down one path, Chen Pingan paused and pointed to the other, “As we walk on, regardless of whether we endure hardship or enjoy fortune, you must remain steadfast. Then, at a certain threshold, especially after suffering greatly, you will undoubtedly experience self-doubt, looking around at the other possibilities in life that you may have discarded. After careful consideration, the answer you arrive at will be your true heart. The next steps you take will be determined by asking your heart.”

“But I tell you, at that moment, there will be a haze. We instinctively try to use the principles we’re most familiar with to persuade ourselves, which is an easy thing to do. Because as long as one is alive and can endure until any point in their life, everyone has redeemable qualities. The hard part is ensuring the heart remains unchanged while the principles shift.”

Sui Jingcheng asked timidly, “What if someone’s true heart leans toward evil? The more they persist, wouldn’t the world grow worse? Especially if they learn from their mistakes each time, wouldn’t it just get worse?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “Of course. That’s why I only say these things to myself and those close to me. Generally, there’s no need to say them to others; some people, with their fists and swords, are enough. For them, what they lack is merely strength in their fists or speed in their swords.”

As for anything more, Chen Pingan was reluctant to elaborate.

Sui Jingcheng, being astute and wise, might become confused if he spoke too much. There were many principles that would be overshadowed by the next in life, and many of the most relevant principles would be covered by new ones.

Sui Jingcheng felt bewildered and speechless.

After a long silence, they walked slowly, and she asked, “What should we do?”

Chen Pingan’s expression was indifferent, “That’s something the Confucian academies and the teachings of the sages should ponder.”

“The principles of the three teachings and the hundred schools of thought are like heavy rain falling upon the world. Depending on the time and place, it could be a long-awaited blessing after a drought, but it could also lead to disastrous floods.”

“All we can do is remain aware and grow like flowers and trees, thriving towards the sun.”

Just then, a young man in a Confucian robe, who had just brushed past them, stopped, turned around, and smiled, “I find your argument quite reasonable, but not entirely correct.”

Chen Pingan halted and turned to smile, “Why is that?”

Sui Jingcheng, feeling anxious, quickly stood behind Chen Pingan.

The young man smiled, “In the alleys of the marketplace, there are various principles. As long as ordinary people practice these principles throughout their lives, they won’t bow their heads in the presence of sages or immortals.”

Chen Pingan asked, “If a fist were to strike down, bruising the nose and swelling the face, would the principle still hold? Is it still valid? Isn’t it the most natural principle that strength dictates reason?”

The young man laughed, “Principles aren’t just for eating; they’re also not only for blocking fists. There is much suffering in the world, which is a fact, but how many peaceful people are there? Why do so many with weak fists still live peacefully? Why do those who pursue absolute freedom on the mountain still maintain a stable existence in the secular world?”

Chen Pingan asked with a smile, “Then if one has a strong fist, does that mean principles are unnecessary, and countless weaklings would flee in fear? How would you explain that? If you deny this principle, does it mean that principles will always only reside in the hands of the strong?”

The young man shook his head, “That is merely the surface. You clearly have the answer in your heart; why the perplexity?”

Chen Pingan chuckled.

The young man continued, “I am Qi Jinglong, and according to the genealogical records of the sect’s founder, my name is Liu Jinglong. Since it involves family matters, I won’t elaborate further.”

Sui Jingcheng was puzzled, as she had never heard the name “Liu Jinglong.”

Chen Pingan asked, “Then shall we continue our discussion while walking?”

Qi Jinglong smiled and followed the two as they continued along the river.

Chen Pingan said, “Regarding the principles of the three teachings, does Liu have any insights?”

Qi Jinglong replied, “I have some, though they are quite shallow. The Buddhist school has no attachments, pursuing a state where no one has a butcher’s knife in hand. Why is there a distinction between small and large vehicles? It lies in the world being quite tough; self-deliverance is simply not enough, thus one must also help others. The Taoist school seeks purity; if everyone in the world could be pure, without desires or demands, there would naturally be peace for all throughout the ages. Unfortunately, the Taoist principles are lofty, and while they are indeed good, they are not fully comprehensible in this age where the wisdom of the people is still awakening. As intelligent individuals pursue shrewd gains, the way of the Dao becomes hollow. The Buddhist teachings are vast and nearly cover the sea of suffering, but those who teach the Dharma may not necessarily possess the true teachings. The Taoist perspective sees no outsiders; even if one’s chickens and dogs ascend to heaven, what can they take with them? Only Confucianism is the most arduous; the principles in their books intertwine. Although broadly speaking, they provide shade like a great tree, if one looks up, it seems like everywhere is in conflict and can easily leave one lost in a fog.”

Chen Pingan nodded, asking, “If I recall correctly, Liu is not a Confucian disciple, so on the path of cultivation, do you pursue ‘the myriad laws of the world do not bind me’ or ‘freedom to do as one pleases without crossing the line’?”

Qi Jinglong laughed, “The former is hard to pursue for many reasons, and I’m not particularly inclined toward it, so I prefer the latter. Your earlier phrase ‘the heart remains unchanged while principles shift’ resonates deeply with me; people change, the world changes, even the old saying ‘immovable as a mountain’ is not quite right, for mountains also change. Therefore, your phrase about doing as one wishes but not crossing the line has always been a revered ideal in Confucianism, but ultimately, it still represents a form of limited freedom. In contrast, many mountain cultivators, especially those closer to the peak, relentlessly pursue absolute freedom. It’s not that I think all such individuals are bad people; it’s not that simple. In fact, those who can truly achieve absolute freedom are the true strong.”

Qi Jinglong sighed, “Those who enjoy absolute freedom are all, without exception, endowed with extremely resilient mentalities and exceptionally powerful cultivation levels, meaning they have reached the pinnacle of both strength and cultivation.”

After gaining this insight, Chen Pingan posed a question he had not been able to ask earlier when with Sui Jingcheng, “If the world is a table that shakes with loose rules, and the cultivator no longer fits within that circle, what should one do?”

Qi Jinglong answered without hesitation, “First, lend a hand. If one has both the heart and strength, they can carefully hammer in a nail or two, or sit aside and mend what’s broken.”

Qi Jinglong’s observations led him to gaze at the rushing river, sighing, “Living forever is undoubtedly a remarkable thing, but is it truly an interesting affair? I think not.”

It isn’t just the good who can expound on principles.

In fact, the bad may do so even more adeptly.

The Lord of Cangyun Lake, to avoid war and survive, navigated the sea of clouds, creating a scene of flooding his territory.

Chen Pingan, wary of repercussions, could only withdraw.

Such was the principle of the lake lord, and Chen Pingan had to heed it.

Sui Jingcheng, amidst the tumult at the rest stop, had bet that Chen Pingan would always follow them. If they fell into despair, he would surely step in to save them.

This was also Sui Jingcheng expressing her own reasoning.

In the rest stop, both the old official Sui Xinyu and the river jiao Yang Yuan, two individuals of entirely different backgrounds, instinctively spoke sentiments of similar meaning. 

Sui Xinyu had warned, “This is within the territory of the Wuling Kingdom,” reminding the group of rogue martial artists not to act recklessly. This was an invisible protection derived from the principle of rules.

This principle inherently contained the dignity of the Wuling Kingdom’s emperor and the court, along with the unspoken weight of loyalty from Wang Dun, the first person in the Wuling Kingdom.

Within the borders of the Golden Door Kingdom, across the peaks of the majestic mountain town, when Chen Pingan had twice stood idly by without intervening, a silent sword immortal had observed, approving of Chen Pingan’s reasoning, which allowed him to survive both encounters.

Previously, in Suijia City, a golden statue at the Fire God Temple, aware of its futility, still chose to generously sacrifice itself to assist Chen Pingan.

This was because Chen Pingan’s actions resonated with the principles the Fire God Temple believed in.

Was Du Mao of Tongye Sect’s fist truly strong? Yet, when he wanted to leave Tongye Continent, he still needed to abide by the rules or find loopholes in them to reach Baoping Continent.

Was the Wuling Kingdom’s rogue Hu Xinfeng’s fist small? Yet, even before dying, he articulated the principle of not bringing misfortune upon one’s family. Why did he say this? Because this was the real rule of the Wuling Kingdom, and since Hu Xinfeng spoke this way, it naturally implied that this principle had protected countless families and children over the years.

Every brash newcomer in the martial world, no matter how they fought their way through, faced far greater costs because this was the quiet retribution of principles against their fists.

In due course, these fortunate martial artists would inevitably become the very elders who automatically upheld the existing rules, becoming entrenched in the status quo.

Ahead, there was a riverside pavilion offering scenic views.

Chen Pingan halted, clasping his fists in gratitude, “Thank you, Liu, for enlightening me.”

Qi Jinglong smiled, “And thank you, Chen, for acknowledging this perspective.”

Chen Pingan shook his head, his gaze clear as he sincerely said, “Many things I pondered, ultimately, are not as profound as your insights, Liu.”

Qi Jinglong waved his hand, “How one thinks and how one acts are still two different matters.”

After a moment’s hesitation, Chen Pingan tentatively asked, “Could I offer you a drink?”

Qi Jinglong thought for a moment, shaking his head helplessly, “I never drink.”

Chen Pingan felt a bit awkward.

Sui Jingcheng found this exchange even more amusing than their earlier high-minded discussions.

Chen Pingan reached out and grabbed Qi Jinglong’s arm, “No worries, once you’ve had a drink, you’ll find it liberating.”

Qi Jinglong hesitated, then said, “Alright, if it’s unavoidable, if you drink, I’ll settle for tea.”

The three arrived at the pavilion extending over the great river.

They sat facing each other on a long bench, with the river wind blowing gently. Sui Jingcheng stood outside the pavilion, holding her mountain staff, not entering.

Qi Jinglong explained, “I have a friend named Lu Zhuo, a disciple of the elder Wang Dun from Sweeping Mountain Villa, who sent me a letter saying I might have a good conversation with you. So I came to take a chance.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “How did you end up fighting that female cultivator at Ti Li Mountain? I thought you two would get along; even if you didn’t become friends, there shouldn’t have been a life-and-death battle.”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “Just a misunderstanding. She encountered a group of malevolent cultivators from the lower world and wanted to deal with them decisively. I felt some didn’t deserve to die, so I intervened. That led to a duel at Ti Li Mountain, which was actually a trivial matter. However, even trivial matters can escalate when neither of us is willing to back down, resulting in a formation of a great conflict.”

Qi Jinglong asked, “So, are you friends with her?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “We once trained together in a blessed land.”

Qi Jinglong joked, “You wouldn’t step in to defend your friend and give me a beating, would you?”

Chen Pingan smiled and shook his head, “Who says friends always do what’s right?”

Even the highly respected elder Song Yushao had once attempted to justify killing a hundred mountain spirits and demons, arguing that it was better to kill one unjustly than to let a potential threat live.

Chen Pingan had intervened back then, blocking Elder Song’s sword.

As for Gu Can from Shujian Lake, that needed no elaboration.

Many principles can bring peace to one’s heart, but many others can weigh heavily.

Fortunately, the teachings of the scholarly sage are still present, and in this chaotic world, Chen Pingan had his own yardstick to measure everything. However, even with such guidance, he still stumbled along, moving forward clumsily.

Outside the pavilion, signs of rain began to appear, and mist covered the river’s surface.

Qi Jinglong said he didn’t drink but tea was merely an excuse since he had no belongings or possessions to carry with him. Thus, each time he descended the mountain, he only had his life-saving flying sword as company.

Seeing that he was unwilling to drink, Chen Pingan felt his persuasion skills needed improvement, and he refrained from pressing the matter.

Qi Jinglong gazed at the river, smiling, “Fine mist and rain are coming; the clouds are too dense to part.”

Chen Pingan replied, sipping his drink, “It will always clear after the rain.”

Qi Jinglong nodded, but then looked up, “But we might fear a change in weather.”

Chen Pingan smiled, “A small pavilion has two, and perhaps adding the one outside makes three. The world is vast; what is there to fear?”

Qi Jinglong sat up straight, gently placing his hands on his knees. At that moment, his eyes brightened, and he stretched out his hand, “Bring the wine!”

Chen Pingan tossed a jar of wine over, sitting cross-legged, his grin wide, “This jar of wine shall be a toast to Liu’s upcoming breakthrough into the upper fifth realm!”

“After my battle with her at Ti Li Mountain, I gained immensely and truly hold some hope.” 

Qi Jinglong imitated him, sitting cross-legged, taking a sip of wine and grimacing, “Indeed, it feels right not to drink.”

Chen Pingan chuckled, “Once you’ve had a few more jars, if you still don’t like it, I’ll admit defeat.”

Qi Jinglong shook his head, but then took two more small sips.

Suddenly, Chen Pingan asked, “How old is Liu this year?”

For some reason, seeing this young sword cultivator from North Julu reminded him of the national master from the Southern Garden Kingdom, Zhi Qiu, as well as the alley child, Cao Qinglang.

After all, Cao Qinglang was the one he had most wanted to lead out from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land back then.

Qi Jinglong laughed, “In the realm of mortals, I’d be considered in my twilight years.”

Sui Jingcheng was taken aback. The elder had previously mentioned the general ranks of mountain immortals; how could he be a half Jade Purity realm at such a young age?!

Though it was strange, it wasn’t entirely surprising. The “scholar” within the pavilion was the landbound jiao dragon of North Julu, the sword cultivator Liu Jinglong—an existence that had once brought despair close to the strongest sixth-tier martial artist, Yang Ningzhen.

Chen Pingan contemplated for a moment and nodded in admiration, “Truly impressive.”

Liu Jinglong wore a peculiar expression, taking a hearty gulp of wine and wiping his mouth with a smile, “You’re not even thirty yet, and you’re scolding me?”

Sui Jingcheng felt as if she had been struck by lightning, turning to look at the pavilion, stunned, and asked, “Didn’t the elder say he was three hundred years old?”

Chen Pingan blinked, “Did I say that?”

Sui Jingcheng maintained a straight face, solemnly insisting, “At least twice!”

Chen Pingan sipped his wine, “That’s a bit too much.”

Qi Jinglong also took a sip and glanced at the blue-clad swordsman across from him, then at the wide-brimmed woman outside. He chuckled, “It is indeed a bit much.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 618: The Reasoning of Chen Ping'an and Qi Jinglong

A solitary boat drifted down the river, cutting through the gentle rain and slanted wind. An elderly fisherman, clad in a bamboo hat and green raincoat, sat at the bow, lifting a wine jug to his lips. Behind him, two stunning songstresses, dressed in thin garments, sat gracefully; one cradled a pipa, playing a melodic tune, while the other held a red clapper, her voice weaving in harmony. Though the sounds seemed chaotic at first, they formed a beautiful, ordered symphony.

The trio on the small boat were all practitioners of the Dao.

A Qi practitioner swept across the river on the wind, casually summoning a magical tool that glimmered like a white ribbon as it hurtled toward the boat. He shouted, “Shut up already! What a pompous display! You could drink the whole river dry without spending a dime!”

To this, the old fisherman merely raised his arm and lightly shook his sleeve. The furious white ribbon not only failed to capsize the boat but instead vanished into the fisherman’s sleeve, buzzing momentarily before falling silent.

The Qi practitioner, looking utterly defeated, suddenly halted mid-air and pleaded, “Old immortal, return my flying sword!”

The old fisherman snickered, “Kneel and beg me.”

Without further ado, the Qi practitioner landed on the river’s surface, using the water as ground, and began to pound his forehead three times, splashing water everywhere.

The small boat sped away like an arrow. After the foolish practitioner finished his three bows, the old fisherman finally flicked his sleeve and tossed out a snow-white sword pellet, lightly grasping it before tossing it backward.

After retrieving the sword pellet, the sword practitioner sped away for quite a distance before bursting into laughter, “Old man, if those two young ladies were your daughters, I’d happily become your son-in-law. One is not enough, but two is just right…”

One of the young women holding the pipa coldly scoffed, plucking the strings with force, her movements like a tempest.

Suddenly, the river behind the boat erupted, forming a massive fissure that extended toward the sword practitioner. Sensing the danger, the practitioner hurriedly ascended into the air, trying to distance himself from the river. He didn’t expect the woman with the red clapper to gently raise her hand and lightly clap. A massive red clapper manifestation, resembling a mountain, descended from the rain-soaked sky, smashing directly onto the sword practitioner, forcefully plunging him into the river. It wasn’t until the small boat had drifted ten miles away that the unfortunate sword practitioner managed to crawl ashore, gasping for breath and not daring to say another word to the trio on the boat.

Due to the rain, Sui Jingcheng had taken shelter in a water pavilion. After pondering for a moment, she decided against removing her veil and turned to gaze at the scene of the carefree fisherman on the river. As for the duel of the immortals, having experienced two life-and-death crises, Sui Jingcheng had little emotional investment in it.

Chen Ping'an merely glanced at the river's surface before retracting his gaze, realizing it was just very much like North Julu Continent. If this were on Baoping Continent or Tongye Continent, the sword practitioner would not have acted, and even if he did, the fisherman would not have returned the flying sword.

Qi Jinglong, however, lingered with his gaze fixed on the river, perhaps quietly waiting for the rain to stop before bidding farewell.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Mr. Liu, as a sword practitioner, why do you ponder human affairs so deeply? Won't it hinder your cultivation?”

Qi Jinglong nodded, “Of course it will. This is where I differ from the other two. My aptitude is similar to theirs; though our opportunities differ, in the end, it comes down to being distracted. One of them even advised me to think less about worldly matters and focus on cultivating my swordsmanship. Once I reach the upper five realms, I can consider those matters again.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “What is gained or lost today may just be a loss or gain tomorrow.”

Qi Jinglong chuckled and nodded, “I’ll take your good words.”

Chen Ping'an asked earnestly, “Is it your own feelings that lead you to ponder these worldly affairs, Mr. Liu?”

Qi Jinglong replied, “I come from humble beginnings, a wealthy merchant family. However, I’ve loved reading miscellaneous books since childhood. Once I ascended the mountain, it was hard to change that habit. The path of cultivation can be quite lonely, and one has to find something to do. Moreover, as a practitioner, I have certain advantages—like an improved memory and no worries about the cost of books. Each time I descend the mountain, I make sure to buy some texts to take back with me.”

Chen Ping'an inquired, “Does Mr. Liu have any conclusions about the goodness or wickedness of human hearts?”

Qi Jinglong smiled lightly, “Not yet. To understand the nature of good and evil in human hearts, having a clear line between the two from the start can easily lead to confusion. Thus, the subsequent learning becomes difficult to navigate.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “Exactly. Personal emotions can lead to biases.”

Qi Jinglong continued, “As one's knowledge grows, even a slight bias can evolve from a small stream into a great river that flows into the sea.”

Chen Ping'an smiled knowingly, “Mr. Liu has helped me resolve a doubt.”

Qi Jinglong didn’t press further.

Chen Ping'an stood up, gazing at the rushing river outside the pavilion, a relentless tide that flowed eastward, indifferent to day and night.

This was the reason Chen Ping'an had decided to refine the first day.

Gao Cheng was undoubtedly powerful, belonging to that type of strong practitioner who sought absolute freedom. 

Setting aside Gao Cheng's original intentions, whether it was ambition or desire, Chen Ping'an had noticed an extremely subtle thread in one matter.

Chen Ping'an had once occupied a high seat as a judge of good and evil at the Dragon Palace of Cangjun Lake. Thus, he was even more convinced of one thing, especially after encountering Yang Ningxing at the Bone Marsh. This young Daoist from the Chongxuan Bureau’s Yunzhao Palace manifested as a scholar born from a grain of malicious intent.

Combining the two.

As he repeatedly analyzed the situation, Chen Ping'an became increasingly certain of a conclusion: Gao Cheng was far from the mentality required to become the master of a new Fengdu, at least not yet.

Chen Ping'an certainly wasn’t either, but he could see and guess what that lofty presence should resemble.

A deity, a corpse, devoid of emotion.

Currently, Gao Cheng still had personal likes and dislikes; the city lord of Jingguan City still held resentment and clung to the concept of self.

Even if these were minor feelings, as small as a mustard seed, what of it? They still existed. All these years had passed, yet they remained deeply ingrained in Gao Cheng's mindset.

So, once Gao Cheng became the master of the new Fengdu, a new realm of heaven and earth, this small discrepancy in his mindset could lead to significant deviations as the scale of Fengdu expanded. 

With the passage of time and the increase of ghostly apparitions in Fengdu, these discrepancies would only grow larger, potentially to an infinite extent.

This was what Qi Jinglong meant by a stream becoming a great river.

Perhaps Gao Cheng would have the opportunity to correct those subtle discrepancies when he reached a higher realm.

But that was just “perhaps.”

Moreover, the struggle for the Dao must possess the spirit of such a struggle. If Gao Cheng had failed in the initial contest for the flying sword and hadn’t faced further pursuit or traps, merely showing up and saying that last sentence, Chen Ping'an might have indeed been willing to wait and see, to finish his journey through North Julu Continent before deciding whether to visit the Bone Marsh and Jingguan City.

Chen Ping'an believed that only two people had the best chance of accomplishing such a thing.

On Tongye Continent, the old master of the Guandao Academy. Not even Junzi Zhong Kui, at least not for now.

On Baoping Continent, Cui Yan. Not even Cui Dongshan.

And those two, coincidentally, were close to Chen Ping'an. He felt no fondness at all for the first two.

Was this not the helplessness of worldly matters?

If not friends, then everything was good. If not enemies, then everything was wrong.

Should friends' mistakes be advised against? Should enemies' good be learned from? It's all about cultivating the heart; both on the mountain and off.

As for how to advise or learn, that is even more about cultivating the heart and knowledge. Otherwise, if one advises and turns into an enemy, or learns from the other party, how can one talk about cultivating the heart?

The rain gradually eased.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Mr. Liu, can you accompany us for a while longer?”

Qi Jinglong nodded, “Of course.”

Before departing from the water pavilion, Chen Ping'an asked, “So, Mr. Liu, is your avoidance of the discussion of good and evil to ultimately come closer to the essence of good and evil?”

Qi Jinglong smiled, “Correct.”

Chen Ping'an performed a courteous bow to the North Julu Continent practitioner he had just met.

If Confucius were here and heard of the reasoning this man had drawn for himself, he would surely be pleased.

Even though Qi Jinglong was not a descendant of Confucianism.

Qi Jinglong quickly rose and reciprocated the bow.

Chen Ping'an lifted his head, looking at the refined practitioner before him. He hoped that Cao Qinglang from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land could also become like this in the future, even if not entirely the same, just a little resemblance would suffice.

No one needs to become someone else, for it is unattainable, and there is no need to do so.

Just as Chen Ping'an did not wish Pei Qian to become him.

Pei Qian, back in her hometown, studying diligently and growing steadily—what could be wrong with that? Moreover, Pei Qian had already done better than Chen Ping'an had imagined; she had always been learning the meaning of propriety.

Chen Ping'an never thought of Pei Qian as leisurely wasting her time.

Afraid of hardship, afraid of the pain of training? It didn’t matter.

As a master who had once been the strongest of the five realms, he could strive for the strongest of the six realms!

Once the martial fortune was at hand, the master would gift this pioneering disciple, and Pei Qian wouldn’t be any less adept at both studying and martial arts.

Sui Jingcheng gazed at the somewhat unfamiliar senior.

When the senior and half a protector taught her how to navigate the world, she would learn from others’ experiences. Yet, she found that the senior preferred the latter.

Sui Jingcheng felt a hint of sadness.

Originally believing that the distant senior had come a little closer, she realized that the senior had been sprinting along the path of cultivation while she had been slowly progressing.

One day, she would no longer even be able to see his back.

Even if they reunited after a long separation, what could they talk about when they stood together again?

Sui Jingcheng didn’t know.

The distance to Longtou Ferry was still some way off as the three walked slowly.

Chen Ping'an asked about the situation in Dazhuan Capital.

Qi Jinglong said, “It’s like the calm before a storm; Jianxian Ji Yue from the Yanta Mountain has yet to clash with the ten-realm martial artist stationed at Dazhuan’s Martial Fortune. Once the battle begins, it will be tremendous in scale. So much so that even the scholars from the academy have departed, inviting several experts to observe the fight to prevent collateral damage to the common folk. As for the life or death of the two, that’s not our concern.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Are there any significant updates from the Dali Dynasty on Baoping Continent?”

Qi Jinglong sighed, “The Dali cavalry continues southward, and there have been some reversals in the rear. Many righteous individuals from the nations that have been destroyed are rising in rebellion, bravely sacrificing themselves. This is commendable; no one can criticize that. However, many innocent citizens have died, which is wrong. Although both sides have their reasons, such tragic events are inevitable, after all…”

Chen Ping'an spoke, “It’s unfortunate.”

Qi Jinglong nodded.

Qi Jinglong recalled something and smiled, “Our North Julu Continent's Xie Tianjun has already accepted three challenges.”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and shook his head, “It’s hard to lose.”

Qi Jinglong said, “Indeed, he has never lost. After all, Qi Tianjun from the Shengaizong on Baoping Continent is destined not to make a move. In the three encounters, the earlier challenge from the Sword Immortal Wei Jin at the Wind and Snow Temple was the most noteworthy. Although Wei Jin lost, this young sword practitioner will certainly achieve great heights in the future! However, I’ve heard he has gone to the Upside-Down Mountain to practice his sword at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Thus, I believe that such a sword practitioner achieving higher accomplishments is a good thing.”

Chen Ping'an smiled.

Qi Jinglong curiously asked, “Have you met him?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Once.”

At that time, Wei Jin’s gaze toward Chen Ping'an had been quite indifferent.

Yet, Chen Ping'an still believed he was a good person and a sword immortal. As the years passed, he had come to understand Wei Jin's strength even more.

Qi Jinglong fell silent for a moment. “By the way, there's another significant matter. Besides the Cloud-Peaking Mountain, the other four peaks of the Dali have all been officially sealed.”

Chen Ping'an’s heart stirred.

Refining the life item belonging to the five elements.

Cui Dongshan had brought back five large bags of the multicolored soil from the Dali mountains.

Accumulating earth forms mountains; once the refining succeeds, a harmonious landscape can be established.

Many choices on the path of life can change.

Much like the matter of refining the multicolored soil of Dali Mountains, which Chen Ping'an had originally been the first to give up on. However, after two heartfelt talks with Cui Dongshan and Cui Yan, he became exceptionally resolute. Even on the intercontinental ferry to North Julu Continent, after seeing that vicious woman who had turned from the Dali Queen into the Dali Empress, Chen Ping'an still did not change his mind.

Now, two choices lay before Chen Ping'an: one was to ride the ferry at Longtou and escort Sui Jingcheng to the Bone Marsh’s Pima Sect to refine the multicolored soil. This was stable but time-consuming.

The other was to find a spirit-rich inn nearby at Longtou Ferry, or slightly detour to a secluded mountain glade, and enter seclusion.

Qi Jinglong seemed to sense Chen Ping'an's shifting thoughts. After some hesitation, he smiled and said, “I came down the mountain this time just to chat with you. After our conversation, I find myself rather free.”

Some people, while helping others, tend to think even more.

Chen Ping'an was no different.

Knowledge connects, and people resemble each other.

This is the bond among fellow practitioners.

Thus, Chen Ping'an, shedding his caution, asked, “If I say I want to refine a life item at Longtou Ferry and need someone to guard me, would you be willing, Mr. Liu?”

Qi Jinglong smiled, “I can.”

Chen Ping'an added, “There may be quite a commotion during the refining process. Moreover, I have some enemies in North Julu Continent, such as the Jinlin Palace of the Dazhuan Dynasty.”

Qi Jinglong replied, “Minor matters.”

Chen Ping'an clapped Qi Jinglong on the shoulder, “It's a pity that someone like you doesn’t love to drink.”

Qi Jinglong helplessly stated, “Encouraging drinking is a very damaging thing to one’s character.”

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but laugh, “This line, you should share with an old gentleman later, if there's an opportunity, there’s also a swordsman.”

Qi Jinglong shook his head.

Upon arriving at Longtou Ferry, they settled into a spirit-rich inn named “Emerald Kingfisher.”

Chen Ping'an, rarely extravagant, directly requested a top-tier suite, which surprisingly came with a lotus pond, with lotus leaves as large as plates. After the rain, droplets of dew glistened like pearls, and a gentle breeze carried the fragrance, refreshing the spirit.

Every time Qi Jinglong descended the mountain, he would use a pseudonym and disguise himself in bustling places.

Now, Qi Jinglong moved a long bench to sit by the lotus pond. Sui Jingcheng followed suit, taking off her veil and moving a bench over, holding a walking stick, settling down nearby to begin her breathing exercises.

A small boat was tied by the pond.

Qi Jinglong quietly gazed at the lotus pond, his hands gently clenched into fists resting on his knees.

Chen Ping'an had already begun his seclusion.

Qi Jinglong was a Nascent Soul practitioner and also a lineage instructor. Aside from reading and understanding, Qi Jinglong had a deep familiarity with the process of entering seclusion. 

No matter how great the commotion Chen Ping'an made within, it would not escape this house even a little.

After all, Qi Jinglong was a sword practitioner.

As the rain began to fall again, this time it seemed likely to become a downpour.

Sui Jingcheng, feeling somewhat uneasy, broke her breathing and exhaled a breath of foul air, her brows furrowed.

Qi Jinglong pretended not to notice.

Sui Jingcheng murmured, “I’ve heard a local saying: ‘In minor heat, the rain is like silver; in major heat, the rain is like gold.’”

She continued to talk to herself, “I think such words must be from a scholar, and certainly from one who isn’t very well-read and hasn’t become a significant official.”

Qi Jinglong finally spoke, “That makes sense.”

Sui Jingcheng stood up, propping her walking stick against the long bench, squatting by the lotus pond, asking, “Can the lotus leaves in the pond be freely picked?”

Qi Jinglong nodded, “Having spent so much snowflake money to stay here, picking a few lotus leaves isn’t an issue. However, the spiritual energy contained in the lotus leaves is thin, and they won’t retain their vitality once picked.”

Sui Jingcheng plucked a lotus leaf from the waterside, returned to the long bench, and gently twisted it, splashing droplets everywhere.

Qi Jinglong said, “Mr. Chen has already built up his aura; the refining should be no problem.”

Sui Jingcheng turned and asked, “Is it truly foolproof?”

Qi Jinglong was at a loss. How was he to respond to such a question?

Sui Jingcheng turned her head, softly asking, “Senior, are you really that young?”

Qi Jinglong gazed into the distance, smiling, “As for my real age, I am indeed young. Yet, in terms of mental age, I am not so young. The world has countless peculiarities, especially the blessed lands, where the passage of time is ever so strange and uneven, unlike the ordinary world. So, when that Mr. Chen claims to be three hundred years old, it is not entirely a lie.”

The downpour arrived suddenly.

Sui Jingcheng retrieved her veil and raincoat and simply sat by the pond, letting the rain drench her.

As for Qi Jinglong, there was no need to manipulate his aura; the rain could not touch him.

With his heart stirred, his sword intent moved, drawing forth the sword aura within.

Raindrops the size of soybeans pelted the lotus leaf where Sui Jingcheng had placed her long bench, producing crisp sounds.

Suddenly, Sui Jingcheng’s eyes widened, as she faintly saw a pair of colorful mandarin ducks hiding beneath the lotus leaves in the distance.

Sui Jingcheng’s mood instantly brightened.

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “Those are spiritual birds sold by the Spring Dew Garden in the Jia Mu Mountain Range, not ordinary mandarin ducks. They are temperamental and are raised in the mountains and marshes to guard precious fish in the pond, preventing them from being snatched away by mountain beasts.”

That was quite a damper.

Sui Jingcheng’s mood took a downturn once more.

Although Qi Jinglong was puzzled, not understanding what had displeased her, he knew he had misspoken and ceased further conversation.

By deep night, Sui Jingcheng had returned to her room, but the lights remained on all night.

Qi Jinglong remained seated on the long bench by the water, motionless.

Occasionally, the ripples of his aura would spill out, only to be shattered by the sword aura and return to the heavens.

As for Chen Ping'an inside the house, preparing to refine materials and moving out many treasures, Qi Jinglong certainly wouldn’t allow anyone to casually probe with their divine sense.

For practitioners, refining a life item was of utmost importance—related to life and death.

By noon the next day, Chen Ping'an emerged from his room, his face pale.

Qi Jinglong sighed.

Was it truly that exaggerated for a practitioner of the lower five realms to refine a life item? 

No matter the quality of the refining furnace or the rarity of the materials, or the difficulty of the refining process, was it truly so extraordinary? 

He wasn’t a bottleneck practitioner in the Dragon Gate realm striving for the Golden Core stage!

Qi Jinglong laughed and asked, “Care for a drink to calm your nerves?”

“Let’s hold off on that for now,” Chen Ping'an replied, spotting a vacant long bench by the lotus pond. He sat down and smiled, “It's fine. I’m prepared, and I still have two chances.”

He casually picked up a lotus leaf that had fallen from the long bench due to the rain.

Qi Jinglong pointed to his chest, “The key is here. Don’t have any problems, or else the so-called two chances, no matter how many treasures you have, will be in vain.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Of course. This is something I can handle.”

Seeing him without a trace of despondency, Qi Jinglong felt relieved.

Sui Jingcheng stepped out of her room, only to find her previous spot occupied. Chen Ping'an shifted over, allowing her to sit at the other end of the bench.

Chen Ping'an remarked, “If picking lotus leaves incurs extra costs, it should be noted down.”

Sui Jingcheng laughed, “Sure, it’s just a few snowflake coins. Not a problem at all.”

Chen Ping'an turned to Qi Jinglong.

Qi Jinglong remained indifferent.

You two can be affectionate; don’t involve me. 

Chen Ping'an had to explain, “Mr. Liu, you’ve misunderstood.”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “Alright, let’s say I’ve misunderstood.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, taking out the Sword Nurturing Gourd to drink quietly.

He suddenly recalled something, “The three practitioners we saw on the river earlier—are they famous in North Julu Continent?”

Qi Jinglong replied, “Like that Sword Venerable who used to enjoy nurturing flying swords, he is one of the ten oddities of North Julu Continent. He loves music and has collected many musical instruments and magical treasures, with a quirky temper, wandering from place to place. Many celebrations of the various sects in North Julu Continent, such as the opening of peaks or the success of major practitioners, are considered fortunate if they can invite a dozen masters to play music at the banquet. The last gathering of masters was invited by the youngest sect leader in the history of North Julu Continent, appearing at a small cave sky behind Qingya Cliff of the Qingliang Sect.”

Chen Ping'an nodded.

About an incense stick's time later, Chen Ping'an returned to his room without a word.

Sui Jingcheng had nothing to do, continuing to twist the still lush lotus leaf.

Qi Jinglong said, “Do you mind if I speak about matters related to your Dao cultivation? It’s not that I intend to pry, it’s just that your breathing and aura fluctuations feel somewhat familiar.”

Sui Jingcheng shook her head, “I do mind.”

Yet, she turned her head, glancing at the house, softly saying, “Mr. Liu, go ahead.”

Qi Jinglong smiled, “The method of breathing you practice is quite similar to that of the direct disciple of the Fire Dragon True Man, the Yuanshi of Tai Xia, Li Yu.”

Sui Jingcheng frowned, “Mr. Liu, wait a moment. Although I don’t know many of the mountain rules, having traveled this far with my senior, I understand that Daoist true men are usually only at the Earth Immortal level, while the Yuanjun must be at least in the upper five realms of the Jade Purity level. Is Li Yu’s aptitude truly that superior, surpassing her master by much?”

Qi Jinglong shook his head with a smile, “This is some amusing gossip from our North Julu Continent. That Fire Dragon True Man is an external surname celestial master from the Central God Continent’s Longhu Mountain. There are some rumors… never mind, it’s not something I should casually mention. Anyway, that old immortal has a very high realm, extremely high, yet he still holds onto the title of true man. He is said to enjoy sleeping, cultivating and understanding the Dao in his dreams, which is quite mysterious. Li Yu is one of the direct disciples of the Fire Dragon True Man. Due to the old immortal’s whimsical selection of disciples, regardless of aptitude or roots, he takes one or two back with him every time he descends, even accepting some old friends as disciples, leading to a long list of direct disciples in the ancestral hall’s lineage chart—there are as many as forty or fifty. Over the long years, there have been those like Li Yu who ascended to the status of a Daoist Yuanjun, but many have died stuck at various bottlenecks, from the Cave Abode realm to the Nascent Soul realm, quite a few. Now, there are still more than twenty direct disciples on the mountain continuing their cultivation, making for a wide range of ages and realms among practitioners of the same generation. However, this Tai Xia Yuanjun has been in seclusion for many years, and her lineage has branched out, with her disciples on the mountain being the most numerous. The three generations of disciples after her already number over a hundred.”

Sui Jingcheng’s complexion shifted slightly.

Her senior had once deciphered the inscription on the three golden hairpins, one of which mentioned “Tai Xia Subduing Ghosts”!

Sui Jingcheng quickly steadied her mind.

Internally, she began to wrestle with herself.

Qi Jinglong glanced at Sui Jingcheng, his gaze complex. It was better not to speak of some things; the outcome was best left for Chen Ping'an to worry about.

The roots of Sui Jingcheng’s Dao were not so simple, suggesting she might well be a disciple favored by the Tai Xia Yuanjun, and the possibility was both great and small. This was because Li Yu had already taken an apprentice with exceptional roots before closing the life-and-death great barrier, and although she was still under forty years old, she was already a candidate for the next generation of the youngest ten in North Julu Continent.

Among mountain practitioners, the higher the peak, the more serious they are about matters of master-disciple relationships.

Moreover, the hidden complexities within Sui Jingcheng—that Mr. Chen wasn’t a true Earth Immortal sword practitioner—had yet to be uncovered. However, this didn’t have to be a bad thing.

Regardless, with Sui Jingcheng’s faint sword intent, Qi Jinglong had roughly deduced a trace of clues. This method of cultivation was perilous and could lead to trouble. If handled improperly, it could affect the foundation of the Dao.

Qi Jinglong could even follow this thread and deduce more conclusions based on the complex relationships among the great practitioners of North Julu Continent.

Yet many mountain matters are known but not spoken of.

As for that Yuanjun's little disciple, Gu Mo, Qi Jinglong had encountered her during his travels; her aptitude was indeed excellent, though her temper was not so great.

The Tai Xia lineage had always been this way.

Descending the mountain to slay demons and eliminate evil, unafraid of heaven or earth—what was death if it came? 

As long as there was reason, they would face off against practitioners two or three realms higher than themselves. The histories recorded instances of Earth Immortal practitioners or even sword immortals in the upper five realms casually killing those lesser Daoist practitioners who were unaware. Most thought they could remain undetected, but without exception, many were met with deadly retribution from the Tai Xia Yuanjun or her fellow disciples.

In the thousand years of history, the Fire Dragon True Man had descended the mountain twice: once casually killing a twelfth-realm martial practitioner and once directly slaying a twelfth-realm sword immortal who thought himself invulnerable—throughout both encounters, the old true man emerged unscathed, and what should have been a world-shaking clash in the mountain passed without a ripple.

Day and night replaced one another.

When Chen Ping'an stepped out of his room for the second time, Sui Jingcheng immediately followed suit.

Qi Jinglong did not speak this time.

Chen Ping'an remained seated on the long bench. The lotus leaf he had placed there had begun to show signs of wilting as its spiritual energy dissipated.

Sui Jingcheng did not sit on the bench, merely standing a short distance away.

She stood elegantly like a hibiscus flower.

Chen Ping'an, holding the Sword Nurturing Gourd, sipped wine and smiled, “Don’t worry.”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “If you’re not worried, what should I be worried about?”

Chen Ping'an turned and said, “I appreciate your help.”

Qi Jinglong’s response was succinct, “No need to be polite.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Mr. Liu, do you have your own understanding of the Buddhist concept of subduing the heart’s monkey?”

Qi Jinglong shook his head, “Superficial understanding, hardly worth mentioning. If I have deeper thoughts in the future, I will share them with you.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I once met an enlightened monk, so I have some thoughts. Mind if I share?”

Qi Jinglong smiled, “This is the best kind of interaction.”

Chen Ping'an stood up, extending a hand, his fingers curled like a hook, unmoving as if restraining something, “Does this count as subduing?”

Qi Jinglong pondered for a moment and shook his head, “If it began this way, it would definitely not be. If it’s an end result, it wouldn’t be complete either.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, then squatted down and pressed his finger against the bluestone ground by the lotus pond, lightly drawing two very faint lines, then sketching out lines in all directions.

Finally, he extended his hand and wiped over the marks, but did not erase them completely, leaving behind fragmented, faint scratches.

Qi Jinglong asked, “Is this our mind? The heart’s monkey and intentions gallop in all directions, seemingly returning to the original heart, but if one isn’t careful, there will still be traces left behind, not truly wiped clean?”

Chen Ping'an said nothing, instead reaching into the pond with his right hand to scoop up a small handful of water, standing near the central point, then using his left hand to gently extract a drop of water, letting it fall at the center.

Qi Jinglong focused his gaze.

Then he squatted down, lightly wiping with one hand.

On the bluestone floor, it appeared as though no water stains remained; yet within some fine scratches, delicate water trails continued to spread outwards, varying in length and distance.

Chen Ping'an turned his head and smiled, “Mr. Liu is correct.”

Qi Jinglong contemplated, “But is it true that when the heart’s monkey runs rampant, it will always leave traces behind? What if it’s more like the footprints in the snow, completely melting away once the sun rises?”

Then both fell into silence.

Sui Jingcheng squatted nearby, wide-eyed, trying to discern something.

Otherwise, remaining in such a fog would be quite embarrassing, wouldn’t it?

When she raised her head, she found her senior glancing at her.

Sitting on the long bench, she adopted an expression of “I should know everything.”

Chen Ping'an slapped his forehead, tossing the water from his hand, twisting his wrist to produce a page of blue paper scripture, standing up and handing it to Qi Jinglong, “I don’t recognize Sanskrit, could you see which Buddhist scripture this is from?”

After receiving the scripture, Qi Jinglong smiled, “A chapter? This is an entire Buddhist text.”

Chen Ping'an was taken aback, sitting down beside him.

Qi Jinglong thought for a moment, “As for the content, I’ll tell you more later. When the opportunity arises for you to enter a temple, you can ask the monks yourself. Remember to keep it safe.”

Chen Ping'an stored away that page… that Buddhist scripture.

Suddenly, he burst into laughter, “Well, even though I don’t recognize the characters, I can still copy it down to calm my mind.”

Qi Jinglong nodded.

Chen Ping'an stood up, preparing to head towards the house to transcribe.

Sui Jingcheng hesitated.

Chen Ping'an said, “It’s fine.”

Sui Jingcheng's eyes reddened.

Chen Ping'an said seriously, “Don’t think you can get away with this.”

Sui Jingcheng shot him a glare, twisting her waist to sit on the long bench.

Qi Jinglong kept his gaze forward, blinking; he thought to himself, this Mr. Chen is quite a master.

Could it be possible for him to seek guidance from him as well?

After all, among his peers both inside and outside the sect, many female practitioners had gazes that made Qi Jinglong feel somewhat guilty.

This was the trouble with reasoning everywhere.

It wouldn't affect the cultivation of the Dao or the clarity of the sword heart, but ultimately, it was many regrets that arose because of himself. He had no issues, but they had.

This was not good.

That day, after Chen Ping'an finished copying the scripture, he continued his seclusion, preparing to ignite the furnace for the final refinement of the Dali Mountains’ five-colored soil.

This would be the last time refining the five-colored soil of Dali Mountains.

That night, Qi Jinglong was meditating with his eyes closed.

Sui Jingcheng sat in a daze.

Qi Jinglong opened his eyes, turned, and softly chided, “What’s with the distraction? The essence of the Dao is crucial. What does it matter to trust others once, can one not be solitary every time?”

The slightly chaotic ripples from the house returned to calm.

Sui Jingcheng felt a bit anxious, “Is there an enemy approaching? Is it the Jinlin Palace’s celestial being?”

Qi Jinglong shook his head, but said nothing more.

A white rainbow of sword light and a dazzling streak of radiant mist swept through the sky from the horizon, a momentum great enough to shock the entire Longtou Ferry in Lvying Kingdom.

Almost all the practitioners in the inns glanced up, and those strolling or chatting in the courtyards quickly returned to their rooms.

The sword light landed on the opposite bank of the lotus pond, while the radiant mist settled upon the lotus leaves.

Gu Mo, the disciple of Tai Xia Yuanjun Li Yu, donned a unique Daoist robe of the external surname celestial master from Longhu Mountain, embroidered with blooming red clouds that swirled and shone brilliantly.

The other was an exceptional Nascent Soul sword practitioner, yet not one of the Qi practitioners from the Fire Dragon True Man’s mountain.

As expected.

Qi Jinglong understood.

Mountain practitioners, especially female practitioners, also had their own “female friends” in their circles.

Tai Xia Yuanjun was no exception.

Hence, the absence of that female sword immortal from the central part of North Julu Continent to the Upside-Down Mountain could now be explained.

It was likely she was waiting for her friend Li Yu to successfully emerge from seclusion before acting.

Upon seeing Qi Jinglong, Gu Mo, due to the difference in realms, did not recognize this “Earth Dragon Liu Jinglong.”

However, the Nascent Soul sword practitioner saw through the disguise, smiling, “Greetings, Liu Jun.”

Floating Duck Sword Lake, hosted by Li Cai.

Sui Jingcheng felt somewhat strange; why did she feel a sense of familiarity and closeness upon meeting this sword practitioner who introduced herself as from Floating Duck Sword Lake? She shook her head, trying to dispel that inexplicable emotional ripple within her, shifting her steps to stand even closer behind Qi Jinglong.

Upon seeing this scene, Rong Chang couldn’t help but chuckle softly, saying nothing more. It was only reasonable to remain oblivious and avoid complicating things further, lest he inadvertently disrupt the Dao.

However, after reuniting with her long-lost friend, Rong Chang felt a weight in his heart.

Originally, Sui Jingcheng’s path of cultivation wouldn’t have been so convoluted.

But no one had anticipated the Tai Xia Yuanjun, who had a high chance of success in the life-and-death barrier, would have an extraordinary relationship with a great practitioner who had already perished.

Thus, this journey south, as Li Yu’s most cherished disciple, Gu Mo’s mood had been utterly dismal. In several demon-infested caves that had caused trouble for many years, she had to rely on her master’s thunder methods to create landslides. On one occasion, had it not been for Rong Chang’s timely intervention, she would have faced a dire situation, particularly as she had been up against a demon of the Nascent Soul realm in a frenzied state. Thus, although injured, Gu Mo still pressed on, first visiting the Five Tombs Kingdom and then tracing her way back to Longtou Ferry in Lvying Kingdom, remaining too preoccupied to rest. After two unsuccessful attempts to persuade her, Rong Chang had to give up; after all, Gu Mo was not one of his sect's disciples.

Upon learning of the Tai Xia Yuanjun’s demise, Rong Chang promptly sent a message using a flying sword to the designated location agreed upon with his master at Baoping Continent’s Shujian Lake.

Soon after, his master sent a flying sword back to Floating Duck Sword Lake, demanding that he ensure the safety of that girl, leaving no room for any accidents; otherwise, he would be held accountable.

Rong Chang was acutely aware of his master Li Cai’s temperament; this was not mere bluster.

His master’s temperament was quite straightforward; one need not guess at all. For instance, when it came to Rong Chang’s failure to ascend to the upper five realms, Li Cai would look at him with evident displeasure. Each time they met, he would teach him a lesson. Even if Rong Chang were merely traveling on his sword, as long as he happened to cross paths with his master who was enjoying the scenery, he would be struck down with a sword.

After all, this was a significant matter.

Gu Mo, though in a terrible mood, still adhered to the prior agreement with Rong Chang and spoke to Sui Jingcheng, “You are Sui Jingcheng, right? You are a recognized disciple of my master, Tai Xia Yuanjun. From now on, you will have a protector, which is me, Gu Mo. But rest assured, aside from teaching you a sword-control technique, you can freely wander, both up the mountain and through the waters. No one will restrain you, nor will I. The bamboo robes you wear will officially belong to you from now on. However, you must return the ‘Tai Xia Subduing Ghosts’ from the three golden hairpins. The sect has its arrangements for you, but I will exchange it for something of equivalent value; it will not be inferior.”

As for Liu Jinglong, since he had cast a disguise, Gu Mo simply acted as though she did not see him and did not recognize him.

It was said that he was a practitioner of high cultivation, with excellent talent, and immensely famous, but exceedingly finicky.

Gu Mo did not wish to engage in pleasantries with him.

Interpersonal relationships?

Among the Tai Xia lineage, that only applied to those who had fought side by side as fellow practitioners. Even if you were merely a practitioner of the lower five realms, you could become an esteemed guest on the mountain. Beyond that, even if you were a practitioner of the upper five realms, what did it matter to me?

Sui Jingcheng froze for a moment, gritted her teeth, and cautiously asked, “May I go see Baoping Continent?”

Standing upon the lotus leaf, Gu Mo glanced back at Rong Chang.

Rong Chang smiled and said, “It’s best to stay in North Julu Continent.”

Because, barring any mishaps, Master Li Cai would be on his way back to North Julu Continent.

Sui Jingcheng quickly produced the three golden hairpins, “I can return all three golden hairpins to you. If possible, I would like to follow a senior to cultivate. I mean, if it’s possible. But if Tai Xia Yuanjun doesn’t agree, I’m still willing to remain a recognized disciple. Could I just finish a trip to Baoping Continent? I will return to North Julu Continent myself and apologize to Yuanjun…”

Gu Mo was furious, “Stop with the nonsense!”

Rong Chang found himself in a bit of a dilemma.

What Sui Jingcheng said was without any faults, but it struck a chord with Gu Mo.

The demise of a Yuanjun was a huge misfortune for any sect, especially for Gu Mo, who was a direct disciple of Li Yu.

Qi Jinglong sighed inwardly, surmising that there must have been a significant problem with the Tai Xia Yuanjun.

Yet Qi Jinglong remained calm, saying, “Let’s discuss this properly.”

Gu Mo's expression was frigid as she glared at Qi Jinglong, “You, an outsider, have the right to butt in?!”

Qi Jinglong maintained his usual expression, “I have a friend who is currently refining a life item and is at a critical stage. Both Miss Gu and Sword Immortal Rong should be aware of this. So could we perhaps sit down and discuss this at length?”

Sui Jingcheng nodded vigorously, maintaining her outstretched hand, her palm open, holding the three golden hairpins.

Rong Chang suddenly frowned.

He hoped it wouldn’t be that tragedy!

That was a seemingly innocuous yet extremely entangled obstacle in the mountain.

If the Tai Xia Yuanjun’s failure in seclusion had indeed affected this girl’s chance at cultivation, and if this current girl were to fall into calamity again, it would be a huge problem on top of a huge problem.

If that were the case, Rong Chang could not sit idly by.

The slightest ripple in the heart lake could be suppressed early on, but once allowed to fester, like a pond turning into a lotus field, how would one sever it? 

Severing it might harm the foundation of the Dao, wouldn’t it?

Qi Jinglong sighed, speaking softly, “The Dao is difficult to walk, and rushing only leads to setbacks. Shouldn’t we think more carefully? Waiting a while longer doesn’t seem like a burden to you, does it?”

Gu Mo sneered, “An hour or half a day?”

Qi Jinglong frowned slightly, still maintaining a pleasant demeanor, “I sincerely ask both of you to wait until my friend completes his refining. Then the three of us can discuss this. It’s better to untie the knot with the person who tied it; perhaps we can find a clearer path than making hasty decisions now.”

Rong Chang felt that what Qi Jinglong said was not wrong.

However, the tricky part was that to untie the knot, the person who tied it must be willing to do so. If that person were to be ungrateful and unwilling to unravel the situation, it would just agitate the current girl’s mindset, pulling the rope tighter, and the bell would become even more difficult to untangle.

Thus, Rong Chang felt quite troubled.

Gu Mo scoffed, “What, relying on your noble lineage and high cultivation, you think you’re justified? I can't understand. What right does an outsider have to dictate things here? Aren’t you embarrassed?”

Qi Jinglong shook his head, “Currently, we find ourselves in a cycle of entanglement. If you truly care for Sui Jingcheng’s journey, shouldn’t you listen to her voice? How can you be sure that your good intentions won’t lead to missteps? As things stand, with so many hidden dangers, there’s no escape; there’s no way to avoid it. I believe when my friend emerges from his room, he will listen to your reason. If it turns out that indeed Miss Sui's reasoning is too small, and my reasoning is too biased, that would be best. However, if not, we can still negotiate a countermeasure. Only when all three sides clarify these connections can we truly untie this knot and resolve our hearts…”

Gu Mo shouted, “Liu Jinglong, are you not tired?! Do we really need you to direct our affairs here? She can just hand over the hairpins and leave with us from Longtou Ferry. She can go anywhere in North Julu Continent!”

Sui Jingcheng turned her head to glance at the house, taking a deep breath, saying, “I can leave with you.”

Qi Jinglong suddenly turned and smiled, “Are you worried about implicating Mr. Chen? Or have you truly changed your mind?”

Sui Jingcheng’s eyes glistened with unshed tears, tightly grasping the three golden hairpins in her hand.

Qi Jinglong nodded and asked, “Then if I say that as long as I, Qi Jinglong, stand here, your seniors can rest assured while refining their life items, what’s your decision? This time, I can give you a definitive answer. I can guarantee that whatever happens inside Mr. Chen’s house—whether it succeeds or fails, I dare not make any claims. However, as for the affairs outside the house tonight, with me here, it is absolutely foolproof.”

With tears in her eyes, Sui Jingcheng murmured, “Even if I truly have to leave, I want to say goodbye to my senior. But I’m still afraid…”

Qi Jinglong turned around, smiling brightly, “What are you afraid of? Do you think Mr. Chen and Mr. Liu’s reasoning can’t feed you?”

Sui Jingcheng’s expression became anxious.

Qi Jinglong shook his head, “To refrain from doing something is to enable oneself to do something.”

Qi Jinglong gazed at the furious Gu Mo, “I know Miss Gu isn’t a reckless and unreasonable person; it’s just that your heart is currently unstable, which is causing this behavior.”

Qi Jinglong then looked at the Nascent Soul sword practitioner of Floating Duck Sword Lake, “I also know that Sword Immortal Rong has concerns and means well.”

Gu Mo sneered, “Oh? Is it time for a ‘but’?”

Qi Jinglong smiled, shaking his head, “I stand here; that ‘but’ is already implicit and doesn’t need my words.”

Rong Chang contemplated, “Just one question: how about a duel?”

Qi Jinglong nodded, then ceased to look at Rong Chang, directly shifting his gaze to Gu Mo, his expression impassive, “Now it’s your turn.”

Gu Mo found herself utterly shocked, suddenly turning to look.

Rong Chang remained motionless, a bitter smile appearing on his face, “In the battle of Tili Mountain, it seems you both have held back.”

This Floating Duck Sword Lake Nascent Soul sword practitioner was presently as if surrounded by a small world.

That small world was constituted of countless strands of pure sword intent.

Qi Jinglong’s life sword is named “Regulation,” a name deriving from a classic of a former Confucian sage. However, nearly no one in North Julu Continent knew what this strangely named flying sword’s inherent divine abilities were.

Gu Mo gritted her teeth, her complexion pale as fear gripped her, her hands trembling.

Qi Jinglong commanded, “Calm your mind, stabilize your spirit, and cultivate your aura—do not act recklessly!”

Gu Mo felt as though she had received a wake-up call. Taking a deep breath, she stabilized her spirit and looked into the eyes of the blue-clad sword practitioner, complex emotions swirling within her.

At that moment, a young man dressed in blue, identical to Qi Jinglong, emerged from the house, “Sorry to keep you both waiting.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 619: Ascending to the Three Realms

In the Dragon Gate Realm, the cultivator Gu Mo and Rong Chang from the Floating Poppy Sword Lake gazed at the young man who had just emerged from his retreat.

Gu Mo was somewhat surprised. The commotion caused by a lower fifth realm cultivator refining their innate object was far too great; the aura was overwhelmingly strong, which didn’t seem reasonable.

Rong Chang, being a Nascent Soul Sword Cultivator, stood at a higher vantage point, seeing farther and deeper. His expression was not just one of surprise but also of shock.

Qi Jinglong did not turn around; he put away the small world formed by his innate flying sword. When he struck, the flying sword was nowhere to be seen, and when he withdrew, it remained hidden.

“Please forgive my rudeness,” Qi Jinglong said to Rong Chang.

Rong Chang, hailing from the Floating Poppy Sword Lake and having a sword immortal like Li Cai in his sect, found it difficult to feel displeased. He smiled and said, “It’s an honor to witness Mr. Liu’s innate flying sword firsthand. If there’s a chance in the future, let’s find a place to spar freely.”

“Just as long as it’s not on the Chisel Mountain,” Qi Jinglong replied with a smile.

As Chen Pingan stepped beside Qi Jinglong, he passed by Sui Jingcheng and whispered, “Don’t worry.”

Sui Jingcheng felt a sense of peace settle in her heart. It seemed that the presence of a senior was even more reassuring than Mr. Liu’s flying sword.

Even now, she was aware that this senior was merely a lower fifth realm cultivator, and his cultivation level was still temporarily below that of Qi Jinglong.

“Thanks,” Chen Pingan said, standing beside Qi Jinglong.

“If you really want to thank me, don't urge me to drink,” Qi Jinglong replied.

“Fair enough,” Chen Pingan said with a smile.

Then, Qi Jinglong briefly recounted the circumstances leading up to this moment, but the deeper secrets remained unspoken. Chen Pingan had to concentrate entirely on refining his innate object, so he was unaware of the conversation among Qi Jinglong and the others. However, he could still sense the tense atmosphere near the lotus pond, especially at the moment Qi Jinglong summoned his innate flying sword. Even though his mind was deeply immersed in his task, he still clearly perceived the moment, which rather served as a form of reassurance for him.

Turning to Sui Jingcheng, he said, “You should go back to your room. Knowing some things too early might not be beneficial. Mr. Liu and I need to discuss some matters with Miss Gu and Sword Immortal Rong. Remember not to eavesdrop; if it concerns your path, don’t take it lightly.”

Sui Jingcheng nodded and headed straight for her room.

Seeing this, Rong Chang felt a bit heavy-hearted. 

After Sui Jingcheng gently closed her door, Qi Jinglong swiftly set up a sound isolation talisman around the vicinity of her room.

The movement was seamless, as if it were flowing water.

It was as if Chen Pingan had no intention of reminding Qi Jinglong, for when the door closed and the talisman was drawn, he already turned to the two celestial masters who had come looking for Sui Jingcheng, asking, “Can Mr. Liu and I sit down for a chat? The outcome may take a while.”

Gu Mo nodded, “Feel free.”

Chen Pingan sat on a long bench behind Qi Jinglong, who also took a seat, slightly shifting to avoid sitting in the center position again.

From start to finish, Qi Jinglong had simply stood up, spoken reason, drawn his sword, and sheathed it again.

As the two sat down, Rong Chang felt his heart sink again. How could these two young men in blue robes resonate so perfectly in their mindset? Sharing a bench, their seating arrangement signified a certain “you follow my rules, I follow yours” sentiment.

Regarding the “Golden Dan Sword Immortal” named Chen, their pursuit of Sui Jingcheng had led to numerous rumors and scattered news, but beyond that, both Gu Mo and Rong Chang had conducted extensive investigations, only to find the clues to be numerous yet tangled, akin to fog obscuring the truth.

As for Liu Jinglong, there was no need for them to dig deeper. He was the third among the ten young talents of the North Junlu Continent, a rising star of the Taihui Sword Sect.

Now that both sword immortals from the Taihui Sword Sect had gone on distant journeys to the Upside-down Mountain, this posed a dangerous situation for a sect leader, especially in North Junlu, where disagreements could lead to life and death encounters. The sword cultivators formed the backbone of the mountain's power, and they wouldn’t lack for enemies.

However, no one underestimated the Taihui Sword Sect, even without a sword immortal to oversee it. Those with insufficient cultivation levels dared not act; those with sufficient levels were unwilling to engage.

Among the two sword immortals heading to the Sword Qi Great Wall, one was not Liu Jinglong's advocate, while the other, of a higher rank, was also not his protector. The one with a chance to aid him was Liu Jinglong's senior sister, although she had no place among the ten in North Junlu, as she had been stuck at the Golden Dan bottleneck when Liu Jinglong entered the mountains. After he gained fame, she still had not managed to break through. Even though the Taihui Sword Sect kept the news under wraps, whispers circulated that this promising young woman, a Golden Dan sword cultivator, nearly fell into madness, and it was Liu Jinglong who personally intervened, paying a heavy price to help her through her tribulation.

In contrast, Liu Jinglong's advocate was merely an old sword cultivator from the Dragon Gate Realm, who, limited by his aptitude, had long succumbed to the decay of his path and had already passed away.

Looking back, it was indeed a curious affair, but at the time, it made perfect sense, as Liu Jinglong was not a true innate sword talent. After he began his cultivation journey, almost no one in the sect or beyond believed that Liu Jinglong's path could advance so rapidly. Even a sword immortal, who had maintained a friendly relationship with the Taihui Sword Sect for generations, expressed doubts when Liu Jinglong ascended to the cave dwelling realm and became a rare disciple of the ancestral hall. They worried that Liu Jinglong's nature was too soft, fundamentally contradicting the sword principles of the Taihui Sword Sect, making it difficult for him to achieve greatness—especially for someone who could become a pillar of the sect. However, reality proved that the Taihui Sword Sect's exceptional acceptance of Liu Jinglong as a direct disciple was indeed the right choice.

Chen Pingan turned to the female daoist from the Taixia lineage and said, “I’m an outsider; you should have investigated this already. In fact, I come from the Treasure Bottle Continent. The incident with Sui Jingcheng was a coincidence.”

Rong Chang asked, “Could you elaborate?”

Chen Pingan nodded and briefly recounted the events of the incident at the Pavilion of Immortals. As for observing one's heart during cultivation, he kept silence. He said nothing about whether people were good or bad, merely that everyone acted according to their own decisions in the end.

Neither Rong Chang nor Gu Mo, even with Gu Mo’s notoriously bad temper, were concerned that this young man was lying.

Because this young man in the blue robe was sitting next to Liu Jinglong.

Even a fifth realm cultivator could weave lies, and the truth could be uncertain, with plots leading to death without accountability. Yet, Liu Jinglong would never do such a thing.

Thus, anyone who could be Liu Jinglong's friend should also be trustworthy.

This was an unspoken principle, an unwritten rule.

As long as Liu Jinglong sat there, even if he said nothing.

“I previously harbored the worst intentions, thinking you deceived Sui Jingcheng and made her devotedly follow you in cultivation. After all, Sui Jingcheng is rather inexperienced and possesses a precious treasure. Using methods like those of the Golden Scale Palace would have led to a disaster, yet we found out afterward that it was no trouble at all. Instead, it was just like the scene I saw earlier that was most troublesome.”

After listening, Rong Chang candidly replied, “I didn’t expect Mr. Chen to have already guessed the opportunity behind Sui Jingcheng and even provided her with an option that favored us. It seems I underestimated your wisdom.”

Chen Pingan said, “I’ve shared my situation; can you share yours?”

Rong Chang and Gu Mo exchanged glances, both feeling somewhat awkward.

Gu Mo, sitting on the small boat, crossed his legs and, to his surprise, began acting like a shopkeeper, saying, “Sword Immortal Rong, you take over. I’m not good at this roundabout talk; it’s too bothersome.”

Rong Chang felt a bit helpless. In fact, Gu Mo’s behavior wasn’t that she was lacking in loyalty; rather, the matter concerning Sui Jingcheng was originally facilitated by the Taixia Yuanjun, Li Yu, to help her master, the sword immortal Li Cai. To be precise, it was to assist the future master of the Floating Poppy Sword Lake. Li Cai would definitely travel far to the Upside-down Mountain, and the reason for lingering in North Junlu was to await the Taixia Yuanjun's emergence and then jointly head to the Sword Qi Great Wall to slay the great demon. Now, with Li Yu’s unfortunate demise, her master would likely go to the Upside-down Mountain alone. Her master had long decided that the future head of the Floating Poppy Sword Lake would not be Rong Chang, even if he ascended to a higher realm of sword cultivation. It wouldn’t be any of the other experienced elders of the Floating Poppy Sword Lake either, but rather Rong Chang’s junior sister who had already “been in seclusion for thirty years.”

That was the “jade person of the Sui family” from the Wuling Kingdom.

Rong Chang bore no grudges or objections regarding this. He believed all the cultivators of the Floating Poppy Sword Lake felt the same. The reasoning was simple: they feared being struck dead by their master, Li Cai.

The Taixia lineage had Li Yu, who was skilled in several exquisite techniques said to have been passed down from the Fire Dragon Real Person.

Rong Chang’s junior sister was indeed in seclusion at the Floating Poppy Sword Lake, but under the divine powers of Taixia Yuanjun, she had half “reincarnated” as Sui Jingcheng while not damaging Sui Jingcheng’s original soul. It could be said that the Sui Jingcheng within was still the legitimate daughter of the old minister Sui Xinyu, but not entirely. In summary, it was a complex situation that made Rong Chang's head hurt just thinking about it. As for the final outcome, how his junior sister managed to practice swordsmanship through this, Rong Chang was too lazy to ponder further.

His master, Li Cai, had said little back then, seeming to hold back quite a lot. In any case, what Rong Chang needed to do was erase the small mishap surrounding Sui Jingcheng due to the unexpected demise of Taixia Yuanjun, keeping Sui Jingcheng in North Junlu to await her master’s return across the continent. That way, Rong Chang would suffer less punishment when his master returned to the sect. As for what Golden Scale Palace or whatever, things he had never even heard of, Rong Chang considered them unworthy of his sword.

After some contemplation, Rong Chang still preferred to say little. The two young men in blue robes before him enjoyed discussing reason and were adept at it, but if he underestimated their intelligence, it would be foolish. Perhaps if he revealed even a hint of the truth, they might follow the clues to uncover more. The two bystanders might even see deeper than Rong Chang himself. They might not use this to threaten him, but it was certainly not a good thing.

In the Floating Poppy Sword Lake, two things were most undesirable: practicing the sword poorly and being too dull-witted.

However, his master, Li Cai, regarded everyone as a clumsy fool incapable of sword arts.

Whenever his master got angry and hit someone, he couldn’t help but exclaim his catchphrase, “If your brain isn't working, then practice your sword until you drop; how dare you be lazy?”

How does one explain such reasoning?

Thus, after carefully considering his words, Rong Chang said, “Given the circumstances, the key is how to break this deadlock. Sui Jingcheng has evidently fallen for Mr. Chen. Severing feelings with a sharp sword sounds easy, but it’s difficult in practice. Sword cultivators who use emotional attachments as a磨石 (磨石, a whetstone for sharpening) have succeeded, but they are few.”

Chen Pingan nodded in agreement. “That is indeed true.”

In the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, the Spring Tide Palace was rich and abundant, or rather Jiang Shangzhen, who had employed many schemes to help his friend Lu Fang break through emotional barriers. His methods were extreme and ruthless, yet the results weren’t good. Lu Fang ultimately didn’t make it among the top ten, and it wasn’t merely because he lost to Chen Pingan. More importantly, it was because Lu Fang’s heart wasn’t yet complete. Even if he could “ascend” and leave Lotus Flower Blessed Land, it would mean he wasted sixty years.

Rong Chang asked, “This isn’t about placing blame on Mr. Chen; it’s simply discussing the current state. Now that Mr. Chen is entangled, do you want to be the one to untangle it?”

Chen Pingan shook his head. “It’s difficult.”

Rong Chang frowned.

Gu Mo, who was planning to practice silent meditation, couldn’t help but interject, “What attitude is this?! Cultivators who are infatuated with beauty fall to lower tiers, or do you have some grand scheme to become a dao partner with Sui Jingcheng? Well then, that would mean you’re tying yourself to both our Taixia lineage and the Floating Poppy Sword Lake. You really have a good plan!”

Chen Pingan still shook his head. “Not at all.”

Some words were harsh. 

However, being willing to speak them face-to-face was still a sign of good faith.

The truly harsh words always remained in others’ hearts or hid in shadows, whispering insidious words that seemed mild but were actually the most repugnant.

Qi Jinglong also nodded. “It is indeed difficult.”

Chen Pingan suddenly said, “I will only speak of possibilities. Let’s consider two extreme scenarios. In Buddhism, the Eastward journey gradually differentiates between small and great vehicles. A small break of attachment is less than having no attachment at all. If Sui Jingcheng achieves success in her heart, today’s affection may fade into indifference in the coming years, which would truly sever emotional ties. On the other hand, another possibility is that Sui Jingcheng’s emotional root is deep; even if she is thousands of miles away from me, her heart still lingers, and it would be difficult to sever ties when she becomes a sword immortal in the upper fifth realm. There’s also the possibility in between. You two, as high-ranking celestial masters from the mountain sects, should have some techniques and supernatural powers to specifically overcome emotional entanglements, but I think we should also consider Sui Jingcheng’s state of mind…”

Gu Mo started to get a headache. “Can you speak more directly? What should be done? Does it have to be so roundabout?!”

Chen Pingan looked at her and asked, “For you, it’s just a matter of taking action once or twice, but for Sui Jingcheng, it concerns the direction of her entire life’s path. What’s wrong with us discussing it a bit more? Isn’t it worth taking some time to talk over a few days? Cultivating on the mountain, unaware of worldly hardships, is this time so long?! If the ones sitting here today were not Mr. Liu and me, but two others with similar cultivation levels, you might have already suffered serious injuries and retreated.”

Qi Jinglong replied calmly, “Or even died.”

Chen Pingan sighed. “Can’t you communicate?”

Qi Jinglong acknowledged, “Continue.”

Chen Pingan retrieved two flasks of wine, tossing one to Qi Jinglong while he opened the other, taking a sip. Qi Jinglong merely held the wine without drinking it; he truly didn’t like alcohol.

Rong Chang chuckled at the situation.

The words were indeed harsh. 

But the reasoning was valid. 

He found it somewhat acceptable. 

However, Gu Mo appeared quite displeased.

As expected, Gu Mo stood up, coldly laughing, “Afraid of death yet hoping to enter the Taixia lineage?! How about slaying demons and eliminating monsters?! Hiding on the mountain and climbing step by step, how convenient! You wouldn’t even need to encounter someone like you! If I, Gu Mo, die, it’s just one Dragon Gate Realm cultivator, but two higher-ranked bastards would die in North Junlu. Who loses and who gains in this deal?!”

Chen Pingan hesitated, “Are you not at a loss yourself?”

Gu Mo cursed, “Curse your grandpa!”

Chen Pingan wasn’t angry at all; he turned and smiled, “You have a higher cultivation level, so you can reason with me.”

Qi Jinglong smiled and said, “You have a better temper, so you should talk.”

Gu Mo, wearing the “Taixia” robe with sleeves billowing, had a face as pale as iron from rage. “You two, stop dawdling! Just let someone come out and spar with me!”

Chen Pingan replied, “Your sect is too formidable; I wouldn’t dare fight you.”

Gu Mo laughed in anger, “I’m not mad! It’s just a friendly match, no life or death involved!”

Qi Jinglong smiled, “Picking soft persimmons is not a wise move.”

Gu Mo felt no shame at all, stating confidently, “It’s not about slaying demons and eliminating monsters; dying is just dying. If I were to spar with you, wouldn’t that be a disgrace?”

Gu Mo turned to the lower fifth realm cultivator. “Since you’ve been pretending to be a Golden Dan sword cultivator all this time, even defeating some tough opponents, including that Golden Body Realm warrior from the Daguang Dynasty and that knife-wielding Xiao Shuye, I don’t see you as a soft persimmon either. Why not have a match between us, no sect involved?”

Then, Gu Mo asked suspiciously, “Are you two whispering about something?”

Chen Pingan nodded. “I was asking Mr. Liu if your robe can withstand the full strike of an earth immortal sword cultivator, which is why you seem so confident. Mr. Liu said it must.”

Gu Mo exploded in anger. “Shameless!”

Rong Chang rubbed his temples. 

What was all this?

Had he known it would become such a hassle, he should have let someone else take charge before leaving the Floating Poppy Sword Lake. 

Chen Pingan stood up. 

Gu Mo laughed, “Oh, before we fight, do you want to chat some more?”

Chen Pingan shook his head. “During a fight, I don’t say much. It depends on whether you have the skill to make me speak, while I quietly catch my breath.”

With a stomp of his foot, a partially visible snow-white dragon appeared on the wall of the courtyard. The light exploded, dazzling and brilliant, like a common person suddenly looking up at the sun, causing one to squint.

Rong Chang merely narrowed his eyes slightly.

Gu Mo instinctively shut his eyes, then realized something was off and opened them wide.

It all happened in an instant.

A flash of snow-white sword light and a streak of ghostly green sword light shot out.

The figure in the blue robe vanished suddenly, appearing next to Gu Mo before swiftly returning to his original spot, sitting down gently.

Gu Mo stood still for a moment, then sat cross-legged on the small boat, “Alright, I admit defeat. You can continue with your reasoning; I’ll endure it no matter how annoying you are.”

This was also the reason why Rong Chang was willing to accompany Gu Mo and maintain a good relationship.

Gu Mo seemed to have a delayed reaction, angrily exclaiming, “Wait! Was it Liu Jinglong who helped you draw the talisman that gave you the upper hand?!”

Qi Jinglong waved his hand dismissively, “That has nothing to do with me.”

Rong Chang added, “It indeed has nothing to do with Mr. Liu.”

Gu Mo scrutinized the young man in the blue robe, curiously asking, “Why do you have two flying swords that are not your innate flying sword?”

Chen Pingan responded, “Aren’t you being a bit hypocritical?”

Gu Mo grinned, “Unfortunately, they’re not as fast as your sword. Furthermore, this is not a life-or-death battle; I have no issues with a mere spar.”

Chen Pingan sighed internally. 

Aside from that robe, Gu Mo actually had at least two more flying swords hidden away. Like himself, they weren’t her innate objects. One was likely from the Taixia lineage’s resources, while the second was probably a gift from the Floating Poppy Sword Lake. Therefore, as Gu Mo’s cultivation level increased, especially after reaching the earth immortal stage, her opponents would find themselves increasingly troubled. 

As for reaching the upper fifth realm, it represented a different level of endeavor. All external objects needed to be pursued to perfection, maximizing killing power, strengthening defenses, and mastering the most peculiar techniques. The more terrifying the ultimate abilities, the greater the odds of winning. Otherwise, everything would merely add decorative flair. For instance, Jiang Shangzhen had many magical treasures, which were undoubtedly useful, yet in a life-and-death battle, after determining the victor, they still needed to see the refinement level of that willow leaf to make a final judgment on both parties’ fates.

Gu Mo could see through the fact that the initial and final flying swords were not innate flying swords, which likely indicated the vision expected of a disciple from a large sect.

Rong Chang spoke, “Currently, a relatively safe method would be to wait for my master to arrive here and let her meet Sui Jingcheng before discussing further. I wonder if Mr. Chen and Mr. Liu would be willing to wait a bit longer?”

This was actually quite a demanding proposition.

Relatively safe only meant so for Rong Chang and Gu Mo.

For the young outsider, one misstep could lead to life-threatening calamities with endless repercussions. If he were to leave today, leaving Sui Jingcheng behind would actually save him worry and effort. Achieving this step, even if Master Li Cai arrived in the Green Oriole Kingdom, she still wouldn’t find fault with it. Would it be necessary for her “secluded disciple” to have a few slaps to wake up the junior sister? Would it work? Ordinary women might, but looking at Sui Jingcheng’s every word and action, it was evident she was perceptive and thoughtful, unlike the straightforwardness of his junior sister back in her cultivation days.

Thus, the more esteemed Sui Jingcheng was in the Floating Poppy Sword Lake, the higher his master’s cultivation would be, making this young outsider increasingly dangerous, as the unexpected would only increase.

The reason Rong Chang hadn’t suggested this earlier was that such a statement easily turned what could have been a good opportunity for an in-depth conversation into a matter of life and death. 

At that point, both would retreat to the Taihui Sword Sect. 

Even Master Li Cai wouldn’t go to the Taihui Sword Sect to find them.

It made no sense and was also meaningless.

Cultivators from North Junlu were not entirely unreasonable, but everyone had their own reasoning that conformed to the customs of their continent. However, the reasoning here was quite different from that of others.

That was why so many foreign cultivators with impressive backgrounds met their demise here, often without any trace of how they died. Besides the younger brother of the God of Wealth from the Aiai Continent, who was a direct descendant of the Dragon Tiger Mountain Tianshi Mansion, there were actually several others of similarly terrifying identities. Yet, due to information suppression, apart from the sect heads, no one else knew of them, including a favored disciple of the deputy headmaster of the Confucian Temple.

These deceased individuals had numerous living people, old immortals, backing them up; who among them lacked depth in their background or strength in their fists?

But could you come to North Junlu and roll up your sleeves to test your strength?

North Junlu might lack in other areas, but it had plenty of sword cultivators and sword immortals!

Chen Pingan had reached a decision internally but said nothing, merely turning to Qi Jinglong.

Qi Jinglong smiled, “I remain unoccupied.”

Chen Pingan hesitated. 

Qi Jinglong continued, “Even if I finish speaking, the Taihui Sword Sect still has its own principles to uphold.”

Chen Pingan chose not to say anything further.

Then, he stood and knocked on the door.

Qi Jinglong had already casually removed the talisman.

Chen Pingan took Sui Jingcheng to the lotus pond, sharing everything that could be said with her.

In the end, Chen Pingan smiled, “Now, you don’t need to overthink anything. Under this premise, what are your plans?”

Sui Jingcheng quietly asked, “Will this cause trouble for the senior and Mr. Liu?”

Chen Pingan shook his head. “On the path of cultivation, as long as you don’t seek out trouble, you needn’t fear trouble coming your way.”

Gu Mo sat in the small boat, even more idle than Qi Jinglong. While appearing to gaze at the lotus leaves outside, she had been listening intently, unable to suppress a roll of her eyes.

It wasn’t that she disagreed with what was being said; on the contrary, she found it quite reasonable. Yet, she couldn’t deny her preconceived notions about the Chen fellow.

Sui Jingcheng nodded and smiled, “Then I’ll wait until I meet that high person before deciding.”

Chen Pingan replied, “Sounds good.”

Sui Jingcheng’s expression dimmed slightly, her eyes filled with guilt as she hesitated to speak.

Chen Pingan furrowed his brows. “If you overthink everything, it will only drag you down. What’s the point of that? Do you resent your rapid progress in cultivation? Or do you think the matter of cultivating one’s heart is too easy?”

Sui Jingcheng replied with an “oh.” 

She neither refuted nor reflected.

If it were his top disciple, Chen Pingan would have delivered a swift reprimand by now. 

Qi Jinglong continued to sit in place, avoiding all sights and sounds. 

However, due to his high cultivation and clear speech, it was hard to ignore.

Rong Chang might have been the most troubled person in this situation. 

With the big picture already established, the initially urgent Gu Mo had transformed into the most relaxed person, watching the pair with their strange relationship, feeling a bit intrigued. 

Afterward, Gu Mo and Rong Chang settled into two large residences at the Dragon Head Inn for celestial guests.

The two houses were not small. 

Separated from the lotus pond residence by a considerable distance, it was a small gesture of sincerity to avoid being misinterpreted as not trusting the two young men in blue robes. 

Gu Mo and Rong Chang sat across from each other in the small courtyard. 

Gu Mo asked, “Rong Chang, I’m just casually asking, can you really not defeat Liu Jinglong? Was it a single move that led to your defeat?”

Rong Chang smiled. “If we were to fight for real, I certainly wouldn’t lose that badly, although the odds would be extremely slim. Qi Jinglong and that outsider female daoist faced off at Chisel Mountain, either they held back or found a way to breakthrough.”

Gu Mo sighed, “This Liu Jinglong is truly a peculiar person! Who can advance so effortlessly through realms? It’s like a hot knife through butter; he makes people envious.”

Rong Chang laughed, “If we were to compare him with the two before him, wouldn’t we just be crashing against a wall?”

Gu Mo shook her head. “Those two? I wouldn’t even consider competing with them, nor would I have the thought. Liu Jinglong holds tremendous potential to become one of the top people in North Junlu, but those two? It’s already set in stone. Even one of my distant sect’s masters predicted that one of them would have the opportunity to rank among the top ten in the Central Divine Continent.”

Suddenly, Gu Mo asked, “The treasure bottle continent where Sword Immortal Li went, I’ve heard that the Sword Immortal Wei Jin from the Wind and Snow Temple and the Prince of Dali, Song Changjing, are also strong figures?”

Rong Chang nodded. “Both are quite strong, with great potential.”

Gu Mo asked curiously, “I won’t discuss Wei Jin, but Song Changjing is purely a martial artist; his path seems more challenging for him. Does the concept of great potential apply to him?”

Rong Chang recalled a certain fellow who once stood beside his master, seemingly careless, and paraphrased, “Beyond the great path of longevity, there are also other great paths.”

Gu Mo smiled, “Such words sound somewhat similar to those of the masters on our mountain, atop the Padi Peak.”

Rong Chang chose not to elaborate further. 

After all, Padi Peak belonged to the Fire Dragon Real Person, who rarely interfered in sect matters, leaving them to his disciples and grandchildren to manage. The old immortal only cared about sleeping. 

Gu Mo’s master, Taixia Yuanjun, had attained a high level of cultivation, having opened up his peak and left Padi Peak to take on disciples and expand.

Besides the Taixia lineage, there were three other lineages on North Junlu that were quite renowned. The Peach Mountain lineage was particularly adept in the Five Thunder Techniques, the White Cloud lineage excelled in talismans, and the Zhi Xuan lineage specialized in sword techniques.

However, without exception, all the prominent disciples from these four lineages in North Junlu, when discussing their master’s teachings, would always say they had merely learned a bit on the surface.

Would listeners believe such polite words?

In North Junlu, they truly would.

And this wasn’t even the most exaggerated claim; the most exasperating rumor that circulated years ago quickly spread across most of North Junlu, claiming that one of the Fire Dragon Real Person’s direct disciples, during his travels down the mountain, casually chatted with an outsider who visited Padi Peak. Somehow, he “leaked a heavenly secret,” stating that his master once told him that his greatest regret in life was his somewhat inadequate ability to slay demons and eliminate evil.

Apparently, that disciple seemed to deeply agree with this sentiment, yet when discussing the matter, the young daoist didn’t seem to harbor any grievances against his master.

Many sword immortals from elsewhere wanted to grab that direct disciple’s head and loudly ask, “Are you serious? You’re not joking, are you?!”

Of course, after questioning, the sword immortals would still smile and send him off.

Sword immortals in North Junlu feared nothing in heaven or earth, but they did fear that old Fire Dragon Real Person.

Fortunately, this old immortal had a penchant for sleeping and didn’t like to descend the mountain.

However, much like that missing young daoist, many of these Fire Dragon Real Person’s direct disciples, who had poor aptitude, remained at Padi Peak, supposedly cultivating, but in the eyes of other sect disciples, they were just… waiting to die. Besides them, there were many young daoist children. After all, even if their cultivation was lacking, they would still have their own disciples. 

They often heard the Fire Dragon Real Person personally imparting his teachings, yet it seemed they still couldn’t grasp it. 

It had been a long time since any disciple from Padi Peak had impressed someone in matters of cultivation, to the point where others could ask, “Can we discuss some principles?” In short, they wasted the great opportunity of being associated with an immortal family.

Many earth immortal cultivators from North Junlu believed that if they were given the chance to be any of those foolish daoists from Padi Peak, they would have long ascended to the heavens and reached the upper fifth realm.

Thus, Padi Peak was a place of bewildering cultivation, with spiritual energy not being the best. The direct disciples remaining there were often seen as having little hope for great paths. Hence, even though these daoists had high ranks, they had ultimately become just high-ranking individuals. Moreover, Padi Peak rarely interacted with other mountain peaks, and with the Fire Dragon Real Person often in seclusion… essentially sleeping, neither the Taixia nor the White Cloud lineages had any reason to get close to them. 

As for the origin of the name Padi Peak, various explanations abound. 

The most mystical explanation suggests that Padi Peak was home to several fierce and high-level dragons that were hidden away. One day, the Fire Dragon Real Person passed through and, finding them displeasing, stomped them all into submission. After that, the fierce dragons, once flattened, dared not move again. The old immortal decided to settle there and had his disciples use their supernatural powers to relocate mountains and soil from remote areas. Those fierce dragons thus became immobile mountain ranges, and it’s said that at least Zizhao Peak, Nanhua Peak, and Fuyou Peak originated from “dragon veins.”

As for how many fierce dragons the old immortal flattened back then, who knows?

Rong Chang smiled and asked, “Has the old immortal not returned yet?”

Gu Mo felt somewhat melancholic. “Not yet. If my ancestor were on the mountain, my master surely wouldn’t have passed away.”

Rong Chang sighed. 

There were some words he couldn’t say much about.

Such as that life and death are determined by fate.

Once one reaches the height of an old immortal like the Fire Dragon Real Person, his compassion may not be understood by practitioners like us.

However, Rong Chang truly respected the Fire Dragon Real Person, and it came from the heart.

As did his master, Li Cai.

It was simple; it was based on the Fire Dragon Real Person’s three sentences.

“We come from the world below and will eventually return to the world below. Climbing the mountain relies on walking, descending the mountain relies on riding the wind. Great feats on the path of cultivation are hard to achieve; once one becomes an immortal, even small matters are easy to accomplish.”

“However, if someone can break free from the restraints of heaven and earth and see the highest peaks, that is of course a good thing. There could be more such cultivators in North Junlu.”

“Don’t let the name of the first continent beyond the Central Plains be solely tied to swordsmanship; killing and fighting are not true skills; with a few slaps, I could easily put an end to you.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 620: A Clap of Hands

At the renowned "Sky" courtyard of the Kingfisher Inn.

After the storm passed, the rain cleared, and the sky turned blue.

Fragrant lotus wafted through the air as the lotus leaves swayed gently.

Chen Ping'an and Qi Jinglong sat side by side on a long bench, while Sui Jingcheng sat alone on a nearby bench.

Qi Jinglong remarked, “Congratulations on entering the third realm.”

Chen Ping'an nodded in acknowledgment.

Sui Jingcheng’s eyes lit up with surprise. Was it only the third realm?

She stood up, squatted by the lotus pond, and picked a lotus leaf before returning to her spot on the bench.

Chen Ping'an and Qi Jinglong fell silent, gazing quietly at the pond.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an asked, “Those embroidered mandarin ducks, were they produced by the Spring Dew Garden?”

Qi Jinglong didn’t rush to answer; instead, he leaned forward and glanced at Sui Jingcheng. 

The girl wore a look of admiration, likely impressed by her senior’s extensive knowledge.

Qi Jinglong promptly straightened up and spoke to Chen Ping'an with a ripple of thoughts, “I didn’t realize it before, but I’m starting to understand why Rong Chang is worried. There’s indeed reason for concern.”

Having stepped into the third realm of Qi practitioners, Chen Ping'an found he could barely converse with the ripple of his mind. He smiled and said, “Let’s not dwell on that. We’ll wait for the Grandmaster of Floating Duck Sword Lake to arrive before discussing further.”

Qi Jinglong continued, “That female sword immortal, named Li Cai, isn’t a bad person, though her temperament…”

Chen Ping'an sighed. “Being close friends with the Grandmaster of Taixia, who also taught a disciple like Gu Mo, speaks volumes.”

Qi Jinglong fell silent.

Unwilling to be left out, Sui Jingcheng tried to interject. “Mr. Liu, earlier you said that reason doesn’t reside in fists, yet you still convinced Rong Chang through your cultivation, and even brought up your sect, the Taihui Sword Sect?”

Chen Ping'an and Qi Jinglong exchanged amused glances but remained quiet.

Sui Jingcheng felt a bit embarrassed, wondering if she was the only one who didn’t understand anything.

Feeling a little aggrieved, she lowered her head and gently twisted the lotus leaf in her hands.

In the past, whenever she was confused, her seniors would explain things to her. Now, facing Qi Jinglong, it seemed he was unwilling to do the same.

Fortunately, Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “Mr. Liu’s insights were meant for the entire Taixia lineage, even for that old immortal, Huo Long.”

Sui Jingcheng raised her head, understanding his explanation. “So when Rong Chang mentioned his master would come, Mr. Liu was also speaking for that sword immortal from Floating Duck Sword Lake? Rong Chang would help pass the message along to make that sword immortal cautious?”

After a moment, Sui Jingcheng tentatively asked, “Can we say that Mr. Liu’s so-called greatest rule is to make those with strong fists hesitate when they could easily kill? This allows those with weaker fists to speak a bit more? Even if they don’t say anything, that itself is reason? But if there’s a huge disparity in strength, whether to strike still lies with the stronger party?”

Her eyes sparkled as she continued, “Could it also mean that this validates what the senior said about ‘at the very least, it creates one more possibility’?”

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Qi Jinglong smiled and said, “Let’s not discuss examples, just the majority of situations. In bustling streets, why do strong and robust people not dare to break into houses and rob? In worldly dynasties, why do rich and spoiled youngsters still need to hide their misdeeds? When cultivators descend from the mountain, why don’t they recklessly plunder a wealthy city’s treasures, leaving no survivors? Why do I, with my Nascent Soul cultivation, dare to wait here with you, Mr. Chen, for the grand arrival of a Jade Purity realm sword cultivator? So, having strong fists is indeed impressive; this isn’t a pejorative statement. However, those who can bind those fists are naturally even more remarkable.”

Chen Ping'an reminded him, “Watch your wording.”

Sui Jingcheng smiled slightly.

Qi Jinglong hesitated, gazing at the lotus pond. “However, this is the rule in ordered realms; it doesn’t apply in chaotic places. Still, as long as society moves forward, looking at history and the current situation, we still need to transition from disorder to order, unite as one, and turn the often imperfect surface order into a harmonious order in the mountains and sound laws below. Gradually, the world should move from reasoning to a larger, more inclusive realm of reason, ensuring more people can benefit, perhaps finding a balanced state without being confined to the teachings of the Three Religions or the Hundred Schools of Thought.”

Chen Ping'an softly interjected, “Let’s not discuss these matters for now.”

And Qi Jinglong ceased his discourse.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an remarked, “That Gu Mo’s mindset is commendable.”

Qi Jinglong acknowledged, “The world needs many such mountain cultivators, but we can’t have only such cultivators. Thus, there’s no need to rush when we encounter Gu Mo, nor should we demand too much from her.”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “Exactly.”

Sui Jingcheng watched the two men, snorted softly, took hold of a lotus leaf, and got up to retreat into the house for practice.

Am I a nuisance to your eyes? Fine, I’ll leave.

Chen Ping'an asked, “What’s that about?”

Qi Jinglong helplessly replied, “You’re the expert; don’t ask me.”

Chen Ping'an was puzzled. “Expert at what?”

Qi Jinglong quickly changed the topic. “Shall we discuss some considerations for practicing in the third realm?”

Chen Ping'an glanced at the wine jar in his hand. “If it’s not for drinking, then just give it back. That’s several pieces of fairy wine.”

Qi Jinglong chuckled, “Do you think I don’t know about glutinous rice wine? Did you forget I came from the streets? Haven’t I drunk or seen it before?”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment. “I must have gotten it wrong.”

Meanwhile, Sui Jingcheng, deliberately slowing her pace, finally stepped over the threshold and slammed the door shut with a loud bang.

Qi Jinglong looked puzzled.

Chen Ping'an said, “You can’t guess a woman’s thoughts.”

Qi Jinglong nodded. “Wise words, indeed.”

After some casual chatting, Chen Ping'an no longer referred to Qi Jinglong as Mr. Liu but addressed him by name.

“Qi Jinglong, do you have a girl you like?”

“Nope.”

“How pitiful.”

“…”

“You’re not drinking yet? You’re almost a hundred, and you still don’t have a girl you like?”

“Shut up.”

“Should I get you a jar of real fairy wine?”

“Chen Ping'an, if I drink, can we change the subject?”

“…”

Qi Jinglong began drinking heartily, not needing Chen Ping'an to persuade him.

“Qi Jinglong, shall we drink and chat? You’re not bad looking, and your cultivation is high; there must be no shortage of girls who like you.”

“Get lost!”

These days, the Dragon Head Ferry Inn was quite peaceful.

However, the number of guests was steadily increasing, with some even crowding the place.

Rumors spread about a female disciple from Huo Long’s side appearing, accompanied by an unknown sword immortal.

Tensions flared as they confronted another group.

Fortunately, no fights broke out, and peace was maintained.

This was also why various cultivators dared to gather at the inn to enjoy the spectacle; otherwise, they’d be inviting trouble upon themselves.

Chen Ping'an and Qi Jinglong discussed many key aspects of cultivating in the lower five realms.

Qi Jinglong naturally shared everything he knew.

As for talismans, both had plenty to share.

However, neither casually divulged their respective secret talisman techniques.

It was not that they were unwilling; it was that they couldn’t.

For example, the ghostly axe palace snow mud talisman drawn on the wall by Chen Ping'an and the restrictive talisman array casually crafted by Qi Jinglong.

Nevertheless, the principles of the Great Dao were interconnected, and exchanging insights on talismans was more beneficial for cultivation than simply learning specific talismans.

Of course, Qi Jinglong was already an expert in this field, primarily helping Chen Ping'an resolve his queries.

When Qi Jinglong learned that Chen Ping'an had over three hundred yellow paper talismans hidden in his sleeves, he couldn’t help but break into a sweat, speechless.

Did you take me for a talisman vendor?

Regarding the incident with the assassins from the Deer-Cutting Mountain, Qi Jinglong only commented, “Extremely dangerous.”

However, when Chen Ping'an presented the spoils collected by Sui Jingcheng, Qi Jinglong merely gave rough estimates for items like the sweet dew armor and giant bow, but he couldn’t help but exclaim over the two short blades engraved with “Morning Dew” and “Evening Glow,” saying, “What incredible luck!”

The reason was simple.

Qi Jinglong had not learned the inside story of the Deer-Cutting Mountain nor did he know the female cultivator.

However, he had come across this pair of short blades in an ancient tome of immortals; they were of significant historical value. The female assassin from Deer-Cutting Mountain had merely been lucky to acquire these long-lost immortal weapons, yet unfortunate in that she had not mastered the essence of their crafting and use. Thus, Qi Jinglong detailed what he had read in the book to Chen Ping'an.

Sui Jingcheng beamed with joy.

Later, Gu Mo and Rong Chang each visited the lotus pond courtyard. Rong Chang discussed swordsmanship with Qi Jinglong, while Gu Mo inquired about the veracity of certain stories and rumors. For instance, did Qi Jinglong really kill that Nascent Soul demon at the Golden Core stage? Did he genuinely have a romantic connection with the Lu Fairy of Shui Jing Mountain? Qi Jinglong answered each question honestly without evasion. After hearing all the answers, Gu Mo felt both satisfied and somewhat disappointed. She couldn’t shake the feeling that her senior sisters had poor taste in admiring such a dreadfully dull disciple from the Taihui Sword Sect.

Chen Ping'an and Sui Jingcheng sat on the long bench, munching on sunflower seeds and watching the commotion.

When Gu Mo asked about the Lu Fairy, Chen Ping'an and Sui Jingcheng exchanged glances.

After Gu Mo left, Sui Jingcheng noticed her senior casting her a knowing glance. She quickly stopped eating the seeds, clapped her hands, and resolved to ask Qi Jinglong about the Shui Jing Mountain female cultivator. After all, she was curious about what the female disciple looked like. Along the journey, neither Gu Mo nor the two female cultivators on the boat could compare to her.

As it turned out, Qi Jinglong simply sat there with his eyes closed and said, “I’m going to meditate now.”

About ten days later, under the cover of night, Chen Ping'an had nearly solidified his aura in the third realm.

There was no astounding commotion, no soaring sword or thunderous roars.

On the opposite bank of the lotus pond, a female cultivator appeared quietly, a sword at her waist.

Qi Jinglong, who had been sitting on the long bench, opened his eyes, and Chen Ping'an, who had been transcribing scriptures inside the house, put down his brush and stepped outside.

Qi Jinglong stood up and smiled. “Greetings, Sword Immortal Li.”

Li Cai waved her hand. “Rong Chang has already sent me a message via flying sword. I know the general situation. Where is that girl named Sui Jingcheng? I’ll talk to her first to see if she wants to thank you or reprimand you.”

Li Cai took a step forward and passed by Qi Jinglong and the bench. “You dared to use the Taihui Sword Sect to frighten me, huh? Well done, Liu Jinglong.”

Qi Jinglong laughed. “I’m not at the Jade Purity realm yet, but Sword Immortal Li can formally challenge me according to the rules.”

Li Cai chuckled. “Just wait. But you better hurry, as I’ll be leaving North Ju Lu Prefecture soon. I need to help Li Yu with the demon-slaying matter.”

Qi Jinglong pondered for a moment. “If the opportunity arises.”

Li Cai turned back, clicking her tongue. “They say you speak like a woman wrapping her feet. Is that gossip from the mountains really so unreliable? With your cultivation and temperament, you could definitely compete for the next sect leader at Floating Duck Sword Lake.”

Qi Jinglong turned to look at Chen Ping'an, who stood nearby.

Chen Ping'an lightly nodded.

Li Cai halted, noticing the young man in the green robe standing not far away. “You must be Chen Ping'an?”

Chen Ping'an asked in confusion, “How does the Sword Immortal know my name?”

Li Cai pondered for a moment before giving a dubious answer. “I guessed.”

Chen Ping'an didn’t press further and stepped aside to let her pass.

Li Cai entered the house with a single stride.

With a wave of her sleeve, she created a small world.

Sui Jingcheng was fast asleep.

She gently sat at the head of the bed, gazing at the somewhat unfamiliar face.

Li Cai smiled and sighed, “You’re looking quite handsome.”

Then she sighed again. “But you’ll have to endure some hardships, girl. You really are your master’s favorite disciple. It’s true that kindred spirits often find each other.”

She then seemed somewhat annoyed and cursed, “Jiang Shangzhen and his big mouth!”

Bending her fingers, she lightly tapped Sui Jingcheng’s forehead. “You enter seclusion and still bring shame to your master!”

Sui Jingcheng woke up, startled to find a sword-wielding woman lighting a lamp and sitting in a chair facing her.

Sui Jingcheng sat at the edge of the bed, speechless.

Li Cai said, “No need to be afraid. Just chat about your experiences in the Sui family of the Wuling Kingdom over the years.”

About the time it would take to burn a stick of incense later, Li Cai led the dazed Sui Jingcheng out of the house.

Li Cai turned to Chen Ping'an and said, “Chen Ping'an, from now on, Sui Jingcheng can continue her travels in the Treasure Bottle Continent, but there’s one bottom line: no matter whom she recognizes as a master, including you or anyone else, they can only be recorded as a nominal disciple and cannot be entered into the ancestral hall’s genealogy. She can only decide whether to write her name in the Floating Duck Sword Lake’s ancestral hall or any other ancestral hall once she has enlightened herself. Until that day, I won’t restrain her, and you also can’t influence her mindset any further. Aside from you, anyone else can. As for Rong Chang, he will serve as her protector, accompanying her to the Treasure Bottle Continent.”

As Chen Ping'an was about to confirm how to influence her mindset and how to “record” it, Li Cai grew somewhat irked and waved her sleeve. “Forget it, as long as you don’t roll in the sheets, the rest is up to you.”

After finishing, Li Cai soared away on her sword with a significant flourish, apparently in a bad mood.

Sui Jingcheng felt her cheeks burning, lowered her head, and dashed back into the house.

Qi Jinglong stifled a laugh.

Chen Ping'an sighed.

On the wall, due to the master's arrival, Rong Chang didn’t dare to stand; he crouched down instead.

Gu Mo did the same, fueling the fire with, “Rong Sword Immortal, what does rolling in the sheets mean?”

Rong Chang, in a good mood, pretended to be serious and said, “I’m not too sure.”

Gu Mo and Rong Chang left together.

Liu Jinglong was the first to leave the lotus pond and went to a different room to begin his practice.

Chen Ping'an knocked on the door, and after Sui Jingcheng opened it, the two sat on separate long benches.

Sui Jingcheng softly asked, “In the end, I still caused trouble for my senior, didn’t I?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head. “Shall I share some heartfelt words with you?”

Sui Jingcheng nodded.

Turning to look at him, Chen Ping'an spoke slowly. “If you like someone, it doesn’t matter how high their realm is or if they’re just an ordinary teacher; it really isn’t a problem. But if the person you like already likes someone else, wouldn’t that be very painful? You could say it doesn’t matter; liking someone is my own affair. If the other person doesn’t like me, I can just watch from afar. In fact, I thought the same back then, so I don’t misunderstand; this isn’t about right or wrong, so it’s hard to reason out. After walking quite a distance, I, Chen Ping'an, am not blind and won’t miss the signs regarding love interests that concern me.”

“For me to say I won’t like you isn’t out of fear that I might lose control of my feelings if I don’t tell myself that. It’s not to make you think I’m a lovesick person. In reality, I feel the most at peace regarding romantic feelings because I’ve learned this long before my training; to me, it’s a natural thing. You should know that many things I once thought were natural have changed gradually, except for this: when I like someone, I simply like her, and that’s enough.”

Sui Jingcheng remained silent, simply gazing at him.

The young man in the green robe said softly, “I’m sorry.”

Sui Jingcheng wiped her tears and smiled. “It’s fine. Being able to like a senior who doesn’t like me seems to be better than liking someone who also doesn’t like me.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head and fell silent.

Sui Jingcheng smiled and asked, “Is the senior also only a third realm Qi practitioner?”

Chen Ping'an turned and replied, “But I’m younger than you.”

Sui Jingcheng placed her hands on the long bench, stretched out her legs, swayed her head, and grinned, “I won’t get upset.”

Qi Jinglong, indeed practicing, was also listening to the conversations from across the lotus pond without missing a word.

Higher realms do come with some troubles.

After some thought, Qi Jinglong decided he should consult Chen Ping'an properly, even if he had to endure some drinking.

Sui Jingcheng sat for a while before returning to her room to rest.

Chen Ping'an began breathing exercises by the lotus pond, and at dawn, left the courtyard to find Gu Mo. After things settled, he had something to say.

After Gu Mo opened the door, the two sat on stone stools in the courtyard.

Chen Ping'an got straight to the point. “Zhang Shanfeng is my friend. Do you know him, Gu Xianzi?”

Gu Mo nodded. “I know him, but not well—just seen him a few times. By seniority, he’s my master’s uncle.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, noting that the old Taoist who had appeared in the alleys around Qingluan Kingdom must be Zhang Shanfeng’s master, undoubtedly Huo Long.

As the three had different seniorities, their robes were generally similar.

However, Chen Ping'an didn’t elaborate much. After learning that both Zhang Shanfeng and Huo Long were no longer at Pa Di Peak, he merely inquired if he could visit them if he passed by in the future.

Gu Mo smiled. “Since you know that little master uncle, why not?”

Then Gu Mo added, “But when you reach the peak, don’t greet me; I’m not very familiar with you.”

Chen Ping'an laughed. “We’ll talk about it later.”

Gu Mo narrowed her eyes. “The senior sisters have a lot to say. If you do that, they can gossip for years, so don’t cause me trouble!”

Chen Ping'an laughed and nodded, then took his leave.

Suddenly, Gu Mo remarked, “Why didn’t you say you knew my little master uncle at the start? It might have avoided all those misunderstandings.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, offering no explanation.

Gu Mo’s mindset issues were apparent to Qi Jinglong, and Chen Ping'an could also vaguely sense some clues.

Better to ease the blockage than to block the flow.

Chen Ping'an felt this deeply.

Back then, Zhu Quan of the Pima Sect had done well above the clouds.

After Chen Ping'an departed, Gu Mo confirmed he had left. 

Only then did she raise her hand to wipe her face.

That little master uncle named Zhang Shanfeng.

Her master had only privately told her a little about him, mentioning that the founder had also shared a bit of heavenly secrets with her master.

The founder had told the Grandmaster of Taixia, “If one day your master is no longer in this world, as long as your little junior brother is still around, with just a stomp, Pa Di Peak will continue to be Pa Di Peak. You need not worry about anything.”

In the world, gatherings and partings are inevitable.

Chen Ping'an would continue his journey northward, then follow that great river upstream, crossing North Ju Lu Prefecture.

Qi Jinglong mentioned wanting to take a look at the Great Seal Capital.

At the Dragon Head Ferry’s dock, Gu Mo teased Sui Jingcheng, encouraging the beauty of the Sui family to pick the lotus flowers freely, as she was well-protected by Rong Chang. With such good looks, why hide?

Sui Jingcheng naturally ignored her.

Rong Chang also used a concealment technique to hide his Nascent Soul sword cultivator’s aura, suppressing it to the level of an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.

As long as one wasn’t a sword immortal, descending the mountain to explore North Ju Lu Prefecture while slapping a realm label on oneself—just try it! Some scoundrels at the Jade Purity realm loved to roam about aimlessly, often chasing after Nascent Soul cultivators and eighth or ninth realm martial artists, sending them fleeing in panic, all the while claiming, “I’m helping you practice; no need to thank me. Just block my sword.”

Such shameless high-level cultivators were plentiful.

Moreover, even if one became a sword immortal, it wasn’t guaranteed safety.

Chen Ping'an and Qi Jinglong strolled leisurely away.

Sui Jingcheng hesitated for a moment before following from a distance.

Gu Mo tried to keep up with her but was dissuaded by Rong Chang through a ripple of thoughts.

The two walked side by side, and Chen Ping'an spoke quietly, “Even if you’ve made an appointment with Sword Immortal Li, waiting for you to reach the Jade Purity realm, she’ll be one of the three sword immortals questioning you?”

Qi Jinglong chuckled in response, “Don’t worry; it’s not out of impulse. The sword intent of Floating Duck Sword Lake is significantly different from my own sword intent, and it’s excellent for honing my sword edge. As for danger, which new sword immortal in North Ju Lu Prefecture would worry about that? Moreover, you may not know this, but historically, many so-called sword questioning encounters also carry a deeper meaning of imparting teachings.”

Chen Ping'an nodded and smiled. “I’ve always admired the style of you sword immortals.”

Qi Jinglong smiled back. “I hope one day you can catch up to me. We can travel together through Central Plains then.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “That would be ideal.”

Chen Ping'an stopped walking and said, “If—just if—one day you, Qi Jinglong, encounter someone unreasonable, someone high-level and strong who needs help…”

After a brief pause, Chen Ping'an’s eyes were resolute. “Then count me in!”

After another pause, his smile brightened. “I’ll make sure they know what the fastest sword in the world is.”

Qi Jinglong couldn’t help but click his tongue. “You’re saying that in front of someone about to reach the fifth realm of swordsmanship, claiming your sword is fast?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled. “How old are you now? Look at my age.”

Qi Jinglong felt somewhat helpless. “It sounds quite reasonable.”

Chen Ping'an patted him on the shoulder. “Don’t mind me. I’ve just successfully refined my second life-bound object, so I’m a bit carried away.”

Sui Jingcheng stopped in her tracks, standing not far away, feeling that her parting words, which she had wanted to express, seemed unnecessary now.

Moreover, she thought that while Mr. Liu’s cultivation was indeed higher, he couldn’t compare to her senior in looks.

She turned and left.

Upon reaching Gu Mo’s side, Gu Mo nudged Sui Jingcheng with her shoulder and whispered, “Why do you like that Chen fellow? He clearly pales in comparison to Liu Jinglong. Leaving aside everything else, isn’t he less attractive than Liu Jinglong?”

Sui Jingcheng shot her a glance but didn’t respond, silently scoffing.

What a perfectly good girl; how could she be so blind?

In the distance.

Qi Jinglong extended his hand.

Chen Ping'an took out two jars of wine, one for each, as they faced the river leading to the sea, sipping their drinks.

Chen Ping'an softly said, “What defines a strong person, to me, is the realization of every buried dream from childhood, every boastful word spoken in youth coming true, and increasingly resembling those people I admired most back then. Qi Jinglong, what do you think?”

Qi Jinglong nodded. “That’s about right.”

Chen Ping'an continued, “Then all you need now is a girl you like and a love for drinking.”

Qi Jinglong completely ignored this remark but finally addressed the earlier question from Chen Ping'an. “If I ever face an enemy I can’t handle, I will call for you, Chen Ping'an, but only if you’ve at least reached the Nascent Soul realm or become a ninth realm martial artist. Otherwise, don’t blame me for not treating you like a friend.”

Chen Ping'an raised his hand, opening his palm. “A promise?”

Qi Jinglong hesitated for a moment, having never experienced such a thing. In the mountains, cultivators often live in a detached and ascetic manner, though there are life-and-death friendships formed through shared battles, mostly understood without words.

This kind of action, full of the worldly vibe, had never occurred before.

Yet Qi Jinglong raised his hand, a broad smile on his face, and slapped Chen Ping'an’s palm heavily. “Then it’s a promise!”

By the dock, two people who loved to reason each raised a wine jar, one hand holding it and the other clasping together.

The ferry from Dragon Head to the southern Bone Dunes slowly ascended, the clouds and sunset glowing like red brocade.

Gu Mo leaned against the railing, silently shedding tears. Her master had once said that her greatest wish in this lifetime was to ascend with the sunset.

Back then, Gu Mo had been a naive girl, asking what was so good about ascending.

Her master had merely gazed at the evening glow in the sky, revealing nothing to the girl.

Gu Mo wasn’t sad about losing a support. The priests and female disciples of Taixia would descend the mountain to slay demons. As long as they survived, they wouldn’t return home to complain to their masters. But if they died, how could they complain? Gu Mo felt her master’s words made no sense, yet they were the most sensible.

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 621: The Rising Threat** 

Sui Jingcheng stood beside Gu Mo. 

Rong Chang had not shown up, but Qi Jinglong was nearby. He was heading south on the ferry, which conveniently passed through the territory of the Great Zhuang Dynasty. 

However, Qi Jinglong quickly returned to his quarters. 

On the ground, Chen Pingan, dressed in a blue robe, had already started walking north towards the estuary. 

Gu Mo and Sui Jingcheng were staying in adjacent cabins on the ferry. At this moment, Gu Mo had returned to her usual self, confidently following Sui Jingcheng into the cabin, pouring herself a cup of tea. She was quite at home, completely ignoring Sui Jingcheng’s expression that screamed, “I want to meditate alone.” With a smile, Gu Mo thought, with Sui Jingcheng’s current turbulent state of mind, could she really focus on her breathing? What a joke! 

Gu Mo asked, “Did that guy named Chen not give you a few tokens of affection?” 

Sui Jingcheng chose to ignore the brazen female cultivator. 

Gu Mo glanced at the small mountain-walking staff in Sui Jingcheng's hand. With her Dragon Gate realm cultivation at a bottleneck, she could easily see through the clumsy tricks, “Just this thing? The material is good, and it looks decent, but with how pretty Sui Jingcheng is, that guy clearly has no sincerity. Come on, Sui Jingcheng, I’m not saying this to be mean, but don’t let his sweet words deceive you.” 

Sui Jingcheng removed her veil and placed the staff on the table, sitting across from Gu Mo, leaning on the desk. 

Gu Mo sized up the beautiful woman from the Sui family, clicking her tongue in admiration. 

Any truly beautiful woman in the world is a sight to behold, whether she speaks or not. 

Once Sui Jingcheng reached the mid-fifth realm, her beauty would only shine brighter. At that time, wouldn’t it be something? Gu Mo couldn’t help but reach out to touch Sui Jingcheng’s delicate face. 

Sui Jingcheng swatted Gu Mo's hand away, sitting up straight and frowning, “Gu Xianzi, please be more respectful!” 

Gu Mo rolled her eyes, drank all her tea, and after setting down the cup, asked softly, “I heard you traveled to several countries with that Chen guy. If you were camping out, how did you manage to bathe? And you haven’t killed the Red Dragon yet, is it not a hassle?” 

Sui Jingcheng replied calmly, “Gu Xianzi, you’re a celestial cultivator. Isn’t it inappropriate to ask about these matters?” 

Gu Mo grinned, “Just because I’m a cultivator doesn’t mean I’m not human. Women cultivating are still women. Asking these things won’t cost you a cent, and it won’t make me lose a cent either, so just spill it.” 

Sui Jingcheng spoke sternly, “Senior is a righteous person. Gu Xianzi, I’ll only say this once: I don’t wish to hear such words again!” 

Gu Mo feigned horror, “Are you saying that when you get angry, you’ll have Rong Jianxian kill me?” 

Then Gu Mo dramatically let her head drop onto the table, leaning forward, waving her arms, “Noooo, I’m scared to death…” 

There was a soft knock at the door, and Rong Chang’s voice came from outside, “It’s me.” 

Sui Jingcheng sighed in relief and hurriedly said, “Come in.” 

Gu Mo had already straightened up, sipping tea slowly. 

Rong Chang seemed unfazed by the antics he had already witnessed. After sitting down, he said to Sui Jingcheng, “Next, we’ll be heading to the southernmost part of the North Julu Continent, the Bone Beach. After that, we’ll have to travel across the continent to the Treasure Bottle Continent. I’ll need to tell you about some taboos on the mountain. It might be a bit tedious, but there’s no other choice. Although the Treasure Bottle Continent is the smallest in the Haoran world, it’s not short of unusual people. We need to discuss the local customs.” 

Rong Chang was feeling a bit awkward. 

In Floating Duck Sword Lake, his temper was not the best, but compared to his master, Li Cai, he seemed quite amiable. 

Those who had either died or been injured under his sword would know how he truly was. 

As a prominent Nascent Soul sword cultivator in central North Julu, Rong Chang also had a few direct disciples in Floating Duck Sword Lake. In the marketplaces below, they believed in the saying that a stick would bring forth filial children, while for Rong Chang, it was to increase cultivation by taking a few sword strikes. 

However, with Sui Jingcheng, the younger sister of his master, Rong Chang naturally needed to be more patient. 

Sui Jingcheng listened attentively to Rong Chang’s lengthy explanations. 

Gu Mo wasn’t considered an outsider, so Rong Chang wouldn’t chase her away. She didn’t have enough sense to leave and simply sat there, pouring herself cup after cup of tea while yawning. She would rather endure the boring lecture than be alone in her room. 

Rong Chang felt relieved; it seemed Sui Jingcheng had learned many mountain rules from that Chen guy. 

Compared to that familiar little sister, she was indeed very different. 

The little sister was the best and worst at Floating Duck Sword Lake; when she was in a good mood, she could give pointers on swordsmanship for a long time, more dedicated than even a preacher. When she was in a bad mood, even Master Li Cai couldn’t do anything about her. After one trip, the little sister felt she was right, while the sword immortal master thought he was more correct, leading to an argument. The little sister, furious, was imprisoned until she was left with only her cave-dwelling realm cultivation and submerged in Floating Duck Sword Lake for six months. 

When she was pulled ashore, she was nearly on her last breath. When Master asked if she recognized her mistake, the little sister replied, “The scenery at the bottom of the lake is great; I just hadn’t seen enough.” 

In the end, Master looked around with a cold gaze, and Rong Chang, as the eldest disciple, had to step up, not forgetting to call a few fellow disciples with his mind, saying everyone was willing to take the punishment for the little sister. Only then did Master let it go, rewarding each of them with a sword strike to vent his frustration before leaving the shore. 

Afterward, Rong Chang was nearly hunted down by his fellow disciples, feeling utterly wronged. He couldn’t reveal the secret and had to escape the sect to avoid the storm. How could he help but act like an eldest brother when Master had quietly let him off, showing a bit of his senior demeanor? The methods Master used to make things difficult for others were no less than her swordsmanship, right? 

But Floating Duck Sword Lake was indeed a good place. 

For instance, there was an unwritten rule in the Patriarch Hall of Floating Duck Sword Lake: “All disciples must not use their Floating Duck Sword Lake identity when going down the mountain to practice swordsmanship. If they encounter something they cannot win against, they must take three steps: First, quickly escape. Second, if they cannot escape, report the name of Floating Duck Sword Lake's Li Cai. Third, if the name of Li Cai doesn’t work, don’t forget to pass on the name of the enemy before dying, so when the time comes for their soul to return to the sect, they will have a head to accompany them.” 

Rong Chang naturally hoped that the little sister could continue to improve and become the second sword immortal Li Cai from Floating Duck Sword Lake. 

As for himself, he had little hope. 

By the time one reached the Nascent Soul level, they already had a rough idea of how far they could go in the end. 

Becoming a Golden Core guest was what we humans aim for. 

But once the Golden Core was successfully formed, amidst the immense fortune, a more prominent watershed would appear. 

It was like those students who passed the imperial examination in secular dynasties; some would be ecstatic just to be a scholar and feel their ancestors were smiling down on them, immersed in that enormous sense of accomplishment for decades. These people were akin to wild cultivators in the mountains, or a small mountain dwelling of immortals, claiming to be the so-called genius of cultivation that only appeared once in hundreds of years. 

Some who received second-class scholar degrees might feel fortunate or still have some regrets. These were usually the lineage cultivators of large mountain sects. 

Others who ranked as the third place or the flower and willow, saw it as their due, but still felt it was slightly lacking. This small group were often the direct disciples of influential sects. 

And then there were those who achieved the top rank, the champion, simply because being the champion was the highest rank, nothing more. 

Liu Jinglong could count as one of those. 

As for the two “young cultivators” who ranked above Liu Jinglong, they were naturally even more so. 

Gu Mo, along with Liu Jinglong’s senior sister, and himself Rong Chang, all temporarily at different realms, but their ultimate achievements would likely be similar, hoping for the Yu Pu realm, if only possible. 

Sui Jingcheng suddenly said, “Rong Jianxian, will we be passing by Jinlin Palace?” 

Rong Chang smiled, “It’s not on the way, but we can go.” 

Sui Jingcheng looked puzzled. Was he planning to take her along to Jinlin Palace for a leisurely trip before hurrying back to the ferry? 

Rong Chang explained, “It’s just a matter of spending money. The ferry will agree to it and compensate the passengers; it just requires a few days of detour.” 

Sui Jingcheng asked, “What if the ferry passengers refuse to take the money?” 

Rong Chang laughed, “A Nascent Soul sword cultivator giving them money? They should be burning incense in gratitude.” 

Sui Jingcheng shook her head. 

Rong Chang said seriously, “What I previously mentioned was more about the taboos and customs of the Treasure Bottle Continent. The ferry is still within the territory of North Julu; these are our mountain rules.” 

Sui Jingcheng smiled, “Forget it. I’ll wait until I’ve made progress in my cultivation before heading to Jinlin Palace to seek justice.” 

This time, it was Rong Chang’s turn to shake his head. 

Gu Mo was grinning from ear to ear. 

It was said that there was an unknown Nascent Soul cultivator stationed at Jinlin Palace. While their actual combat ability was likely subpar among Nascent Souls, if Sui Jingcheng planned to resolve her grievances herself, it would mean she would at least have to become a Golden Core cultivator at the bottleneck. 

Seeking revenge or asking a sect for a sword, is always a matter of one person, one sword, against the entire mountain, first breaking through the mountain’s water array, then breaking through the combined attack array of the cultivators’ magical tools, and finally, clashing with the pillars of a sect. It’s like a lone warrior charging through a heavily armored infantry formation; it’s no laughing matter. How many reckless sword cultivators have died in North Julu’s history? 

Sui Jingcheng smiled, “I understand that it will take a long time, but that’s alright.” 

Rong Chang thought it might not be necessary. 

As long as you one day become that complete soul of the little sister from Floating Duck Sword Lake. 

Sui Jingcheng hesitated for a moment and said softly, “Rong Jianxian, I think it’s wiser to be cautious on long travels.” 

Rong Chang held back a laugh and nodded, “Alright.” 

Gu Mo echoed, “Rong Jianxian, be careful; there are many old sayings in the Jianghu that you should heed.” 

Sui Jingcheng ignored Gu Mo’s teasing, continuing, “Rong Jianxian, some of the looks you give the ferry passengers are too obvious. While your cultivation can be hidden, certain aspects of a sword cultivator are hard to conceal. In the eyes of those who are observant, it would inevitably raise their guard. If a group of desperate individuals were to attack, the combat power of the cave-dwelling realm could rally accomplices, turning a small matter into a big deal, and a big deal into a disaster.” 

Sui Jingcheng thought for a moment and blushed, “It’s probably because my cultivation is low. I’ve encountered a few dangerous situations while traveling the Jianghu, and I might be a bit too paranoid. Just consider me a frog at the bottom of the well, rambling on.” 

Gu Mo no longer had her earlier playful demeanor. 

It wasn’t that Sui Jingcheng’s reasoning was too correct for Rong Chang, but rather that a cultivator who had only traveled the Jianghu once in over thirty years had this kind of mindset, which proved she was definitely more willing to think than Gu Mo… 

Rong Chang smiled, “I have my own considerations.” 

After all, he was a Nascent Soul sword cultivator, often traveling down the mountain, and had experienced life-and-death battles of various realms many times. 

However, Sui Jingcheng’s reminder was not bad. 

It seemed that the little sister turning into the current Sui Jingcheng wasn’t entirely a bad thing. 

Back then, when the little sister caused a major incident, resulting in a rift between Floating Duck Sword Lake and the Yang family of Chongxuan Office's Yuntian Palace, after being submerged in the lake for half a year, Master Li Cai never allowed her to go out for training again. The little sister herself also didn’t want to go out, preferring to stay at Floating Duck Sword Lake to cultivate and becoming fond of solitude, completely ignoring worldly matters. The sect leader, Li Cai, along with the entire Floating Duck Sword Lake, felt a hint of unease; it wasn’t that the little sister’s cultivation had stagnated, but rather that her rapid breakthroughs posed a significant risk! 

In just twenty years, breaking through to the Dragon Gate and Golden Core bottlenecks, directly advancing to the Nascent Soul, this was the confidence Li Cai had to say that this favored disciple would certainly be among the top ten young cultivators of North Julu. However, even Rong Chang sensed a bit of instability, always feeling that such rapid breakthroughs could lead to great hidden dangers in the long run. Master Li Cai saw more clearly, which led to the little sister’s seclusion and the quiet departure of Taixia’s Yu Jun Li Yu to Wuling Nation. 

That day, Sui Jingcheng also handed Gu Mo a golden hairpin engraved with “Taixia Servant Ghost.” However, according to a secret agreement between her and Master Li Cai, Gu Mo wouldn’t take the hairpin back to the sect, but leave it with Rong Chang for safekeeping. As for the reason, Gu Mo didn’t know the deeper meaning, but Master Li Cai and Master Li Yu were close friends, and the flying sword Gu Mo refined was indeed, as Chen Pingan had guessed, a relic of a sword immortal from Floating Duck Sword Lake, passed on to Gu Mo by Li Cai. Therefore, Gu Mo was very familiar with this sword immortal, who was like an elder to her. 

Moreover, Sui Jingcheng finally obtained the middle and lower volumes of the “Supreme Mystical Collection.” 

The upper volume discussed the fundamental principles of this grand Dao technique, which would be a worthless book in the hands of an average Earth Immortal, but Sui Jingcheng had managed to refine it into a second realm bottleneck, even Rong Chang felt that Sui Jingcheng’s talent deserved to be called a prodigy. The middle volume contained the step-by-step cultivation mantras, which was truly a “Golden Core manual,” while the lower volume was key to reaching the top five realms. 

And Rong Chang also gave Sui Jingcheng a special jade token from the Patriarch Hall of Floating Duck Sword Lake, not only symbolizing her direct disciple status but also a common item that only upper five realm cultivators would possess. Rong Chang himself only had one such item. 

As the ferry sailed south, it passed through the Spring Dew Garden, stopping briefly, allowing passengers to disembark and explore the surrounding docks for about two hours. 

Qi Jinglong stepped off the ferry, while most passengers were soaring through the sky on their flying tools. 

Gu Mo shamelessly followed behind this land dragon, continuing to inquire about the mountain rumors regarding Qi Jinglong. If she returned to the sect, wouldn’t the flower-crazy sisters and junior sisters be envious? It wasn’t just her Taixia lineage; many female cultivators, including Zhi Xuan and Bai Yun, were practically drooling over this young sword immortal from Taihui, who looked more like a bookworm than a scholar. After whispering, when they turned around, each one of them was as cold as ice, showing no emotion, which amazed Gu Mo. 

Regardless, Gu Mo had already made up her mind that when she returned to the sect, she would say that Liu Jinglong was actually a hypocritical lecher who, upon seeing a woman, would stare at her chest and rear, particularly enamored by those who wore heavy makeup. This would infuriate those flower-crazy sisters who were too timid to go out after applying just a little powder, essentially helping them focus on their cultivation, right? Just to take it a step further, it would even save them the money spent on makeup! 

Thus, Gu Mo’s perception of this young sword immortal from Taihui had shifted from disliking him at first glance to increasingly finding him pleasing. 

Qi Jinglong bought some books from the symbol-water ferry bookstore in the Spring Dew Garden. After hesitating for a moment, he finally spoke, “Gu girl, though it may be inappropriate to say this, I really don’t like you.” 

Gu Mo was taken aback, her face flushing with anger, “Liu Jinglong, are you out of your mind?” 

Qi Jinglong chuckled instead of getting angry; it seemed to be effective! 

Gu Mo, somewhat flustered, began to seriously wonder if this was really Liu Jinglong? 

Qi Jinglong continued to stroll leisurely. 

Gu Mo, worried that he might be losing his mind, slowed her pace a bit, not daring to walk alongside him, let alone smile at him. 

Qi Jinglong turned back and smiled, “Gu girl, no need to be like this. We’re still friends.” 

Gu Mo nearly kicked him, but after weighing their cultivation levels, she managed to restrain herself, only gritting her teeth in frustration as she turned to leave. 

Qi Jinglong felt a bit sentimental. 

Compared to Chen Pingan, in such matters, it seemed he was still lacking in experience. 

But he should be on the right track. 

Sui Jingcheng went to the old locust street in Spring Dew Garden, exploring a small shop called “Ant.” 

She had heard her seniors and Mr. Liu mention this treasure before. 

Rong Chang naturally followed along. 

Sui Jingcheng, wearing a veil and holding her mountain-walking staff, stepped into the shop. The shopkeeper was warm and attentive, enthusiastically introducing the various treasures in the Ant shop without being annoying. 

Sui Jingcheng quietly asked, “Brother Rong, can I borrow some money from you?” 

Although she had received the direct disciple jade token, she was still a named disciple under Master Li Cai of Floating Duck Sword Lake, so calling Rong Chang “brother” was appropriate. 

Rong Chang chuckled mentally, “Master reserved a hundred Gu Yu coins for you, Sui junior sister, so feel free to spend. It’s not a loan. I have some savings too, so no need to return it.” 

Floating Duck Sword Lake and Chongxuan Office’s Yang family each held a portion of income from a small dragon palace cave paradise, with the remaining majority going to local forces. 

That dragon palace cave, one of the thirty-six small caves, was located deep at the bottom of the estuary, with a fantastical landscape that served as both a renowned tourist spot and an excellent place for Qi practitioners to practice water techniques. There were more than ten Earth Immortal practitioners renting residences there, and the income was enormous. Even with only a twenty percent share, Floating Duck Sword Lake would receive quite an impressive amount. 

Master Li Cai took not a single coin. 

All the divine money from the dragon palace cave, settled every sixty years, was treated as the family property of Floating Duck Sword Lake’s Patriarch Hall, distributed among all disciples except her according to their cultivation levels, talents, and contributions. 

This was Floating Duck Sword Lake. 

Rong Chang could guarantee that even if Master Li Cai were to lose her cultivation and no longer be a top-tier sword cultivator, the sect leader would still be Li Cai, and only Li Cai. 

In any case, Floating Duck Sword Lake was never short on money. 

Not to mention that Master Li Cai had always upheld the principle that female disciples must be well provided for to avoid being easily deceived by men. 

However, the hundred Gu Yu coins were half Master Li Cai’s personal funds, and the other half was what the Patriarch Hall should have allocated to the secluded little sister. 

Sui Jingcheng browsed through the various treasures in the Ant shop, picked a few clever trinkets that weren’t considered magical tools, bargained a bit, and spent only ten Gu Yu coins. 

Then she asked if there were any special treasures in the shop, even if they were more expensive, she didn’t mind. 

The young shopkeeper, who had come from Zhaoyecao Hall to help, remained enthusiastic and didn’t change his demeanor after the veiled woman only bought a few cheap items. He described several expensive items that weren’t displayed prominently in the shop. The dragon throne was off the table, but the young shopkeeper emphasized two gold crowns, one larger and one smaller, which could be sold separately. The larger one was eighteen Gu Yu coins, the smaller one was sixteen; if bought together, he would sell them for thirty-three Gu Yu coins. 

Sui Jingcheng asked, “Can I take a look first?” 

The young shopkeeper replied with a smile, “Of course. If they don’t catch your fancy, no need to buy them.” 

He circled around the counter to open the door. 

Rong Chang caught a glimpse of the writing on the door and couldn’t help but laugh. 

The four big characters read: “Fortune Favoured.” 

The four small characters read: “Highest Bidder Wins.” 

Rong Chang couldn’t connect this shopkeeper with the young man in green from the Dragon Head Ferry. 

At first glance, Sui Jingcheng immediately took a liking to the two gold crowns, didn’t bother to haggle, and asked Rong Chang to hand over thirty-three Gu Yu coins. 

With one hand exchanging money and the other receiving goods, Sui Jingcheng left the Ant shop, holding the wooden box made from locust wood crafted by Zhaoyecao Hall, walking along the old locust street with a light step and a good mood. 

The young shopkeeper bowed deeply, sending the two guests out of the shop. After watching them leave, he felt bewildered. 

In fact, this temporary shopkeeper felt a little guilty. 

Those two gold crowns, while genuine magical tools, were not worth the exorbitant price of thirty-three Gu Yu coins. 

Zhaoyecao Hall had privately estimated that while they were two magical items capable of summoning the protection of two Golden Body Goddesses, with effects similar to magical robes and also possessing some offensive capabilities, they were ultimately not a magical robe with a good appearance. Therefore, a price of around twenty-five Gu Yu coins would be more reasonable; even with some premium for an item that a female Earth Immortal favored, the peak would be around twenty-eight. 

The pricing for the gold crowns and the dragon throne was set by that sword immortal shopkeeper at the time, just in case they encountered a wealthy fool. 

Zhaoyecao Hall was also helpless about this, feeling it would collect dust for at least a hundred or two hundred years. 

Unexpectedly, how long had it been since then? 

After leaving Old Locust Street, Rong Chang smiled, “You overpaid.” 

Sui Jingcheng felt a bit embarrassed. 

But she really liked those gold crowns! 

Sui Jingcheng whispered, “Brother Rong, I guarantee I won’t buy anything else now.” 

“I didn’t mean to blame the junior sister.” 

Rong Chang shook his head, smiling, “When our master buys things, he’s also generous. Once he took a fancy to a particularly beautiful magical robe, insisting that the seller raise the price; otherwise, he wouldn’t buy it. At that time, Master did not reveal his identity, and the seller was scared half to death, thinking he had encountered a scene that would ruin their business. After learning it was our master later, they regretted it deeply, beating their chest and stomping their feet, feeling they should have doubled the price.” 

Sui Jingcheng sighed sincerely, “If I had known, I would have gone to Floating Duck Sword Lake first.” 

Rong Chang felt relieved. 

Damn it, with the little sister saying this, if Master Li Cai were present, she would definitely ask Rong Chang if he had any magical treasures he wanted to buy recently. 

Upon returning to the ferry, the two had just taken their seats when Rong Chang needed to teach her a sword refining technique from Floating Duck Sword Lake regarding the refining of the two exquisite gold crowns. 

If a sword could be refined, then all things could be refined. 

After explaining the sword refining technique in detail, Sui Jingcheng closed her eyes. When she opened them again, she smiled, “Got it.” 

Rong Chang stopped reiterating. 

The little sister back then had turned into the current Sui Jingcheng now, although their personalities were vastly different, they were still equally talented in cultivation; she would not disappoint him. 

However, Sui Jingcheng still asked Rong Chang to repeat it once more, just to avoid any mistakes. 

Then Gu Mo began knocking on the door loudly from the corridor, creating a commotion. 

When Sui Jingcheng opened the door, Gu Mo rushed in, “Sui Jingcheng, Sui Jingcheng, I have a secret to tell you! Liu Jinglong may have been swapped out; the one we see now might be another person!” 

Sui Jingcheng was utterly confused and turned to look at Rong Chang. 

Rong Chang felt helpless and told Gu Mo, “Stop talking nonsense.” 

Gu Mo plopped down onto a chair, pondering deeply for a long time, and then suddenly exclaimed, “Oh, so that shameless bastard was just toying with me!” 

Rong Chang got up to leave. 

Gu Mo had been unsettled throughout this entire journey, but Rong Chang couldn’t say much. 

Fortunately, this trip to the Dragon Head Ferry had helped Gu Mo’s mindset return to the Daoist ideal of tranquility; that was a good thing. 

Those two cultivators who seemed like Mr. Green had contributed greatly. 

Of course, Sui Jingcheng also played a part. 

After Rong Chang closed the door, Gu Mo recounted the events to Sui Jingcheng. 

Sui Jingcheng pressed her hand to her forehead, not wanting to speak. 

Both of you have high cultivation! How could you two be so oblivious? 

And that Mr. Liu as well; had he truly become foolish from reading too much? How could he have spent so much time with seniors and not learned anything good? 

As expected, seniors were right; a cultivator’s realm truly couldn’t be eaten like a meal. 

Gu Mo asked in confusion, “What’s wrong? You tell me; could there be some hidden profundity? I’m still a fresh flower young lady; in such matters, my experience is far inferior to yours.” 

Sui Jingcheng blushed, “What are you talking about?” 

Gu Mo sighed, “Forget it.” 

Gu Mo lay her head on the table, glancing out the window at the sea of clouds. 

Sui Jingcheng placed the delicate little gold crown on the table and, like Gu Mo, lay her head down on her arms, lightly tapping the crown with her fingers. 

Gu Mo softly said, “I miss Master a bit. What about you? Do you miss that man?” 

Sui Jingcheng murmured, “If you don’t mention it, I might miss him. But once it’s brought up, it doesn’t feel like I miss him as much anymore. Isn’t that strange?” 

Gu Mo helplessly replied, “How would I know?” 

The two fell silent. 

Suddenly, Gu Mo’s eyes lit up. She stood, moved a chair, and hurriedly sat beside Sui Jingcheng, whispering in her ear, “Sui Jingcheng, let me tell you, there are many ways for dual cultivation, and it’s not at all lewd; it’s one of the branches of Daoism, completely legitimate. Otherwise, why would those mountain partners want to marry each other, right? I know some things, like…” 

Sui Jingcheng listened for a moment before pushing Gu Mo away, fuming, “Why are you so lewd?!” 

Gu Mo protested, “I’m just saying what I heard!” 

Sui Jingcheng’s face turned crimson as she suddenly stood up and chased Gu Mo out of the room. 

With a loud bang, she shut the door. 

Gu Mo coughed lightly and imitated that Chen guy’s tone, “Jingcheng, I’m here. Open the door.” 

Sui Jingcheng shouted angrily, “Gu Mo!” 

Gu Mo continued in the same tone, “Jingcheng, why have you become so unruly? Call me senior.” 

Sui Jingcheng looked around, grabbed her mountain-walking staff, opened the door, and prepared to hit Gu Mo. 

Gu Mo had already skipped away, peeking her head around the corner, grinning, “Oh, the way you look right now would make any girl’s heart flutter. I think that guy, after walking with you, must have had trouble keeping his eyes to himself. It’s just that he has a higher cultivation, and you’re lower, so he didn’t notice. Ah, I just don’t know whether you’ve made a big loss or a big gain.” 

Sui Jingcheng was so angry she wanted to chase her. 

Gu Mo had already happily returned to her own room, feeling in great spirits. 

Sui Jingcheng closed the door, leaned against it, smiled sweetly, sat at the table, and picked up the gold crown while holding a copper mirror. 

After that, she took off the gold crown, put away the copper mirror, and began to carefully flip through the middle volume of the “Supreme Mystical Collection.” 

Cultivators. 

Lose track of time. 

Those who had just stepped onto the path of cultivation would often lose their sense of time’s passage. 

That night, Sui Jingcheng finished reading the last volume of the “Supreme Mystical Collection” and turned to look out the window. 

The crescent moon and the phoenix tree, sudden rain on the banana leaves, geese in the autumn wind, spring grass and horse hooves, snow on a flat boat, childhood sweethearts, talented scholars and beautiful women, famous generals and precious swords, beautiful mirrors… 

So many perfect matches in the world. 

What about Sui Jingcheng and the senior? 

Qi Jinglong was flipping through a book he purchased from the symbol-water ferry, which was a miscellaneous book about the porcelain manufacturing of various continents and countries, published by the most business-savvy sect in North Julu, the Qionglin Sect. 

He suddenly frowned. 

Closing the book. 

He closed his eyes. 

At the Dragon Head Ferry Inn, Chen Pingan had discussed many things with him, most of which were mentioned in passing, without revealing too much. 

There was the cross-continental ferry that crashed at Da Jiao Mountain, the Ants of Southeast North Julu, and the matter of his hometown, Li Zhu Cave’s life porcelain. 

These topics were mixed in with many others, not standing out. Chen Pingan didn’t seem to deliberately seek any answers, more like casual conversations between friends. 

But Qi Jinglong was not foolish. 

There was a thread hidden within, something Chen Pingan might not have even realized himself. 

The ferry from Da Jiao Mountain, Mr. Jianweng, one of the ten oddities of North Julu, was missing, and the ferry crashed in the most powerful Zhu Ying Dynasty of the Treasure Bottle Continent. North Julu was enraged, and the Heavenly Lord Xie Shi descended to the Treasure Bottle Continent, first returning to his old country, the Da Li Dynasty’s Li Zhu Cave, and then heading to the central part of the Treasure Bottle Continent, engaging in challenges from the Three-Seventy-Two Academies, eventually leading the Da Li iron cavalry south, creating a sweeping force across the continent. 

In North Julu’s major sects, the matter regarding Li Zhu Cave’s life porcelain was not a secret; Chen Pingan initially referred to himself with a slight change, modifying “Qi” to “Liu,” and finally changing it to “Qi Jinglong,” rather than “Liu Jinglong.” 

Now that Chen Pingan had just reached the third realm of Qi cultivation, he must rely on the life item belonging to the five elements to rebuild the Everlasting Bridge. Chen Pingan’s knowledge was eclectic, yet he sought a balance, putting in great effort into cultivating his heart. 

Qi Jinglong sighed heavily and stood up, moving to the window. 

He believed that Chen Pingan’s journey through North Julu definitely held some profound scheme behind it, and he needed to be cautious every step of the way. This was more delicate than his already intricate facade while traversing the Jianghu. 

Qi Jinglong muttered to himself, “Could it be that your life porcelain is now in the hands of a major sect in North Julu? If so, you need to be extra careful. The higher your realm becomes, the more careful you must be.” 

Qi Jinglong’s mood grew heavy; while in the prosperous Ai Ai Continent, everything could be negotiated with money, in North Julu, it was much more complicated. 

Especially as an outsider, wanting to reason with people in North Julu was especially challenging. 

Qi Jinglong certainly didn’t mind standing beside Chen Pingan, but the price would either be him leaving the Taihui Sword Sect or dragging down its reputation. 

Once Qi Jinglong got involved, the trouble would become greater. 

It might even attract more sword immortals who had previously chosen to watch from the sidelines. 

This was the terrifying nature of rules. 

North Julu preferred to band together; when something could be right or wrong, and didn’t involve absolute good or evil, if an outsider tried to rely on their identity to act, it would be a mistake. For the many sword immortals of North Julu, that meant they were inviting them to draw their swords. 

Historically, in Ai Ai Continent, the Liu family patriarch and the Dragon Tiger Mountain Celestial Master had both tried to land in North Julu to personally investigate the culprit, but what happened? More than a hundred upper realm sword cultivators blockaded the area, without anyone shouting or calling for help; they all gathered on the shore, floating swords at the ready, and without exception, no one spoke a word, only drew their swords. 

In this matter, the Outsider, including the Fire Dragon True Man, never intervened. Even if Fire Dragon True Man was likely the legendary great celestial master from Dragon Tiger Mountain, he had no intention of mediating or speaking on behalf. 

Moreover, once the fighting began, if a sword cultivator chose to deliver the first strike, then it would become a no-retreat situation. 

Every time a sword cultivator died, it was likely that two more would quickly arrive on the battlefield. 

This was why North Julu, despite being located in the northeast, forcibly took the “North” character from Ai Ai Continent. 

Unconvinced? 

After a great conflict, the Ai Ai Continent erupted with disputes, and the cultivators of North Julu were severely insulted by the Ai Ai cultivators who perished at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Not only that, but they also threatened to expel all North Julu cultivators from their territory. 

When a group of over two hundred sword cultivators from North Julu prepared to travel to Ai Ai Continent, there were ten upper realm sword cultivators among them. 

Before departing, they didn’t utter a single harsh word against Ai Ai Continent; they simply banded together and prepared to cross the continents. 

Among them, half of the upper realm sword cultivators had honed their skills at the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

When Ai Ai Continent suddenly learned that two hundred sword cultivators from North Julu were only three thousand miles from their coast, nearly all the sects were thrown into chaos. 

Because the other side declared they would challenge Ai Ai Continent with their swords without delay, and everyone would get a share, as for the “North” character you’re so fond of, just leave it be. 

Among this group of sword cultivators seeking to “expand their territory,” there were also many others setting off to the west. 

In the end, an old scholar blocked the path of the sword cultivators. 

No one knew what the old scholar said when facing more than two hundred sword cultivators. 

But ultimately, the sword cultivators of North Julu did not land on a large scale; they chose to retreat back to their continent. 

After that, Ai Ai Continent lost its “North” character. 

Qi Jinglong recalled these past events. Even though he hadn’t experienced them firsthand, he had heard stories from sect elders, and he couldn’t help but feel yearning. 

However, the two sword immortals from Taihui Sword Sect were among those who would travel across continents, yet they never spoke much about it. 

Qi Jinglong only heard the sect elders mention that the two sword immortals had disputes over who would guard the sect and who would travel across the continent to draw their swords, one saying you’re the sect leader, so you should stay, while the other would argue you’re not as skilled as I am; don’t go embarrass yourself. 

Qi Jinglong began to contemplate various possibilities, both the best and worst scenarios, along with many variations in between. 

This was the same line of thinking that Chen Pingan used to view the various dilemmas. 

But Qi Jinglong pondered for a long time, feeling that this was likely a complex situation that could involve many parties. 

Thus, Qi Jinglong decided to collect more information before proceeding. 

It was important to help without causing trouble. 

Qi Jinglong returned to his seat. 

The Qionglin Sect would be a good starting point. 

Because this wealth-rolling sect was full of mixed characters, gathering information from them wouldn’t raise any alarms. 

There was also a sect that had been on good terms with Taihui Sword Sect for generations, which was said to have dealt in Li Zhu Cave’s life porcelain, providing a roundabout way to investigate. 

In addition, Qi Jinglong had some ideas. 

Simply put, it was about taking things step by step, pursuing a slow yet error-free strategy, seeking victory through stability. 

After Qi Jinglong formed a rough outline, he poured himself a cup of tea. 

Among the ten young cultivators of North Julu today, the Chongxuan Office’s Yang Ningzhen and Yang Ningxing brothers, of course, Qi Jinglong was very familiar with. 

Especially Yang Ningzhen, who went to practice martial arts; he was someone who liked to delve into the nitty-gritty. 

Yang Ningxing ranked ninth, while his brother Yang Ningzhen was at the bottom. However, in reality, Yang Ningzhen could move up a few ranks. 

The one ranked fourth, right behind Qi Jinglong, was named Huang Xi. 

He was a wild cultivator from the mountains, the youngest Nascent Soul wild cultivator in North Julu’s history, known for being especially capable of wearing down opponents bit by bit. However, even a Yu Pu realm sword cultivator would find it difficult to kill him. He relied on both his magical abilities and a semi-immortal weapon he had fought hard to obtain, as well as a semi-immortal weapon “picked up” during an earlier opportunity—one offensive and one defensive. Moreover, this person had a gloomy temperament, was very shrewd, and bore grudges, earning the title of North Julu’s local Jiang Shangzhen. 

In one instance of revenge, he single-handedly slaughtered a second-rate immortal sect, leaving no survivors. 

What was frightening was that he didn’t choose to storm the gates directly; instead, he infiltrated three times, calculating human hearts to a terrifying degree. 

When a Yu Pu realm sword immortal and the others arrived, he had just distanced himself, and the elder of that immortal sect had just breathed his last, with his Golden Core stripped away and his life essence ignited, left to burn on the roof of the Patriarch Hall. 

On the battlefield, countless soul lamps of cultivators burned, some extinguished and turned to ash, while others still had remnants of their souls. 

A once vibrant immortal mountain now emanated a terrifying aura, akin to a ghostly lair. 

Qi Jinglong had crossed paths with him once. 

He had even drawn his sword. 

But that person fought while retreating, and even exchanged some heartfelt words with Qi Jinglong, along with some insider gossip he had never heard before. 

Among them was the warning regarding distraction. 

This wild cultivator was named Huang Xi. 

Huang Xi had also performed some inexplicable feats. In any case, this person’s actions were hard to distinguish between right and wrong. 

As for the two people who ranked above Qi Jinglong? 

The first one, he didn’t want to think too much about. 

As long as he was willing to act, the opponent would certainly lose, even if they were one realm higher; this was undeniable. 

This was even if he didn’t use those recognized semi-immortal weapons. 

Even Qi Jinglong himself felt a bit awed. 

But he wouldn’t let that discourage him. 

On the path of the Dao, there’s always someone better. 

Moreover, Qi Jinglong firmly believed that as long as he and that person didn’t let the gap between them widen too much, there would be a chance to catch up. 

As for the second person, named Xu Xuan. 

Before this person was even born, several sects were already on alert and ready to move. It was said that even outside experts from the Central Divine Continent were peeking in. 

This must be deeply entangled. 

Xu Xuan’s life item, refined into five elemental properties, was extraordinary, grand in its aura, and spectacular. 

He had two personal maids, one specifically tasked with carrying his blade, named Ke Zhu, and the other with carrying his sword, named Fu He. 

He was the only disciple of Bai Chang, the first sword immortal from North Julu. 

Thus, Xu Xuan was both Bai Chang’s eldest disciple and a secluded disciple. 

There were few rumors about Xu Xuan. 

But each one was astonishing. 

For example, he was actually half the master of the Qionglin Sect, and the sect’s business had long reached the Treasure Bottle Continent and even the Tongye Continent. 

Another rumor was that one of his ambitions was to defeat his master, Bai Chang. 

The latest major rumor was that Xu Xuan hoped to marry the Cheng Ling Sect’s female sect leader, He Xiaoliang. If she agreed, Xu Xuan would be willing to leave the sect and join the Cheng Ling Sect. 

Yet whether it was the disciple claiming he wanted to defeat his master or leaving the sect, the great sword immortal Bai Chang remained unmoved, only hearing that he was currently in seclusion, attempting to break through the immortal realm bottleneck. This was likely the reason Bai Chang did not join the expedition to the Upside-Down Mountain. No one would doubt Bai Chang’s boldness, for in his lifetime, he had two times thrown himself onto the Sword Qi Great Wall, staying there for nearly seventy years. 

Since Xu Xuan had never drawn his sword, North Julu still didn’t dare to determine whether he was a sword cultivator, let alone what his life sword looked like. 

Yet no one questioned Xu Xuan’s position as the second-best among the young ten. 

Because Xu Xuan had broken through to the cave-dwelling realm, then the Golden Core realm, and finally the Nascent Soul realm, each time causing grand phenomena to occur. 

Some claimed Xu Xuan had actually reached the upper five realms long ago, but Bai Chang had personally intervened to suppress all phenomena. 

Moreover, Xu Xuan was the youngest among the ten. 

He was three years younger than Huang Xi, who ranked fourth. 

Following him was Liu Jinglong from Taihui Sword Sect. 

The fifth was a female martial artist, and if not counting Yang Ningzhen, she was the only pure martial artist on the list. 

The sixth had already perished. The sect had pursued the matter for over a decade without any conclusion. 

The seventh had fought against someone in the Tili Mountain battle, both sustaining injuries that affected their foundations. The so-called top ten had lost its meaning. 

The opponent was an aging Nascent Soul sword cultivator from a rival sect, clearly intending to sacrifice his own life to ruin this young prodigy’s path to the Dao. 

Since it was clear it was a trap, and they couldn’t resist the urge to fight, this was the outcome; the path to Dao has always been merciless. 

The eighth was that Water Journey Mountain’s Lu Fairy. 

However, there were now rumors of several newcomers from the mountains who had emerged suddenly and were fully qualified to be among the top ten, even with not low ranks. 

Qi Jinglong flipped through some calligraphy and painting collections. 

Recently, he had been studying the brush techniques and methods of the cursive script. 

This was practicing swordsmanship. 

Observing the artistic expressions and line drawings from renowned painters was also practicing swordsmanship. 

When reading, he flipped to a line about “green moss left for birds,” which was also a form of sword intent. 

Qi Jinglong had always believed that the so-called reasoning would be a process from complexity to simplicity, flowing naturally. 

Just as reading thick books before thin ones might lead to a few pithy phrases that could accompany a lifetime, benefiting them endlessly. 

Moreover, supporting the foundational principles of a wealth of knowledge, like the beams and rafters of a house, mutually supporting, yet not conflicting; ultimately, the heart of the Dao rises like a white jade capital, layer upon layer, reaching into the clouds, and the house can expand in area as the understanding of the rules grows, so-called limited freedom naturally approaches absolute freedom. 

In the dead of night, Qi Jinglong had been reading by lamplight for a while. 

Everyone thought he was distracted. 

Fortunately, there were those who did not think so. 

A figure in a blue robe was drifting upstream along a great river. 

As autumn arrived, Chen Pingan suddenly found an old, renowned tavern in the Jianghu and ordered a signature hotpot. 

Many Jianghu heroes there were shouting in delight, sweating profusely yet still eating with gusto. 

Among them, one man who appeared to be well-read, drunk beyond measure, said something out of the blue. 

This prompted Chen Pingan to order another jug of wine. 

The man said, “The weak huddle around the cauldron in deep waters, while the strong feast at the table.” 

Chen Pingan drank heartily, feeling that Elder Song was right; the hotpot and wine, this flavor is truly unique in the world. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 622: Calmness Without Malice

An old and a young Daoist walked along the banks of the Great Marsh in the Central Land. The autumn wind howled, and the old Daoist conversed with his disciple about meeting an old friend.

The young disciple didn't inquire further about the identity or cultivation level of this friend, as it wasn't necessary. Years ago, on a solitary island far from the mainland, a scholar had turned them away at the door.

Reflecting on his master's cultivation, the young Daoist felt a mix of emotions, especially upon hearing that the scholar was neither an immortal of the Earth nor someone of significant status like those at the Jade Purity level or the Ascended Realm. The young man had initially wanted to offer words of comfort to his master, but seeing the old man appear so indifferent, he decided against it. After all, if his master’s abilities to slay demons were lacking, it might be understandable given his own inadequate skills.

Later, after his master took him ashore to the Central Land, they visited the Dragon Tiger Mountain, the main sect of their lineage. Yet, the young disciple was left at the foot of the mountain while the old Daoist ascended alone. The young man felt some regret but assumed his master simply lacked the connections to bring him along. His master mentioned that this trip was to discuss something with the noblemen of Huang and Zi. If successful, then the young disciple would have his chance to climb the mountain. He urged his master to be tactful and not act so rashly as he did at their home mountain, as his visit to the Heavenly Master’s Office would depend entirely on his master.

The old Daoist reassured him that there was nothing to worry about regarding his master's abilities.

The young disciple shot a resentful glance, thinking about his years of hard work at the Ground Peak. What had his master accomplished? Whenever other Daoists came to discuss matters with the old man, he would either be fast asleep or would leave the young disciple and a few senior brothers to deal with them. Over time, the Daoists from the Tai Xia, Bai Yun, and Zhi Xuan sects would sigh and turn away as soon as they spotted him. While helping his master alleviate worries was a noble duty, repeatedly shielding him from disaster began to feel excessive.

Not long after, the old Daoist returned from the mountain, stating that the mission had failed, which meant the disciple wouldn't have a chance to visit the Heavenly Master’s Office.

The young disciple offered some comforting words to his master. The old man was deeply grateful and expressed his sentiments, saying, "Ah, Mountain Peak, a disciple like you is truly like a warm coat for the master."

The young disciple looked up at the distant Dragon Tiger Mountain, where ethereal mists swirled, cranes called out, and precious lights flickered. He felt a twinge of disappointment. But this disappointment was not directed at his master; it was directed at himself. Following his master’s advice, he had left their mountain to explore farther afield, seeking new sights. After a journey, he became lost in thought and didn't want to return to the sect empty-handed. So he bit the bullet, took out nearly all his celestial coins, and boarded a ferry to the distant Baoping Continent. There, he made friends, encountered new faces, and experienced separations and reunions.

Through these experiences, the young disciple gained clarity on many matters. He found himself increasingly grateful to his master.

The old Daoist stopped at a certain spot along the marsh and said to wait a moment. 

Zhang Shanfeng, the young disciple, stood beside him with a bamboo box and whispered, "Master, are we visiting without any gifts?"

The old Daoist, adorned in a robe embroidered with two fiery dragons, sighed, "In my haste to travel, I forgot."

Zhang Shanfeng sighed, "Even a few snowflake coins would be a humble gift, Master. Aren't we being a bit too careless? Next time you visit a friend, let me know in advance, and I’ll prepare something."

The old Daoist pondered for a moment and nodded in agreement. He held back from revealing the truth, knowing that if they brought gifts, the Great Marsh Water God might misunderstand and think they were trying to bribe him, which could lead to serious consequences. This water god, although the first of the water deity temples of the Grand Dynasty, had a notorious reputation for being difficult to deal with. In the past, he had burned the Great Marsh, and only after the water level fell significantly did he kneel and beg for mercy.

At this moment, the old Daoist, using a concealment technique, revealed a slight aura.

Soon, an elder in a golden robe arrived from the water, stepping ashore without uttering a word. He felt nervous and apprehensive, fearing that if he let his guard down, he might kneel and weep, uttering flattering words that could anger the old immortal, thus inviting disaster. Despite being a prominent water god in this dynasty, he had a reputation for being tough, having fought fiercely with several powerful cultivators in the past, but he held a different demeanor when facing the Fire Dragon Immortal.

Usually, powerful cultivators would at most injure his golden body with spells and magical treasures, relying on incense and water fortune to repair the damage. However, the Fire Dragon Immortal could shatter his golden body into pieces, rendering him utterly powerless.

Moreover, the two had a longstanding grudge.

It wasn't uncommon for cultivators to seek revenge, even after centuries.

As for why the Fire Dragon Immortal could act freely against a water deity while the Central Land Academy held few restrictions over the old immortal, it was rather strange.

The young disciple glanced at the cold demeanor of the elder, who looked like a recluse cultivating in this place. He silently blamed his master for lacking any celebratory atmosphere upon meeting an old friend. Did his master feel embarrassed about losing face at Dragon Tiger Mountain and want to find a connection here in the marsh to show off his broad social network? In reality, the young disciple felt a sense of pity for his master.

"Master?" Zhang Shanfeng cleared his throat.

The wandering Fire Dragon Immortal looked up and smiled, "It's been a long time since we last met."

The elder in golden robe swallowed hard, forcing a strained smile, "Indeed, it has been a long time."

The Fire Dragon Immortal had no interest in idle conversation and stated directly, "I’ve come to request a vial of water elixir."

The elder nearly broke down in tears on the spot.

It was just a vial of the Water God’s elixir from the Great Marsh. Surely, he didn't need to personally appear to convey such a trivial message? Walking these extra miles was merely a waste of the old immortal's time. Did he not realize that just by appearing, he nearly frightened the little god half to death?

The elder felt a wave of relief wash over him. He turned to hold a banquet in the Water God’s Palace. After all, for over a thousand years, he had been constantly worried that the next time he met the Fire Dragon Immortal, he might not survive the encounter. Yet, who would have thought that a mere vial of elixir could settle everything? Of course, this was only for the Fire Dragon Immortal, a peak Ascendant; regular cultivators proficient in fire techniques wouldn't dare to speak so boldly. As a high-ranking water god, he could escape if things turned dangerous by taking to the water; after all, if the situation escalated, neither the dynasty nor the academy would stand idle.

Thus, the elder immediately produced a porcelain vial, carefully asking, "Is one vial sufficient?"

The Fire Dragon Immortal smiled, "What do you think?"

Without hesitation, the elder produced another vial of the marsh’s essence elixir.

The Fire Dragon Immortal actually only needed one, but he suddenly thought of someone in the Baiyun lineage who might require it to break through, so he decided not to refuse.

Zhang Shanfeng gently tugged at his master's sleeve.

The Fire Dragon Immortal smiled, "Your friend has given you such a generous gift and treated you with sincerity. Although I once gifted him something, in terms of hierarchy, it was not enough. So I plan to gift him another vial of elixir. This not only helps you repay a favor but also cuts some ties. The other vial is for your senior brother from the Baiyun lineage."

Zhang Shanfeng didn't fully understand the significance of his master’s past gift and ties. However, the thought that Chen Pingan would receive an extra vial of elixir felt like tremendous good fortune.

The Fire Dragon Immortal didn’t mind that this disciple was connected to that young man. They walked the same path of enlightenment, but some petty connections still needed to be sorted out.

As the Fire Dragon Immortal took the two vials of elixir, he subtly left behind a fine fire dragon in the Water God’s palm to help him refine his divine body.

When receiving benefits, one must return the favor.

Moreover, as for Chen Pingan, the Fire Dragon Immortal had previously been reluctant to help him advance prematurely; in fact, both Zhang Shanfeng and the Fire Dragon Immortal owed him a favor.

The first was the seal personally carved by the last great heavenly master, which wasn't valuable but held profound significance for Zhang Shanfeng. This was the connection of the Dao.

For cultivators, the connection of the Dao was the most important, far more than treasures and magical weapons.

The second was that sword, which represented another aspect of their connection.

Also, it was an important reason why the Fire Dragon Immortal was willing to refrain from causing a scene at the Heavenly Master’s Office after his request yielded no results.

This time, according to the agreement to ascend the mountain, the Fire Dragon Immortal hoped Zhang Shanfeng would receive the approval of the current great heavenly master of the Heavenly Master’s Office to inherit the title "heavenly master from an external clan."

However, the Heavenly Master’s Office acknowledged that Zhang Shanfeng's future was promising but felt that the signs of chaos were already emerging in the world, and thus, he was destined to remain a mere footnote for at least a hundred years. Moreover, the Heavenly Master’s Office had found two candidates for external clan heavenly masters in the past millennium, so they did not accept the Fire Dragon Immortal's proposal. Thus, once the Fire Dragon Immortal truly ascended in the Northern Continent, the Central Land’s Dragon Tiger Mountain would appoint an external clan heavenly master that day. Though he would be far inferior compared to the Fire Dragon Immortal, he would undoubtedly be much stronger than Zhang Shanfeng.

In the ancestral hall of the Heavenly Master’s Office, apart from the calm-faced great heavenly master, nearly all the noblemen of Huang and Zi felt uneasy and fearful.

They were afraid the Fire Dragon Immortal might act on impulse.

Fortunately, the old immortal silently descended the mountain, taking Zhang Shanfeng away from the Dragon Tiger Mountain territory.

By the Great Marsh, the elder in the golden robe was ecstatic and wanted to kneel in gratitude, but the Fire Dragon Immortal signaled him with his eyes not to make a scene.

The elder quickly steadied himself.

Zhang Shanfeng received the two vials of elixir from the Fire Dragon Immortal and tucked them away, smiling brightly.

Finally, he could do something for Chen Pingan, right? After all, he had eaten and drunk his way through many adventures and owed Chen Pingan a great deal. The delayed payment for the Dew Armor in the Ghost Mansion of Caiyi Country, the sword still owed at the ferry of Shushui Country, and later, when caught in a dire situation in Qingluan Country with Xu Yuanxia, it was Chen Pingan who had come to his rescue.

The Fire Dragon Immortal glanced at the elder in the golden robe, who immediately understood. He gritted his teeth and produced the last vial of elixir he carried, handing it to the young disciple.

Was he just a lower-level cultivator?

Was he truly the proud disciple of the Fire Dragon Immortal? Although the Fire Dragon Immortal had a peculiar temperament and never judged his disciples based on talent, the fact that he was willing to travel with this disciple through the Central Land indicated that the disciple was far from ordinary.

The young disciple felt a bit embarrassed, thinking he didn’t deserve to accept the vial, but he also didn’t want to seem ungrateful, so he feigned modesty.

The elder in the golden robe boasted shamelessly that this elixir was the least valuable item in his possession, and since it was their first meeting, he should be the one to give a gift.

He didn’t dare to say he was a senior by a few years, as that would imply he had to be on the same level as the Fire Dragon Immortal.

Zhang Shanfeng had already resolved not to accept it, but the Fire Dragon Immortal advised him to take it, saying he could repay it someday when he had the chance to travel the Central Land on his own.

The words "repay the favor" made the golden-robed water god's scalp tingle with fear. He was terrified of being indebted; after all, he was just a small water god and couldn't afford to owe a debt.

He guessed that the Fire Dragon Immortal had some connection to Dragon Tiger Mountain. After all, in the millennium following the Fire Dragon Immortal's burning of the Great Marsh, many noblemen of Huang and Zi from the Heavenly Master’s Office would descend to travel and pay homage to the battlefield.

Finally, Zhang Shanfeng accepted the third vial of elixir, bowing in thanks.

The elder in the golden robe dared not linger and quickly took his leave.

He needed to refine his divine body with the fire dragon gifted by the old immortal. Before that, he had to order all the aquatic spirits in his domain to return to their hiding places immediately. Anyone who couldn't keep their legs in check would have to face the consequences from him, the Great Marsh Water God.

The Fire Dragon Immortal continued on foot with Zhang Shanfeng.

He spoke some heavy words but didn’t elaborate further to his disciple. 

That Chen Pingan was deeply entangled with the Northern Continent, and it was easy for this disciple to be dragged into it. 

Believing that the young man would not pull Zhang Shanfeng into danger even if he found himself in dire straits, the complexity of the world was such that if Chen Pingan took action, his disciple would certainly have his own opinions and would unhesitatingly dive into the fray. 

At that time, would he, as a master, allow the Northern Continent’s sword immortals to set sail together unimpeded against the forces from Dragon Tiger Mountain’s Heavenly Master’s Office? Or would he break the rules and descend the mountain to assist his disciple and that young man?

He had to admit that many of the Dao principles esteemed by Lu Chen were indeed quite absurd at first glance but, when scrutinized over a millennium, contained profound truths.

Cultivation on the mountain, with everyone cultivating alongside, was inherently pure and peaceful, leading to either ascension or reincarnation.

Once those on the mountain determined the fate of those below based on personal preference amidst the myriad philosophies, it would only lead to greater chaos.

Everyone spoke reason, yet no one adhered to it. Everyone had their own reasoning, yet none could be considered true Daoists.

The Fire Dragon Immortal had once ventured to the Qingming realm under certain circumstances in his early years.

He had seen both the merits and flaws of the Daoists in that realm, who were unwaveringly direct, as well as the merits and flaws of the Confucians, who were entangled in the web of human emotions.

Indeed, the Daoists of Qingming had a white jade capital that resisted the ethereal outlaws of the outside world, while the righteous realm defended against the wild lands with their Sword Qi Great Wall and Hanging Mountain—there was a great principle behind it.

The young Daoist suddenly chuckled, "Master, having traversed the Central Land, I am now like Chen Pingan, someone who has walked through three continents."

The Fire Dragon Immortal nodded with a smile, "Quite an achievement."

Zhang Shanfeng asked, "Are the Qi practitioners of Baoping Continent's younger generation not as strong as those from our side?"

The Fire Dragon Immortal replied, "The gap between the two continents in terms of talent is merely a matter of decades. If we look again in the future, everyone will see that the younger generation of Baoping Continent will increasingly stand out. However, it must be said that the fortunes of a continent are fixed, but the abundance of spiritual energy is not predetermined. The more prosperous the continent, the more that young talents will emerge like bamboo shoots after a rain. Therefore, for Baoping Continent to gain recognition from the other eight continents, it will need a bit of luck. For now, your master's old friend, whom we now call Li Liu, will undoubtedly excel; no one can stop that. Ma Ku Xuan is also a uniquely gifted individual, and the woman he assists is no exception. These three are relatively less surprising, so I mention them specifically. However, less surprising does not mean no surprises."

Zhang Shanfeng laughed, "Chen Pingan will surely stand out too, right?"

The Fire Dragon Immortal nodded, "He should be among them. Yet, the ultimate heights remain uncertain due to many variables."

Zhang Shanfeng said, "Master, I have a good eye, don't I? The first friend I made on Baoping Continent was Chen Pingan."

The Fire Dragon Immortal remarked, "I think Chen Pingan has a good eye as well."

Zhang Shanfeng pondered, "Chen Pingan's choice of friends is decent, but your choice of disciples might not be as good. After all, some of the senior brothers and sisters who came from Ground Peak are still quite impressive."

The Fire Dragon Immortal fell silent for a moment before smiling, "Mountain Peak, remember one thing."

Zhang Shanfeng was curious, "What is it, Master?"

The old immortal sighed, "In the future, when you take on disciples and impart the Dao to them, remember not to assume that anyone can become a peak cultivator and thus favor them excessively. Rather, it is the many merits of these disciples that may surpass even those of their master, which will inevitably give them greater opportunities to ascend the mountain. You should appreciate them more. The order of preference should not be reversed. Talent is never absolute. Everything flourishes in various forms; there is no singular landscape. Many ancestors of famed sects have become stagnant in their thinking through years of cultivation, failing to recognize this small detail, resulting in a mountain devoid of human warmth."

The old immortal turned and noticed his disciple trying to suppress a laugh. "What’s amusing?"

Zhang Shanfeng chuckled, "Master, with my current level of Dao, how could I dare to take on disciples? Wouldn’t that mislead them?"

The old immortal laughed, "Take your time; there’s no rush."

The transmission of the Dao is akin to passing on a flame.

Perhaps it has never been a significant matter, merely that someone lights a small flame first, which, though faint, can ignite a beacon for those who follow in the dark.

Otherwise, the world would forever be shrouded in darkness.

Dao gives birth to One.

One gives birth to Two; Two gives birth to Three; Three gives birth to all things.

"Mountain Peak, would you like to ride on the celestial ferry of the Qiongyou sect? We could cross continents southward and explore Southern Posa Continent; the scenery along the way is quite beautiful."

"Master, let’s refrain from pretending to be affluent," Zhang Shanfeng replied.

"But a friend over there has invited me over, and I can’t refuse such hospitality."

"Then I think your friend likely has only a mediocre relationship with you, otherwise they wouldn’t be unaware of your financial constraints."

"Mountain Peak, if it comes to that, you might have to endure some hardships. My skills in slaying demons and dispelling evil are indeed somewhat lacking, but you have experienced my teleportation technique."

"Then let’s take the ferry to cross the continent; wealth is but an external matter. Before boarding, I’ll prepare some dried rations and pickled vegetables."

"How did I end up with such a clever disciple?" the old immortal pondered.

"Is it because my master has good taste?"

"That makes sense."

"Master, we need to prepare gifts for this visit, right? When out and about, it's different from being at home; we should still observe some etiquette."

"It’s a scholar; we could simply buy a few books from a roadside stall to satisfy him. It's easy to handle."

"Another scholar? Let’s not get turned away again."

"Mountain Peak, I must reveal some truths. My Dao and reputation do carry some weight outside our mountain."

"Then why did the previous elder seem reluctant to invite us to his abode? Even inviting us for tea would have sufficed. I feel that elder was quite polite, even though he clearly didn’t want to see us; still, he maintained proper decorum. This kind of scenario is familiar to me. When I traveled down from Ground Peak, many wealthy households shrouded in malice would refuse to let me in. After clarifying my intentions, they would merely toss me a handful of copper coins or a few pieces of silver, and I understood their message."

"I see."

"Master, you should spend less time sleeping on the mountain and walk around more. I learned these simple human affairs during my travels."

"Mountain Peak, on your last descent, did you meet an elderly person along the way? I heard you two had a pleasant conversation?"

"Yes, that elder mentioned an acquaintance of yours; while climbing the mountain, I pointed him in the right direction and chatted with him for a moment. He seemed quite happy afterward."

The Fire Dragon Immortal nodded, saying little. 

After all, once a sword immortal leaves Ground Peak, there’s a chance for gossip to spread like wildfire.

When he returns to the Northern Continent, he would pay a visit to that sect and ensure the elder is entertained.

However, the Fire Dragon Immortal felt a tinge of melancholy. Despite his high cultivation, there are still many human separations that bring sorrow.

Not all can return.

A broken sword can be mended, but people may not have that chance.

Beyond the Hanging Mountain, on the Sword Qi Great Wall, the sword qi soared to the skies.

In the righteous realm, roosters crowed, dogs barked, and smoke curled from kitchens as the lights of thousands of homes flickered.

Three continents could lose all of this in an instant.

Finally, Zhang Shanfeng said without reason, "Master, although your Dao is not high, I believe you are the best master in the world."

The old immortal smiled, "That's right. The way both the master and the disciple perceive each other is quite sound."

Zhang Shanfeng casually remarked, "Master, does that mean when I attain your level of Dao, I can consider my cultivation a small success?"

The old immortal laughed heartily, "That's right."

The myriad paths of the Dao originate from one.

After a moment of silence, the old immortal chuckled softly, saying, "Blessings abound, Heaven respects."

---

Earlier, in early summer, at the shop on Dragon Riding Alley, only Shi Rou remained to manage the business.

Pei Qian had already left the school, and Zhu Lian had nodded in agreement, so Shi Rou said nothing further.

Once Pei Qian left, Zhou Mili followed her to the Fallen Mountain.

From being lively, the place suddenly turned quiet, and Shi Rou found it hard to adapt.

Wei Ban often visited Fallen Mountain quietly during this time, while Zheng Dafeng frequently left the luxurious mansion he had built at the mountain foot to come to Zhu Lian's side.

The Lotus Flower Blessed Land had been divided into four, with Fallen Mountain occupying one of the parts.

This was, of course, a good thing, but it brought its own troubles. Every blessed land needed to "spend money" to maintain stability in the world. 

Especially when trying to elevate a low-grade blessed land with scarce spiritual energy to a mid-grade blessed land, it required the land's steward to continually consume celestial coins. In simpler terms, it was an insatiable pit. However, if managed well, it could become like the Yuguizong’s cloud cave blessed land in Tongyezhou, initially allowing the blessed land to consume celestial coins, but eventually upgrading to a high-grade blessed land. This would establish a relatively stable pattern, attracting local deities to help stabilize the spiritual energy of the mountains and waters. Various Daoist sects would also gather around the blessed land, and rather than draining the Jiang family's resources, it would result in a steady influx of wealth that ultimately benefited them.

The local cultivators of the blessed land and the various spiritual treasures nurtured by the spiritual energy would all be sources of wealth.

Recently, Wei Ban, Zhu Lian, and Zheng Dafeng had been discussing how to manage this small patch of land, temporarily named "Lotus Root Blessed Land." The real name would, of course, have to wait until Chen Pingan returned.

Currently, this small blessed land was part of the territory of the former Lotus Flower Blessed Land in the Southern Garden Kingdom.

The total population was around twenty million.

When Fallen Mountain acquired the Lotus Root Blessed Land, it already had a significant amount of spiritual energy, falling between low and mid-grade blessed lands. This meant that the beings within the Southern Garden Kingdom, whether human or spirit, could have a chance to cultivate.

However, the crux of the issue was that unless it became a mid-grade blessed land, even if the emperor of Southern Garden Kingdom sanctioned the local deities, they still couldn’t retain spiritual energy. The spiritual energy of this blessed land would dissipate, vanishing without a trace. Even someone like Wei Ban, a mountain god, couldn’t find any clues about the disappearance of the spiritual energy, let alone prevent its gradual leakage. Therefore, the urgent task was how to pour money into upgrading the Lotus Root Blessed Land to a mid-grade blessed land. Yet, how to spend that money, who to borrow from, and how much to borrow—these were significant questions. Only after addressing these could they discuss signing contracts with the emperor of Southern Garden Kingdom and Zhong Qiu, as well as how to secretly place celestial tools and spread cultivation manuals, among numerous other trivial matters. Then there was the full set of etiquette and protocols for the Southern Garden Kingdom’s sanctioned local deities, as well as how Fallen Mountain could gain benefits from the Lotus Root Blessed Land, ensuring it wouldn’t deplete without return, and allowing a mid-grade blessed land to aim for high-grade status, thus eventually yielding a batch of earthly immortal cultivators that Fallen Mountain could attract.

This also required Fallen Mountain to assume the role of "Heavenly Master," establishing meticulous regulations for the Lotus Root Blessed Land.

Zhu Lian, Zheng Dafeng, and Wei Ban each presented a detailed plan and then checked for any omissions.

Afterward, Zhu Lian, rarely taking the initiative, sent a letter to Lu Baixiang, asking him to gather forces while also starting to accumulate celestial coins.

As for Wei Xian's letter, it only needed to be sent to Cui Dongshan. After all, since he was the disciple of their young master, there was no need for pleasantries.

Zhu Lian couldn’t help cursing when he used the expensive cross-continental flying sword for the letter to Sui You. 

He hoped that Sui You wouldn't waste his cultivation time, and reminded him that he should occasionally send back some magical treasures to his family.

Wei Ban, being pragmatic, willingly communicated and borrowed money from various forces he was familiar with in the Great Li Dynasty. However, the dividends from the Lotus Root Blessed Land after it became a mid-grade blessed land would be necessary, similar to the shared profits from the Niu Jiao Mountain ferry.

Zhu Lian insisted that Wei Ban must present enough Gu Yu coins and could only take one-tenth of the Lotus Root Blessed Land profits, not the two-tenths he originally proposed. Additionally, Zhu Lian wanted to add a time limit of one thousand years; after that, if Wei Ban still wanted to share in the profits, he would have to provide additional Gu Yu coins, with the specific amount to be discussed later.

Zheng Dafeng naturally supported Zhu Lian.

While Wei Ban was secretly borrowing money, he slowly negotiated with these two.

Zheng Dafeng and Zhu Lian had nothing to say about Wei Ban's actions; he would know how to manage things.

When Cui Dongshan received the confidential letter, the three of them had a similar stance: regardless of how much celestial money he was willing to offer, he was absolutely not allowed to interfere with the profit-sharing agreement. Even if Cui Dongshan approached Fallen Mountain under the guise of borrowing money, it was acceptable.

The three of them met again at Zhu Lian's courtyard. Wei Ban sighed, slowly stating, "The calculations are in; we need to spend at least two thousand Gu Yu coins and at most three thousand to barely upgrade to a mid-grade blessed land. The longer we delay, the greater the expense."

Zhu Lian remarked, "We haven't received replies from the Fan and Sun families in Lao Longcheng yet."

According to their discussions, if these two families were willing to lend money to Fallen Mountain, it would be best to include interest, and Fallen Mountain would repay them as agreed. However, if both families were willing to invest a substantial amount of Gu Yu coins, they could jointly share one-tenth of the blessed land’s profits or Fallen Mountain could repay half the profits along with half the principal without interest over time. Nonetheless, they were prepared for the worst-case scenario: that both families might refuse to lend, feeling that the profits were too small or the returns too slow.

Ruan Qiong had returned from a new mountain in the Great Li Dynasty to Longquan County. However, when it came to the neighboring Longquan Sword Sect, none of the three even considered asking for help, as both sides were not well-suited to deepen their ties. After all, Chen Pingan was the true master of Fallen Mountain, and all schemes had to prioritize his circumstances.

Zheng Dafeng laughed, "Why not have Wei Ban host another night banquet? Even a mosquito's leg is meat. After a few days, once he reaches the Jade Purity level, he can hold another one, and that would be two mosquito legs."

Wei Ban sighed, "That's a bit shameless, don’t you think?"

Zheng Dafeng turned to Zhu Lian and asked, "Do you think it's appropriate?"

Zhu Lian replied seriously, "I think it's quite appropriate."

Wei Ban chuckled, "Fine, then I'll host another one and gather more celestial coins and various spiritual tools."

Zheng Dafeng said, "But if Niu Jiao Mountain reopens its shop, selling those not-so-fresh mountain-climbing gifts at a high price, that would indeed be shameless."

Zhu Lian laughed, "I’ll sell them and act as the shopkeeper. There's no need for Wei Shan God to show up; what’s there to worry about? At most, I’ll let Piyun Mountain release a rumor that Wei Shan God’s family was robbed clean."

Wei Ban rubbed his forehead, "Let’s open the shop before the night banquet is held. Since we’ve already lost our sense of shame, we might as well let them know I’m currently short on money."

Zheng Dafeng clicked his tongue, "That's killing two birds with one stone, making people mistakenly think you need celestial coins to increase your chances of breaking through. The second night banquet would hold significant meaning; the mountain-climbing gifts might not be any worse than the first."

Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafeng exchanged knowing smiles.

Then the three of them began to discuss the details of how to elevate the blessed land to mid-grade.

After Zhu Lian had entered the Lotus Root Blessed Land in Southern Garden Kingdom with Pei Qian, he made another visit alone. The opening and closing of this blessed land were not trivial matters; the loss of spiritual energy could be significant, easily injuring the Lotus Root Blessed Land's core. Therefore, each time they entered a new blessed land, they needed to be extremely cautious. Zhu Lian approached the national teacher Zhong Qiu and, through Zhong Qiu’s introduction, met the emperor of Southern Garden Kingdom. The conversation was neither pleasant nor overly stiff. Eventually, Zhong Qiu said something pivotal, seemingly asking Zhu Lian if he was the rumored nobleman Zhu Lian. Zhu Lian neither confirmed nor denied, and the emperor’s expression shifted, losing some of its previous hesitance.

Zhu Lian was now the "fallen immortal," and the emperor of Southern Garden Kingdom undoubtedly had reservations about him.

However, if this "fallen immortal" were indeed Zhu Lian, the emperor would only be left with fear.

It was simple: historically, which martial lunatic killed nine people, nearly wiping out the remaining nine grandmasters, right in the capital of Southern Garden Kingdom?

Who wouldn’t be afraid of negotiating business with such a person?

In the end, Zhu Lian casually mentioned to that emperor that there existed superior methods of longevity outside their Lotus Flower Blessed Land. Many emperors who practiced alchemy and cultivation had perished simply due to following the wrong methods.

The emperor's eyes then shifted from fear to fervor.

Although the national teacher Zhong Qiu was worried, he said nothing further.

Having discussed the major issue among the three in the small courtyard, they moved on to another significant matter.

Pei Qian's martial training.

Crying and howling filled the second floor almost every day.

Wei Ban was somewhat worried that Pei Qian's character would change drastically, and when Chen Pingan returned to Fallen Mountain, who would bear the responsibility?

Zheng Dafeng stated that he was merely the gatekeeper at the mountain foot. Ultimately, it was Zhu Lian, the great steward, who was responsible. Zhu Lian claimed he couldn't handle it and suggested letting the senior elder from the bamboo tower, Cui Cheng, take over. Wei Ban was left speechless.

After much hesitation, Wei Ban finally said, "If Chen Pingan truly gets angry, I’ll just hide in Piyun Mountain. Where will you two run to?"

Zheng Dafeng looked at Zhu Lian, "At least I’ll be a bit further from the bamboo tower."

Zhu Lian smiled and said, "It’s alright; there won’t be any major issues. If something does happen, it is something beyond anyone’s control. Perhaps if my young master were here, it would be better, but since he isn’t, and things happen that cannot be avoided, we can only observe the situation."

Wei Ban felt a headache coming on and left.

Zheng Dafeng thought for a moment, then descended the mountain, heading to a small town.

He visited Yang's shop, not to borrow money but to inquire about some operational details for the blessed land.

The old man, puffing clouds and exhaling mist, didn’t provide any answers for those trivial matters but instead mocked, "You really consider Fallen Mountain your home, don’t you?"

The hunchbacked man smiled, "I think it’s quite good."

Old Yang replied, "For these small matters, you can send a letter to Shizifeng in North Ju Lu Continent; Li Liu will tell you."

Zheng Dafeng nodded.

Zheng Dafeng asked, "Can I use the Jin Liang True Qi talisman on someone else?"

Old Yang replied, "Do as you wish."

Zheng Dafeng then stood up to leave.

In the front shop, the hunchbacked man leaned on the counter, joking with his junior sister, which made the junior disciple feel so stifled he wanted to hit someone.

Meanwhile, at Fallen Mountain, in the early dawn, the girl who should have gone to the second floor was rushing down to the foot of the mountain, sitting on the steps and secretly wiping her tears.

Once she took another step, it would mean leaving Fallen Mountain.

So she sat there in a daze.

And she knew that if she went late to the bamboo tower, she would only suffer more.

When she finally stood up slowly, ready to ascend the mountain, she discovered the old cook sitting on the steps behind her.

Pei Qian, holding her walking staff, angrily exclaimed, "Old cook, are you afraid I’ll sneak back to the shop in Dragon Riding Alley?! Am I that cowardly?"

Zhu Lian shook his head, "I don’t think there's anything wrong with you returning to Dragon Riding Alley."

Pei Qian plopped back down, placing her staff horizontally, crossing her arms in anger.

Zhu Lian, sitting on the steps behind, smiled and said, "If you’re worried about disappointing the young master, there’s no need. Your master won't abandon you or be disappointed just because you’ve only practiced half the boxing technique. Don’t worry; I won’t deceive you. Only if you slack off and delay your studies will he be disappointed."

Tears immediately welled up in Pei Qian's eyes.

Every time she woke up from the drugged state after being carried away by Chen Ruchu from the bamboo tower, she was determined to copy her lessons. Yet, her spirit trembled, and her body shook; how could she avoid trembling hands?

Despite all her efforts to persist, using various methods like tying her hands to the pen, she still couldn't write a single word properly and had accumulated a significant amount of debts.

Zhu Lian continued speaking to that delicate figure, "But slacking off can be of two kinds; mental laxity is more frightening. If you can practice boxing while catching up on your debts someday, that won’t be true laziness. Your master would actually think you did well because he believes everyone can have their shortcomings, and temporary inability doesn’t count as a fault. When you have the strength and will, being able to make up for it is even more rare."

Pei Qian wiped her face and silently stood up, racing up the mountain.

Zhu Lian remained seated, turning his gaze.

One day, while Zhu Lian was in the kitchen sautéing dishes with unusual care, he prepared quite a few seasonal dishes.

Because at the door stood a frail girl with arms drooping and a pale face, who had wandered over, saying she felt a bit peckish today.

Thus, Zhu Lian planned to treat this little girl well.

Then, Ceng Yuanji mentioned that a visitor had come to Fallen Mountain from Lao Longcheng, claiming to be Sun Jianshu.

Zhu Lian, with an apron tied around him, responded with an "Oh," saying to let that Sun family head wait for a moment. If necessary, he could call out Wei Ban’s name to ensure this fellow entertained the guest first.

Pei Qian said, "Old cook, go handle the important matters. You’ve already cooked several dishes; it’s enough to eat. Later, I’ll have Mili bring them to the table."

In the yard, the little water spirit helping Pei Qian carry her staff straightened up, declaring loudly, "Acting as the right protector of the Dragon Riding Alley’s New Year shop, Zhou Mili, at your service!"

Pei Qian affirmed with an "Mm," turning to say, "If you can get the job done well, when my master returns, I can speak well of you to him, and you might have a chance to be promoted to the right protector of Fallen Mountain."

Zhou Mili straightened her back and smiled broadly, but quickly closed her mouth.

In the kitchen, Zhu Lian did not turn his head, "I think what I’m currently busy with is the important matter."

Pei Qian hesitated for a moment, "Old cook, you should go meet that guest; if you cook so many dishes, what will you do with the leftovers?"

The little water spirit, who was about to say something profound, was met with Pei Qian’s glare, causing her to exclaim loudly, "I’m not hungry today!"

Zhu Lian finally put down the spatula, untied the apron, and left the kitchen and yard.

In the main room, Pei Qian instructed Zhou Mili to bring the dishes to the main table, but what puzzled Zhou Mili was that Pei Qian also ordered her to set an extra pair of chopsticks on the main seat facing the door.

Zhou Mili took a large bowl, filled it with rice, and sat on a bench with Pei Qian. Since Zhou Mili needed to help Pei Qian pick up vegetables and feed her, it had become quite common lately. Pei Qian assured her that all these contributions would be recorded in her merit book, and when her master returned, it would be time for rewards.

Every bite of food Zhou Mili fed Pei Qian was followed by her ravenously devouring her own meal. When she looked up, she saw Pei Qian gazing at the empty seat that was silently set with rice and chopsticks, and then Pei Qian withdrew her gaze, appearing somewhat delighted as she swayed her head and shoulders. She told Zhou Mili to refill her bowl, stating she needed to eat more today; if she filled up now, she could practice a few more punches tomorrow.

After Zhou Mili stood up, she scurried over to fill her bowl with rice from the food barrel.

With her back to Pei Qian, the little water spirit stealthily wiped her face and sniffed. She wasn’t truly foolish; she knew that every bite Pei Qian took now came with pain.

This day was the fifth of May.

For cultivators, it was a favorable time to ascend to famous mountains.

Chen Pingan encountered a scholar and his servant in the deep mountains of the Fuhua Kingdom. They were two ordinary individuals—the scholar had failed the imperial examination and, having read some strange tales, believed that those who achieved enlightenment had vanished into the hidden mountains and forests. He was determined to find one or two to learn some immortal techniques, thinking that it would be easier than achieving success through the exam.

Thus, they endured much hardship in search of ancient temples and old sages, and when Chen Pingan came across them on a mountain path, the young scholar and servant were already haggard and starving. Under the scorching sun, the young servant was trying to catch fish in a stream while the scholar lounged in the shade, occasionally asking if he had caught anything. The young servant was extremely dejected, saying he hadn’t caught a thing. Chen Pingan, perched on the branch of an ancient pine tree, closed his eyes to rest while practicing his sword stance and breathing techniques.

Finally, the young servant managed to catch a spiny fish and, overjoyed, held it high to boast to his master. But suddenly, the fish jabbed him with its spikes, slipping from his hands. The young scholar, intending to fan the big fish with a wild banana leaf, saw the young servant plop back down in the stream, wailing. The young scholar sighed, trying to console him, but the young servant cried even louder, aggravating the scholar’s worry as he scratched his head by the stream.

Chen Pingan took out the bamboo box he carried and held a fresh green bamboo walking stick, gracefully walking down the mountain path. "By chance," he encountered the scholar and servant, rolled up his pant legs and sleeves, and without further ado, stepped into the stream. He carefully selected a spot where fish were abundant and began moving stones to build a dam near the bank. After establishing the structure, he started catching fish in the shallow water, quickly pulling several spiny fish and other small fish to the shore. The young servant’s eyes sparkled, feeling that according to his master’s explanation, in the martial world, this was equivalent to receiving guidance from a powerful expert, as if an immortal were bestowing longevity techniques upon him on the mountain!

The young servant completely forgot about the pain in his hands and, following suit, began to gather stones and scoop water, eventually catching some small stream fish, which, though not comparable to the "expert," would suffice for a meal.

Yet, upon realizing they had exhausted their supply of fire starters, they worried about how to cook the fish. The scholar and servant exchanged helpless glances, as they had not seen smoke rising from a kitchen for a long time. At the journey's beginning, they had found the crowing roosters and barking dogs of village life annoying, but now they found themselves yearning for those sounds.

Fortunately, the seemingly harmless young man in the green shirt taught the servant a trick. He picked some dogtail grass, strung the cleaned fish onto it, and laid them on a hot stone by the stream to dry. The young servant thought nothing of it and applied what he had learned, placing the larger fish, about the size of a palm, and smaller fish, barely the length of a finger, onto the steaming rocks.

The scholar introduced himself, "I am Lu Dun from Dujiao County in Fuhua Kingdom," inviting the young traveler to enjoy the shade under the trees. The servant crouched nearby, watching the ten or so fish lying on the rock, feeling secretly pleased. The young man introduced himself as Chen, from a small southern country, traveling through this area.

Lu Dun chatted with him, primarily hoping to travel together to his hometown in Dujiao County. Otherwise, he would be quite embarrassed, as he still had five or six hundred miles to go. In truth, along the way, there were two families of local prominence that had connections with his family, from whom he could borrow some money. However, he couldn’t bring himself to ask, particularly since one of those families had a peer who had gained a significant reputation in this year’s imperial examination; he felt it was inappropriate to visit like a beggar. As for the other family, there was a lovely maiden he admired, refined and gentle, renowned for her beauty, and he felt he had no face to go there.

Chen Pingan took out some dry rations from his bamboo box and offered them to the duo.

The young scholar thanked him, not holding back, and then shared half with the servant.

The three shared the rations.

Chen Pingan informed them that the dried fish could be eaten directly and were quite filling.

The scholar and servant were enlightened.

The young scholar, being well-read, mentioned that he had seen a similar account in "Miscellaneous Records of the Western Frontier," stating that the blazing sun was fearsome; if one pressed dough on a clay wall, it would bake in no time.

The young servant felt quite proud.

His master was indeed knowledgeable.

Chen Pingan patiently listened to the young scholar’s elaboration while chewing thoughtfully.

He had purchased a set of twenty-four seasonal Gu Yu posts from the Dragon Head Ferry in the Green Oriole Country. The quantity was substantial but not expensive—twelve snowflake coins. The expensive item was the Gu Yu plaque, priced at forty-eight snowflake coins. To bargain for two coins at that time, Chen Pingan had to exert much effort.

In Jingnan Country, where cricket fighting had become a trend, he bought three bamboo cricket cages to give to Pei Qian and Zhou Mili, of course not forgetting the young girl in the pink skirt, Chen Ruchu.

He also picked up three small porcelain pots from Lan Fang Country to plant small green pines and orchids. The pots from Lan Fang Country were unmatched among the territories of a dozen countries, and all three of them received one. However, even if they planted flowers and plants, Pei Qian and Zhou Mili would likely leave the care to Chen Ruchu, quickly losing patience with daily watering and moving them in and out.

From the Golden Door Country, he acquired a pre-imperial incense burner and a set of intricately designed hollow golden spheres, with nine pieces in total, fitting together from large to small.

In the end, Chen Pingan did not agree to travel with the scholar and servant.

However, he ultimately gifted them the stream fish he had caught, along with some fishing hooks and lines. After expressing their gratitude once more, they continued on their way.

Chen Pingan sat by the stream in the mountain, beginning to practice breathing techniques.

After so many years of wandering, Chen Pingan had encountered many people and admired many. Yet, there was one person who, during the most arduous journey on Shujian Lake, seemed inconspicuous, merely a passerby along a muddy road, yet left a lasting impression on Chen Pingan.

That was a poor old woman from the countryside. At that time, Chen Pingan had been repaying debts along with Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi.

As they approached the village stream, Chen Pingan saw the bent figure of a destitute old woman, her clothes clean, though patched and worn, still possessing a hint of dignity.

She had just returned from washing clothes by the stream, carrying a large bamboo basket, when she encountered the ghost of her grandson who had died, now attached to Zeng Ye’s body, bowing before her earnestly.

The old woman quickly placed down the bamboo basket filled with clean clothes on the muddy ground and crouched down, attempting to help the unfamiliar boy to his feet.

That scene would forever be etched in Chen Pingan's memory.

It could even be said that, in the pitch-black depths of Shujian Lake, she was a tiny yet warm light.

From the old woman, Chen Pingan first clearly felt the power of two words.

Calmness.

As if all the invisible rules and hardships of the world had settled upon her, yet they seemed so trivial.

In this world, there are distinctions between the mountains and the valleys, as well as between wealth and poverty, yet the weight of suffering does not necessarily vary in size. What burdens one person’s heart might be akin to another person enduring a stab of pain; it’s challenging to articulate in terms of the Dao—suffering is always universal.

Only the word calmness remains unchanged through the ages.

Suddenly, Chen Pingan opened his eyes, as if he had been forcibly ejected from the introspective techniques of a cultivator, his spirit agitated!

Yet it was far from the chaotic state of a warrior gone mad.

He felt his sleeves swell, unable to contain the surging intent of his fists.

Both his dantian points resonated like drums being struck, vibrating intensely.

He stood up, staggering, and stepped into the stream, gritting his teeth to stabilize himself, one foot on the mountain, the other in the water.

As the drums echoed, the fire dragon of qi flowed through his internal channels, producing a series of thunderous vibrations that naturally erupted within his small world.

As the drums fell silent, Chen Pingan felt a hero's courage ignite within him.

**(End of Chapter)**

 **Chapter 623: The Present and Future of Baoping Continent**

The long-vanished sage Ruan Qiong finally returned home after a long absence. He first visited a shop by the Longxu River and met with his disciple Xu Xiaoqiao. Before heading to the main peak of Longquan Sword Sect at Shenshou Mountain, he casually tossed out two unruly creatures that had taken residence in the western mountain's affiliated estate. Only after that did Ruan Qiong return to his own mountain.

The twelve disciples he had accepted after Dong Gu and Xu Xiaoqiao were gathered by his second senior brother, Dong Gu, who had them each demonstrate their swordsmanship. Ruan Qiong maintained an expressionless demeanor throughout, offering no guidance on their specific sword techniques. After watching them, he simply got up and went to forge swords, leaving the originally spirited disciples feeling increasingly anxious.

The senior sister, who favored wearing blue robes, had not shown herself at all.

Fourth senior brother Xie Ling was present, sighed, and then returned to his dwelling to continue his cultivation.

Once Ruan Qiong made his appearance, people flocked to Longquan Sword Sect, hoping to catch the eye of this sect's renowned sage. Among them were young disciples escorted by the powerful families of the Great Li Dynasty, as well as teenagers who had come alone, and many hopefuls looking to be honored as guest disciples from the mountains.

The crowd was a chaotic mix.

This situation left Dong Gu, Ruan Qiong's nominal eldest disciple, feeling somewhat exasperated. He not only had to serve as a mentor to the twelve younger disciples who were not yet recorded in the ancestral hall's roster but also manage all sorts of matters within the sect. Furthermore, the twelve had already been training at Longquan Sword Sect for some time; their talents and aptitudes were roughly known to each other, revealing aspects of their personalities. Some were distracted by social interactions, believing their swordsmanship was inferior, while others were struggling to find the right methods to improve, making slow progress. There were those who behaved humbly on the mountain but took pride in their status as disciples when they descended; then there was the remarkable innate sword cultivator, who had privately requested to learn more advanced sword techniques from Dong Gu.

As for the sects that had built estates in the western mountains, they frequently visited Shenshou Mountain, and it naturally fell upon Dong Gu to manage these relationships—a task that was quite exhausting and time-consuming. Senior sister Ruan Xiu would certainly not bother with such matters, and junior sister Xu Xiaoqiao was indifferent by nature, disliking socializing. Xie Ling had no desire to flatter or engage in pleasantries either.

If it weren’t for the fact that Longquan Sword Sect didn’t have to worry about financial burdens, Dong Gu would have wanted to backtrack on his initial offer to his master Ruan Qiong regarding opening a peak, thus allowing him to retreat into seclusion for cultivation. He had set a rule for himself to achieve the Golden Core stage within a hundred years. After all, unlike junior sister Xu Xiaoqiao, who was a sword cultivator from the Wind and Snow Temple, Dong Gu, although the first disciple recorded in the Longquan Sword Sect’s lineage, was not a sword cultivator himself—this was actually quite a deviation from the norm.

While Ruan Qiong didn’t mind, Dong Gu felt extremely guilty about it. Thus, he thought of the simplest solution: if he wasn’t a sword cultivator, he would compensate with his cultivation level.

As for junior brother Xie Ling, he had already nurtured a personal flying sword and was currently in the process of refining it. Moreover, the ancestor of the Xie family, who had previously demonstrated the might to suppress an entire continent, Xie Shi, had presented two significant treasures to Xie Ling: one was the relic of a sword immortal from North Ju Province named “Peach Leaf,” which could be refined into his personal flying sword. Although it wouldn’t be considered Xie Ling’s true personal sword, its power would be immense once refined. The other was a high-quality sword nurturing gourd named “Full Moon.”

Dong Gu was well aware that in junior brother Xie Ling’s eyes, he was hardly regarded as a senior brother. This wasn’t because Xie Ling was arrogant due to his family background; on the contrary, he showed nothing but respect. Whenever he could assist Dong Gu, he never hesitated. During the crucial periods of Dong Gu's advancement into the Golden Core realm, Xie Ling would proactively teach him sword techniques, leaving no room for criticism.

However, Xie Ling’s innate talent and opportunities were simply too good. On the mountain, he only had eyes for Ruan Xiu, and off the mountain, he was focused on a select few young talents, including Ma Kuxuan.

At Dong Gu and Xie Ling’s level, their meals were no longer simple grains, but rather meticulously prepared according to recipes from various schools of thought, which could be quite costly. 

Fortunately, the Longquan Sword Sect was wealthy and had few disciples. Ruan Qiong, being the foremost offering to the Great Li Dynasty, received a substantial annual salary from the court. As for Dong Gu, having walked through Shujian Lake in his early years without taking much action, he had earned considerable merit and was rewarded with a “Peace and Safety” plaque issued by the Ministry of Justice, giving him a respectable official income.

One day, Ruan Qiong left the sword furnace and personally prepared a banquet, specifically inviting Dong Gu.

Upon seeing the common dishes laid out, Dong Gu immediately guessed senior sister would show up. Sure enough, Ruan Xiu soon entered the room, serving herself rice and sitting next to her father Ruan Qiong, while Dong Gu sat facing them with his back to the door.

“Eat slowly, no one’s going to snatch it from you,” Ruan Qiong said naturally, adding a piece of braised pork to his daughter’s bowl before turning to Dong Gu. “I heard the former county magistrate, Wu Yuan, has been reassigned from Xinzhao?”

Dong Gu put down his chopsticks and respectfully replied, “After Longquan County was elevated to Longzhou, this disciple of the national teacher did not follow the usual path to become the Longzhou governor but was instead transferred south of Guanhushu Academy, continuing to serve as a local county magistrate near the foot of the new Mount Zhongyue of the Great Li Dynasty.”

It was speculated that Wu Yuan, who had once been entrusted with great expectations by the national teacher, was sent to expand the territory, only to be pushed around and humiliated by the local families and clans. Although he later advanced from county magistrate to county governor, the national teacher had long harbored discontent. Therefore, this elevation was merely a superficial promotion, effectively a demotion to a foreign land.

Longquan County had expanded into Longzhou, covering vast territories and including Qingci, Baoxi, Sanjiang, and Xianghu counties. The small town still belonged to Huaihuang County.

The current county magistrate Yuan had ascended to governor of Qingci County, while the supervisor of the Long Kiln remained in their original position, although the rank of the supervisor was quietly adjusted to be equivalent to that of a local county governor. Thus, both young talents from the prominent families of the two major surnames had actually been promoted—one openly, the other less conspicuously.

The governor of Longzhou was an outsider to the Great Li court, originating from the vassal Huangting Kingdom. Named Wei Li, he came from a humble background and held only a minor position as a county governor there, yet upon arriving in Great Li, he became a significant local official, which surprised the court. Rumors circulated in the capital that he had been personally chosen by the Minister of Personnel, so there was no contention over his appointment. Such a preferential promotion for a vassal official to a high-ranking local position was unprecedented. After all, the emperor did not voice objections, nor did the Ministry of Rites stir any trouble; who would dare to act recklessly? Few officials could stand their ground against the national teacher Cui.

Besides the changes in the bureaucracy, the three city gods of the counties also had their assignments settled. The city gods for both the county and city were local spirits nominated by the two neighboring states. Although they had long been recorded in the Ministry of Rites as potential candidates for various local deities, they typically wouldn’t receive significant positions. This time, unexpectedly earning the role of Longzhou’s city god was indeed a coveted position.

As for the first city god of Longzhou, the announcement of this appointment caused quite a stir in the Great Li court, where many high-ranking officials were watching the jokes of the two prominent surnames, Yuan and Cao.

Because the city god was not a candidate nominated by those two families but rather a local deity from a small shrine at Mantou Mountain, located where the two rivers converge.

Ruan Qiong slowly remarked, “Wu Yuan’s departure from the Great Li heartland may not be a bad thing.”

Dong Gu, not being privy to the internal workings of the Great Li court, dared not speculate further.

However, Dong Gu felt a sense of regret regarding Wu Yuan’s departure, as this young governor had been quite adept at dealing with matters and had earned Dong Gu’s admiration in their interactions.

Fortunately, the new governor of Baoxi County, named Fu Yu, was someone who had entered the local county office early on with Wu Yuan. Originally a secretary, many of his colleagues were surprised to discover that this governor Fu actually came from the prestigious Fu family, one of the prominent families outside the top two surnames.

After Fu Yu’s promotion to the governorship, he quickly visited Longquan Sword Sect, and Dong Gu had a pleasant conversation with him, marking a noteworthy development.

Ruan Qiong said, “From now on, you need not concern yourself with the comings and goings on the mountain. If you keep adopting such responsibilities, you’ll never find time to cultivate. The foundation of Longquan Sword Sect lies not in socializing.”

Ruan Qiong glanced at Dong Gu, who was somewhat apprehensive, likely misinterpreting his master’s expression as discontent.

Ruan Qiong rarely wore a smile. “I took you on as a disciple, not to have you run errands. Cultivation is divided between the mountain and the outside world. You’re currently a half-official. Whenever you encounter minor hurdles on the mountain, instead of lingering here, take this opportunity to venture out and gain experience. Regularly correspond with the Ministry of Justice. Given the current chaos in Baoping Continent, you might bring back a few disciples after your trip down the mountain. Next time, arrange with the Ministry of Justice to take a trip to the Ganzu Mountain region. Regardless, you still need to build connections with the Wind and Snow Temple.”

Dong Gu felt a weight lift off his shoulders and nodded.

He was filled with gratitude towards his master. His master’s few words relieved his pressure, imparted deep meaning, and most importantly, indirectly granted him the recognition of the sword cultivators from the Wind and Snow Temple.

Suddenly, Ruan Qiong picked up his chopsticks and swatted away his daughter’s attempt to reach for the last piece of braised pork. “Leave some for Dong Gu.”

At this point, Ruan Xiu had already served herself several bowls of rice.

Dong Gu did not dare to smile.

Ruan Qiong turned to Dong Gu. “What do you think of those twelve disciples?”

Dong Gu began to describe each of their talents and dispositions.

Ruan Qiong looked at his daughter.

Ruan Xiu had just picked up a large piece of vegetables and, with a slight shake, ended up taking less.

Seeing that the dish was nearly empty, Ruan Qiong simply pushed the dish toward her.

Ruan Xiu smiled and asked, “Father, why aren’t we having wine today?”

Ruan Qiong shook his head and suddenly said, “You’ll be going to Longji Mountain to practice in the future. Just remember not to get into conflicts with the sword cultivators from Zhenwu Mountain. Also, no matter what strange occurrences you encounter, don’t be surprised; I’m aware of everything.”

Ruan Xiu nodded.

Ruan Qiong then inquired about the recent happenings in the Great Li Dynasty.

Longquan Sword Sect had the most detailed records of the mountains and rivers in Baoping Continent, compiled personally by the Great Li court and regularly sent to Longquan County and Shenshou Mountain.

Out of the blue, Ruan Qiong said, “Actually, the disciple I wanted to take in back then was Liu Xianyang.”

Dong Gu had heard of this person.

He was the closest friend of Chen Pingan from the Niping Lane, who had nearly perished at the hands of the moving mountain elder from Zhengyang Mountain.

As a result, Liu Xianyang and Chen Pingan had established a deadly rivalry with Zhengyang Mountain and the Xu family of Qingfeng City.

Initially, the Xu family had sold their already built immortal estate at a bargain to the Great Li court, which was not without its apprehension towards Chen Pingan. Later, the Xu family of Qingfeng City made some late-stage efforts to remedy the situation by marrying off a legitimate daughter to a junior member of the Yuan family, and even assisted the Yuan family’s offspring in gaining control of a border cavalry unit.

After all, no one could have anticipated that the boy from Niping Lane would achieve such heights.

Ruan Qiong and Dong Gu merely symbolically ate a few bites of the meal.

Then the master and disciple began to walk around.

Dong Gu quietly said, “The Mountain God of Weishan has hosted another night feast, and the shop left behind by the Baozang Zhai at the Niujiao Mountain ferry has reopened, selling offerings from mountain spirits and various cultivators.”

Ruan Qiong laughed. “It seems Luopo Mountain is in dire need of funds.”

Compared to the Golden Core stage Dong Gu, Ruan Qiong was not only at the Jade Pure stage but also a sage in charge, allowing him to see things from a broader perspective. Wei Po's recent breakthrough was of the kind that faced no bottlenecks. To put it accurately, the bottleneck for Wei Po advancing to the upper five realms had long been broken and done so very subtly. It was only after Ruan Qiong’s long observation that he reached this conclusion. Wei Po sought to achieve the flawless Jade Pure stage rather than merely break through.

Thus, the bamboo blade strike he executed on Qizun Mountain was indeed precise.

Ruan Qiong felt a pang of melancholy.

In the general sense, the great sword immortals—regardless of their sword skills or the depth of their sword intent—could still be observed with a rough estimate of the differences in ability when compared to the upper five realm sword cultivators whose realms were slightly lower. However, some individuals’ sword strikes truly required many years to appreciate their force.

The strength was immense yet unassuming.

Ultimately, it seemed that a sword must fall upon the hearts of people to reveal its true power.

Ruan Qiong hoped that one day Longquan Sword Sect could produce such a sword cultivator, even if it was a bit later.

Dong Gu quickly took his leave.

Ruan Qiong gazed into the distance.

In the North Yue territory, the place where the Great Li Dynasty rose, Wei Po, the Mountain God of North Yue, was the only mountain spirit in Baoping Continent that could rival him—she resided in the South Yue territory and was a female mountain deity.

Currently, the Great Li North Yue was the old North Yue of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, and it still had its mountain god, which could be considered a blessing in disguise, becoming the new North Yue of Baoping Continent.

The wandering swordsman from the Mo family, Xie Ruo, still occupied the mountain peak, neighboring that mountain deity.

Ruan Qiong’s focus was on the new West Yue, Ganzu Mountain. Given its proximity to the Wind and Snow Temple and that Ganzu Mountain had never belonged to any kingdom, Ruan Qiong’s trip was likely to be the easiest. Hence, this master blacksmith of Baoping Continent also conveniently visited the Wind and Snow Temple to catch up with seniors and fellow disciples, which essentially served as a favor from the new emperor of Great Li to Longquan Sword Sect.

In contrast to the undercurrents and murderous intentions brewing at Xie Ruo’s side, Ruan Qiong felt lighthearted and untroubled. Meanwhile, on the other side, in the new East Yue, Qishi Mountain was engulfed in chaos. Almost all first-rate offerings of the Great Li were at the Golden Core and Nascent Soul levels, and during the grand ceremony to confer the mountain gods, a brutal battle occurred. Cultivators from all nations swarmed in, attempting to storm the mountain and slay the Great Li envoy. In the end, the new emperor’s decree, which included the “golden mud and silver rope, to seal the edicts,” was almost destroyed by a hostile Nascent Soul cultivator, sending back those who attacked, but the losses among the Great Li offerings were severe.

Subsequently, the Deputy Minister of Rites from the Great Li, on a heavenly inspection tour, orchestrated another trap, still involving many cultivators from the various destroyed nations, willingly rushing to their deaths. This led to the spiritual energy around Qishi Mountain becoming chaotic. There were sporadic uprisings thereafter, yet Qishi Mountain finally became the new East Yue of Great Li, with its resident deity being one of the old five mountains of the Great Li.

Even more significant than the conferral of the five mountains, the Great Li court had already begun selecting a site in the southern part of Baoping Continent to construct a secondary capital.

Song Jixin was conferred a princely title in the old Long City. Once the secondary capital was completed, he would be referred to as Song Mu in the genealogical records of the royal family and would have authority over the secondary capital from afar.

One of the potential sites was the old capital of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, which, while advantageous in that it wouldn’t deplete too much national strength, had the disadvantage of being too close to Guanhushu Academy. As for the more discreet concerns of the court, certain individuals were wary of the new princely king Song Mu leveraging the connection between the secondary capital and the old Long City to seize control of half of Baoping Continent in one fell swoop.

However, the final location had yet to be determined by the Great Li court.

As the foremost offering of the Great Li, Ruan Qiong was permitted to offer suggestions, and the new emperor of the Great Li would certainly listen to opinions, but Ruan Qiong chose to remain silent.

Ruan Xiu appeared beside Ruan Qiong.

After this trip to the Wind and Snow Temple, Ruan Qiong softly remarked, “When I was young, the elders at the Wind and Snow Temple believed the world wouldn’t change much, and all we needed was to cultivate earnestly. So we juniors thought the same. Now, all the old ones lament that they can no longer foresee what Baoping Continent will look like in just a few decades. Xiu Xiu, do you think this is a good thing or a bad thing?”

Ruan Xiu pondered for a moment before answering indirectly, “The Longquan Sword Sect lacks a cave dwelling of its own.”

Ruan Qiong’s expression grew serious. Using his sage powers, he separated a small realm. “There are two matters. First, the Dragon Slaying Platform cliff at Longji Mountain was divided into three parts, belonging to our Longquan Sword Sect, Wind and Snow Temple, and Zhenwu Mountain respectively. However, you may not be aware that the section managed and mined by the Wind and Snow Temple has almost become a hollow shell. I’ve been pretending not to see it, so when I visit the elder of Wind and Snow Temple, if I mention this, the elder only needs to say that I don’t need to concern myself with it, which essentially concedes the disappearance of the Dragon Slaying Platform. Therefore, there’s no need for you to mind this when you go there for your cultivation.”

“The second matter is that the cave dwelling you mentioned can actually be traded for at Yang’s shop. There are ready-made options, but the price may be difficult to accept. In fact, the price is negotiable; if it comes to it, we can buy on credit.”

At this point, Ruan Qiong glanced at his daughter, worry etched on his face. “I’d rather not stir up trouble.”

Ultimately, he didn’t want Ruan Xiu to get involved too early.

Everything Ruan Qiong did—leaving the Wind and Snow Temple, sacrificing his cultivation to maintain the position of sage at Lizhu Cave Heaven, then establishing his own sect and being invited by the Great Li Song family to serve as an offering—was all for his daughter.

However, Ruan Xiu said, “Father, it’s fine. You know what kind of temperament Old Yang has, right?”

Ruan Qiong chuckled. “I really don’t know.”

Aside from Qi Jingchun, among the many sages who had once settled in Lizhu Cave Heaven, no one dared claim to understand that old man’s thoughts.

And Ruan Qiong was certainly no exception.

Ruan Xiu gazed toward the small town and pulled out a handkerchief, twisting off a piece of pastry, mumbling, “It’s simple; whoever is purer has a better chance of going higher. Old Yang will put his money on them. I don’t think I’m too bad, so you can give it a try. As for how to price it, why not just tell that old senior that we want the ready-made cave dwelling, regardless of its size, and what Ruan Xiu will need to do later will depend on her mood.”

Ruan Qiong was puzzled. “Can that even work?”

Ruan Xiu squinted and smiled, probably because the pastry tasted good, putting her in a good mood. She clapped her hands and said, “Let’s try it.”

Ruan Qiong hesitated for a moment. “Is it really that simple?”

Ruan Xiu nodded.

Just as she was about to reach out, Ruan Qiong had already used his sage powers to silently appear in the backyard of Yang’s shop.

Ruan Xiu sighed, wishing her father would bring back some pastries.

In less than the time it takes to burn a stick of incense, Ruan Qiong returned with a peculiar expression and looked at his daughter, shaking his head, marveling, “Is it really possible for something so good to just fall from the sky?”

When doing business with Old Yang, one thing was guaranteed—more reliable than any vows from the world’s mountains and rivers was the promise laid out by that old senior; it held true without any doubt.

Ruan Xiu glanced at the sky, thinking how nice it would be if some pastries fell.

———

At the southernmost point of Baoping Continent, Old Long City, after Fu Nanhua married the legitimate daughter of the Jiang family from Yunlin and the city lord faced off against the martial artists from the Nine Realms, the qi practitioners had just managed to catch their breath when an even greater event unfolded.

Song Mu, the younger brother of the current Great Li emperor, had now become the most prominent and influential prince of the Song family, settling his fief in Old Long City. Other sons of the former emperor also received princely titles, but all were lesser titles, departing from Great Li to various destroyed nations to establish their territories; none compared to the alarming prominence of Song Mu, who had a single-character title.

For the free-spirited Old Long City, this should have been a piece of bad news. However, the Fu family and several other notable families seemed to have already established communication with the Great Li court, and instead of any backlash or resistance, they thrived in business north of Old Long City and south of the Zhu Ying Kingdom. Unlike before, when they were distinctly divided, the major families in Old Long City began to collaborate. For instance, the Fan family maintained close ties with the Sun family, no matter who planned to profit; the common thread was that the trade routes of these great families in Old Long City were all facilitated by the Great Li.

As long as they held the “Peace and Safety” plaque, they could seek assistance from all Great Li cavalry and the Song family’s vassals along their routes.

Thus, when the Fu family ceded half of the inner city of Old Long City as Song Mu’s princely residence, no one was surprised.

However, as the pivotal hub of the continent, Old Long City was initially affected to some extent by this development. Many qi practitioners, who had viewed Old Long City as a paradise and a place to indulge, quietly left to observe the situation. Yet, with the attitudes expressed by the Tongye Sect and the Yuguizong from the southern continent, business in Old Long City quickly rebounded, flourishing even more than before. Especially after Song Mu took over Old Long City, there were no changes to the status quo, and many practitioners returned to the city to continue enjoying their lives.

On this day, a young man who had shed his princely robe left the fief with a maid to visit a humble herbal shop in the outer city.

He had no attendants, as none were needed.

The young man had a snake with horns curled up in his sleeve.

Moreover, the head of the Fu family in Old Long City was practically his personal offering.

The herbal shop, which had been closed for several years, had just reopened. The shopkeeper was an old man, and with him was a handsome white-clad youth with a mole on his forehead, accompanied by a seemingly foolish child who was as red-lipped and white-toothed as he was but had a vacant gaze and couldn’t speak—a pity.

Song Jixin walked into the alley, the autumn air refreshing, and beside him, his maid Zhi Gui was growing increasingly radiant.

As the pair stepped over the threshold of the herbal shop, the old shopkeeper, not recognizing the young master in front of him, smiled and asked, “Looking to buy some medicine? Feel free to choose; the prices are all listed.”

Song Jixin frowned slightly, glanced at the old man, and began selecting herbs.

Zhi Gui moved a stool from the herbal shop and sat at the door.

The old man smiled, finding these two little ones quite unreserved.

He was fearless now, daring to walk across the entire Baoping Continent, provided he was alongside that white-clad youth.

This old shopkeeper was none other than the Lu Li Immortal, Chen Xiaoyong, who had failed in his scheming in the Yanzhi County of the Color Garment Kingdom. Not only had he not obtained the heavenly master’s seal from the City God Shen Wen, but he had also nearly lost his life, almost failing to keep the Liuli Lamp. Fortunately, neither the national teacher nor the Green Wave Pavilion held this oversight against him. This was quite normal; the national teacher Cui was a person with aspirations to unify the continent, so how could he care about the gains and losses of a moment or place? However, when that white-clad youth found his hiding place, the Lu Li Immortal was thoroughly tricked, to the point where he had no rebuttal left, having calculated everything down to the last detail. Now he only knew that this “youth” surnamed Cui was the head of all spies and assassins in the southern regions of the Great Li.

Song Jixin felt a ripple in his heart upon hearing that phrase and started to walk toward the backyard of the herbal shop.

Just as he lifted the bamboo curtain, the Lu Li Immortal hurriedly said, “Guest, you can’t go back there.”

Song Jixin smiled and replied, “I am Song Mu.”

The Lu Li Immortal thought for a moment and awkwardly smiled, “Feel free, guest.”

Song Jixin turned to look back at the entrance. “Aren’t you coming?”

Zhi Gui turned her head and smiled, “I’ll pass.”

She feared only three people in her life—one was already dead, another was no longer in this world, and the last of the three was half here, just in the backyard.

Song Jixin proceeded alone to the backyard, walking toward the open main room, his steps slow as he adjusted his clothing before entering.

The reason Song Jixin was able to make it to today was due to the decision made by the person inside that room and his uncle Song Changjing.

As for his mother and his “brother” the emperor, they likely wouldn’t mind if he re-entered and erased his name from the royal genealogy.

Crossing the threshold, the white-clad youth seemed to treat this main hall as a study. An exquisite painting of a snowy night’s journey was spread out on the table, detailed yet infused with a sense of artistic spirit, truly a divine piece. A poorly printed martial arts novel from a private bookshop was also opened, with a bronze beast holding the pages down, covered in many red pen annotations.

Song Jixin made a respectful bow. “Song Mu pays his respects to the national teacher.”

Cui Dongshan was sprawled on the table, his legs twisted lazily, turning to glance at Song Jixin with a smile. “It’s been many years since we last met in this little town.”

Song Jixin bowed deeply and said, “If not for the national teacher’s grace, Song Jixin wouldn’t have had the opportunity to enter the Great Li royal family, let alone become a prince here in Old Long City.”

Cui Dongshan replied, “Back then, you and Zhao Yao both received gifts from Qi Jingchun. As for Zhao Yao, to survive, he made a deal with me, sacrificing the Spring Seal, and the gains and losses from that are still hard to say. As for you, Qi Jingchun left you those books. It’s a pity you’ve been too lazy to look through them. Qi Jingchun left his insights on Confucianism and Legalism within those texts. If you were sincere, you would naturally see them. Qi Jingchun isn’t one to be inflexible; he had high hopes for you. Who else was involved in such dealings of ‘external Confucianism and internal Legalism’? If you gain that knowledge, your uncle and I might give you an extra claw on your robe.”

Song Jixin maintained a calm expression.

Cui Dongshan nodded. “Your temperament is indeed better than Zhao Yao’s; it’s no wonder Zhao Yao admired you for so long. He can’t compare to you in chess either.”

Cui Dongshan pointed to a stool.

Song Jixin sat down on the long bench.

Cui Dongshan remained prone on the table, as if chatting casually, smiling as he said, “Song Yuzhang’s death was really a waste. The former emperor’s method of constructing the corridor bridge was not aboveboard. After all, so many descendants of the Great Li Song family had died. As the supervisor, Song Yuzhang not only failed to cut ties with you in time but treated you as his own illegitimate child. If that’s not seeking death, what else could it be?”

Song Jixin’s cheeks twitched, likely from gritting his teeth.

Cui Dongshan laughed heartily, clicking his tongue. “You, Song Jixin, have grand aspirations regarding the throne, but your perspective is still limited. Yet your heart is narrow, and you still can’t let go of that fallen mountain deity Song Yuzhang.”

Song Jixin clenched his fists, remaining silent.

Cui Dongshan asked with a smile, “Is Ma Kuxuan’s persistent pursuit of your maid troubling you?”

Song Jixin nodded. “I know Zhi Gui has no feelings for him, but it’s still unsettling. So when the time is right for me to deal with Ma Kuxuan, I will personally take care of this scoundrel from Xinghua Lane.”

Cui Dongshan waved his hand, smiling. “Scoundrel? Don’t speak such reckless words. In Ma Kuxuan’s eyes, you, the Great Li Song family’s son, the so-called noble lineage, are but a scoundrel. Besides, the Zhenwu Mountain will definitely protect Ma Kuxuan. Not to mention, Ma Kuxuan’s speed in cultivation is well known across the entire continent. So the situation you mentioned may only worsen as time goes on.”

Song Jixin shook his head. “Excessive brilliance leads to a backlash. Since I am a secular prince and my identity cannot change, I need not engage in a head-on confrontation with him. In the world of killing, aside from fists, there are many other means.”

Ma Kuxuan had killed two Golden Core sword cultivators in the Zhu Ying Dynasty—once through careful planning and deception, and another time in a near-fatal confrontation, using an array of hidden techniques to overpower his opponents.

The innate talents he displayed in both instances had subtly marked him as the most gifted cultivator in Baoping Continent.

Before Ma Kuxuan, only two individuals had received such recognition as the favored children of heaven on that mountain in hundreds of years: Li Tuanjing from Fenglei Garden and Wei Jin from the Wind and Snow Temple.

If it weren’t for the personal troubles Li Tuanjing faced, it was rumored that once he reached the Jade Pure stage, he would have a chance to ascend to the Immortal realm, perhaps even the Ascension realm! At that point, the Shengaos Sect wouldn’t be able to suppress Fenglei Garden, let alone Zhengyang Mountain. Therefore, the entanglements of Li Tuanjing’s past were complex and certainly involved more than just Zhengyang Mountain.

However, these truths had faded into memory following Li Tuanjing’s demise.

As the tides of fortune turned, Zhengyang Mountain, which had long been suppressed by Li Tuanjing’s strength, finally regained its ascendancy, beginning to steadily pressure Fenglei Garden. If it weren’t for the new garden master Huang He entering seclusion, forcing all factions to wait for his emergence, Fenglei Garden, which was barely holding on with only Liu Baqiao left, would have likely been continuously challenged by the old sword cultivators from Zhengyang Mountain, who had pent-up frustrations.

Cui Dongshan lightly tapped his fingers on the table, falling into thought.

Song Jixin remained calm.

He had never felt entitled to stand tall in front of this man simply because he had become a prince of the Great Li. In fact, even if he donned different clothes and sat on the throne, it would be the same.

Cui Dongshan looked out the window and, for no reason, said, “A bird born in a cage thinks that spreading its wings to fly is a disease.”

“When a chicken pecks on the ground and sees a shadow of a hawk or falcon passing overhead, it begins to worry about its grain being stolen.”

Song Jixin carefully pondered the deeper meaning of these two phrases.

Cui Dongshan sighed, “Let’s not engage in pointless discussions. I’ve come this time not just to relax but to discuss an important matter with you. As a prince, you can’t remain cooped up in Old Long City forever. The second grand battle of the Great Li is about to genuinely commence. You need to head to the Zhu Ying Dynasty and personally oversee the construction of the secondary capital, while also establishing good relations with the Mo family. A war sustained through war is meaningless if it only stops at plundering.”

Song Jixin quietly asked, “May I ask, national teacher, what does the second grand battle entail?”

Cui Dongshan chuckled. “Without the ability to repair and rebuild, destruction is self-destructive and not sustainable.”

Song Jixin, intelligent as he was, began to grasp the implications of the national teacher’s words.

Cui Dongshan continued, “The southern advance of the Great Li cavalry shattered all existing rules and dynastic laws. This is merely the battlefield on horseback. The next crucial step is how the Great Li warriors dismount and enforce our laws. Laws are static; they simply lie there. Therefore, the key lies in the people—the morality of the law is half in the documents and half in the individuals. How things are done in the north and the south will serve as a test between you, the prince, and His Majesty the emperor. Don’t underestimate those high-ranking officials, including the elder Gu; they’re all watching you two closely.”

Song Jixin replied solemnly, “Thank you for the national teacher’s guidance.”

Cui Dongshan smiled. “Do you know why the former emperor clearly intended for you to ascend the throne, yet before he died, he entrusted the regency to your uncle? He had to project an image of the throne passing from brother to brother.”

Song Jixin’s expression shifted slightly.

Cui Dongshan smirked, pointing at Song Jixin. “Before it was the former emperor and Prince Song Changjing; now it is the new emperor Song He and Prince Song Mu.”

Song Jixin’s lips moved, his complexion paling.

Cui Dongshan continued, “As for matters concerning the throne, your father has already done enough. As for being a father, I see no fault in that. At least for you, the former emperor truly had good intentions. Deep down, you may resent that empress dowager to some extent, but the new emperor has even more reason to resent the former emperor. Therefore, your grievances regarding Song Yuzhang are somewhat laughable. The absurdity lies not in your emotions; it’s very normal to feel that way. The absurdity is that you fail to understand the rules. Do you really think that it was the Lu family’s remnants who killed Song Yuzhang, or your mother who sent his head in a wooden box to the capital? Or the former emperor? It’s clear it was and wasn’t. Can’t you figure that out? Yet you dare to boast here, relying on the situation to kill someone like Ma Kuxuan, who seems destined for greatness?”

Song Jixin stood up again and bowed deeply. “I’ve learned from the national teacher’s teachings!”

Cui Dongshan shot him a sidelong glance, saying, “The books Qi Jingchun left you, the knowledge he imparted, appears to teach you external Confucianism and internal Legalism. In reality, it’s quite the opposite, but you haven’t had the chance to clarify that.”

Song Jixin retook his seat, remaining silent.

Cui Dongshan waved his hand.

Song Jixin stood up and took his leave.

He walked out of the alley alongside his maid Zhi Gui.

Cui Dongshan sat at the threshold, yawning.

The old shopkeeper, whom he had casually brought along, ran into the courtyard and obsequiously asked, “National teacher, was that really the Great Li prince Song Mu?”

Cui Dongshan replied, “That kid was just fooling you; he was playing with you.”

The Lu Li Immortal looked awkward, unsure whether to believe him.

Cui Dongshan waved his hand, “Continue being your shopkeeper.”

The Lu Li Immortal hurriedly exited the courtyard.

Cui Dongshan shifted positions, lying back on the threshold, using his arms as a pillow.

The events in Yanzhi County were merely a small part of many ongoing plots.

Using the enchanted City God Shen Wen as a thread, he manipulated the Color Garment Kingdom, which was one of the publicly known schemes. His true aim, however, was far more discreet: he sought to use a method that conformed to the rules and the Tao to release that pitiful figure suppressed by the heavenly master’s talismans for a millennium in Baidi City, now called Liu Chicheng. For now, he had to rely on the soul of a scholar. This favor, even if he didn’t want to repay it, would still have to be repaid. As for when this debt of gratitude would be settled, it depended on when Cui Dongshan sought out Liu Chicheng.

In the game of Baoping Continent, there were many such hidden moves.

However, for the two of them, it wasn’t anything extraordinary—it was just normal chess play.

For instance, over in the Qingluan Kingdom, the old fellow had his eyes on Liu Qingfeng, Li Baozhen, and Wei Liang. The actions of these three in a single nation were of profound significance, and their future impacts might surpass even those on Baoping Continent. Yet, the three of them were currently unaware, and it was likely that the first to grasp the meaning would turn out to be Liu Qingfeng, who, despite not being a cultivator, had a keen insight.

In a corner, having done countless trivial things over the past hundred years, Cui Dongshan sometimes asked himself what the significance was. If he merely let things go, and the mountains crumbled and the earth shattered, would that be tantamount to having learned enough lessons? Would the final outcome actually be better?

Cui Dongshan opened his eyes, gazing at the scenery just above his head.

Most people simply went with the flow.

The more astute would navigate through life, seeking shortcuts and convenient methods, aiming for speed to achieve their goals. There’s nothing wrong with this; in fact, achieving that is already quite challenging.

However, as the ancients said, life is like a journey against the current, and I am but a traveler. Hence, another sage remarked that the extraordinary wonders of the world often reside in perilous places, where human footprints are rare. Only those with ambition can take their time to arrive and witness the grandeur.

Cui Dongshan sighed.

In the end, all matters of the world, upon careful examination, seemed to boil down to the words “lack of vigor.”

There was Ma Kuxuan, plucked from the chessboard by Lu Chen and then dropped back down.

There was the martial artist Song Changjing at the tenth realm.

There was the sword immortal Wei Jin from the Wind and Snow Temple.

The young sword cultivator from the Zhu Ying Dynasty, who had benefited from calamity and bore the remnants of his nation’s martial legacy.

Liu Xianyang, who practiced swordsmanship in his dreams after breaking and standing anew.

Gu Can, who remained unchanged yet had become even wiser and more adept at navigating the rules of the world.

The Jianghu overlord Li Liu.

Ruan Xiu.

Huang He from Fenglei Garden.

The hidden piece that the Shengaos Sect carefully nurtured and personally trained by Qi Zhen.

The fortunate Xie Ling.

And many other young people, yet to emerge or whose names were not well-known, all of whom could potentially become the pillars of the future tumultuous tides of Baoping Continent.

Cui Dongshan sat up, dazed for a moment, then returned to lying on the Eight Immortals table.

His gaze shifted to the opened martial arts novel on the table, which he had brought back from the cliff academy of the Great Sui. Whenever he found himself with nothing to do, he would flip through a few pages and jot down annotations.

Currently, he opened to a page where the author wrote, “With sword in hand, clothing swept aside, leaping onto rooftops, the tiles falling silent, the moon shining bright; swift as a flying bird.” He annotated in red, “Truly the grace of a sword immortal.”

Cui Dongshan moved the paperweight aside, spat lightly onto his fingertip, and flicked the page gently, flipping it back again, glancing at his own annotations, and couldn’t help but praise himself, “Good writing, good writing, as expected of a master’s disciple.”

Cui Dongshan raised his head and saw a naive, oblivious child standing by the side of the adjacent room.

Cui Dongshan smiled warmly, crouched down, ruffled the child’s hair, and said kindly, “Little Gao Cheng, you must grow up quickly.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 624: The Foundation of Ruined Peak (Part 1)

Chen Ping'an withdrew his foot from the creek, exhaling a heavy breath of murky air. With a flick of his right wrist, a few specks of ash scattered away.

Previously, when Chen Ping'an's right arm had been restrained by the assassin from the Deer Cutting Mountain using a Buddhist technique, the remnants he felt were the last traces of that entanglement now thoroughly shaken off.

Qi Jinglong, a sword cultivator on the verge of breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, had described the assassination in the valley as "extremely perilous," attributing at least half of that danger to the Buddhist technique employed.

Chen Ping'an crouched down, scooping water with both hands to wash his face. He glanced at his reflection in the water, tilting his head as he rubbed the stubble on his chin with his palm, worried that he might end up looking like Xu Yuanxia, that burly man with a great beard.

He reached into the water, splayed his palm, and pressed down gently. The stream suddenly halted, only to resume flowing as if nothing had happened.

Changing his gesture, he spun his palm in circles, causing the water at his feet to whirl into a larger vortex. However, he quickly stopped the movement, and the creek returned to its calm state.

In the past, when he traveled with Zhang Shanfeng, he had seen that young Taoist frequently gesturing to himself in strange forms, neither quite like fists nor palms. Finding it odd, Chen Ping'an had learned a few superficial stances, but he always felt something was off. It was strange, really; if it came down to martial prowess, a hundred Zhang Shanfengs wouldn't be a match for Chen Ping'an. Moreover, he had always grasped martial arts quickly. Just like back in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, after observing the foundational stances of the Great Dragon Fist, he had been able to replicate them, not just in form but also in spirit. Yet, the martial techniques of Zhang Shanfeng remained elusive to him.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an didn’t dwell too deeply on it, considering Zhang Shanfeng's martial arts to be a unique method cultivated by mountain practitioners that required accompanying incantations.

The most basic martial artists in the Jianghu (Rivers and Lakes) were often mocked as mere "pugilistic amateurs" because they could only perform basic stances without understanding the true essence. Ultimately, what mattered was the pure flow of genuine energy (Qi) within one's body. Deeper still lay the realm of divine intent, a profound state of understanding. Even within the same style of martial arts, the intent could vary greatly, and even with the same master and textbook, disciples could present entirely different martial paths. Just as people perceive mountains, rivers, winds, and snow in their unique ways, so too did martial practitioners interpret their teachings, which is why it's often said, "A teacher leads you to the door; your cultivation is up to you."

Standing up, Chen Ping'an practiced a six-step stance, slowly stretching his muscles.

Cultivating a Hero's Heart was key to breaking through to the sixth stage.

The so-called Hero's Heart was not a tangible object, but rather the cultivation of pure genuine energy coupled with the martial spirit. Its significance was akin to the Golden Elixir of a cultivator.

Previously, Chen Ping'an had claimed he was only two points away from breaking through. Now, with a Hero's Heart, only one point remained. In reality, his physical resilience had long matched that of the Golden Body stage. The training he endured under Cui Cheng’s fists, along with his sparring with Zhu Lian, the refining in the thunderclouds of tribulation, and countless fights on his journey, combined with his relentless practice, all contributed to his external cultivation as a pure martial artist.

However, this final point was likely the biggest bottleneck, a chasm separating him from stepping into the Golden Body stage.

But Chen Ping'an wasn’t anxious. The larger the bottleneck, the greater his chances of becoming the strongest at the sixth stage.

The notion of being the "strongest" had rarely crossed his mind. The strongest at the third stage had been hammered out of him by the elder at the bamboo building on Ruined Peak, independent of Chen Ping'an’s own desires. It wasn't a matter of whether he wished to claim it or not; it had fallen into the hands of Cui Cheng, a tenth stage martial artist. Could Chen Ping'an simply refuse to accept that?

One of the fundamental threads in Chen Ping'an's mental path was the saying from Old Yao, "What is meant for you will come to you; what is not yours, don’t even think about it." In essence, it echoed the Buddhist plaque at the Crab Shop that read, "Do not seek externally," which naturally extended to the idea of "Eight feet in destiny, do not seek a foot more." This was a principle Chen Ping'an considered self-evident, and thus, over the long years, every word and action he took was influenced by it.

For instance, he had twice repelled the martial fortunes of Old Dragon City. Moreover, he almost never sought opportunities in blessed lands, preferring to "pick up scraps for small gains."

When ordinary folk see a creek, they often only notice the flowing water, unaware of the riverbed beneath.

Chen Ping'an had once been no different. It was only during his journey through the Northern Julu Continent, constantly observing others and contemplating the Dao, that he began to gradually understand this principle.

"To know others is intelligence; to know oneself is enlightenment."

It was a difficult task.

Only through repeated scrutiny and ultimately distilling knowledge down to its essence could one truly claim it as their own.

Returning to sit by the creek, he glanced southward, not sure what memories stirred within him, and a smile broke across his face as he mimicked a gesture of cracking chestnuts.

He wondered how Pei Qian was faring in her studies at the academy.

A ferryboat from the Bone Marsh’s Pima Sect slowly docked at Niujiao Mountain in Longquan County.

A slender woman, wearing a veil and holding a mountain staff, was accompanied by a protector radiating the aura of the Golden Elixir.

It was Su Jingcheng, accompanied by the Nascent Soul sword cultivator Rong Chang from Floating Water Sword Lake.

Once the ferry entered the jurisdiction of Baoping Continent, Su Jingcheng often stepped out of her cabin to gaze at the mountains and rivers of the other continents.

Beneath her feet lay the Great Li Dynasty.

Earlier, as Rong Chang had entered the territory of Longzhou, which had transformed from a blessed land back into a common domain, he gazed at the distant Peak of Clouds and remarked, “The landscape here is truly astounding; it deserves its title as the Northern Mount of a continent.”

While the Northern Julu Continent also boasted numerous Five Peaks, none could compare to the breathtakingly majestic Peak of Clouds.

Hearing that the mountain deity Wei Bo of Northern Mount was about to break through to the upper five realms, Rong Chang couldn’t help but sigh, realizing that having a mountain deity presiding over one’s territory was akin to a sage overseeing a microcosm. This required viewing from a higher perspective. If Wei Bo were to ascend to the Jade Purity realm, the Great Li would effectively possess a deity of the Immortal realm, and while combat prowess might not be of utmost importance, the stability of the Great Li’s fortunes and the essence of the mountains and rivers in the Northern Mount region would be all the more secured.

According to Su Jingcheng, Wei Bo shared a close relationship with a certain senior.

As night fell, the number of ferries at Niujiao Mountain was limited, making the Pima Sect ferry particularly noteworthy.

The ferry would remain here for the night, setting off only the next evening to allow passengers from the Northern Julu Continent to explore this broken, fallen blessed land. It was said that a fairy shop had just opened at Niujiao Mountain, and whether one could find bargains depended on their resources and discernment. However, the ferry's management had made it clear to all passengers that once they entered the jurisdiction of Baoping Continent’s Northern Mount, it was no longer Northern Julu Continent. Furthermore, with the sage Ruan Qiong from the Wind and Snow Temple overseeing, rules were strict, and one could not recklessly fly on the wind or draw swords. Anyone causing trouble after disembarking would not have the Pima Sect to rely on.

At the dock, a charming man dressed in white appeared, adorned with a golden earring, a smile on his face as he looked toward Su Jingcheng and Rong Chang.

He was surrounded by fluttering spirit birds, with a faint glow of auspicious light shimmering around him.

Rong Chang could not gauge his depth, but his identity was clear; he was the highest-ranked mountain deity in the entire Baoping Continent, Wei Bo.

Su Jingcheng stepped forward quickly, softly asking, “Are you the Mountain Deity Wei?”

Wei Bo glanced at the mountain staff in Su Jingcheng's hands, raised his hand to gently disperse the flying birds, and smiled as he nodded, “I received word from your flying sword and came to welcome you.”

Rong Chang was somewhat taken aback.

How could a mountain deity be so polite and warm? To personally come and greet them, after all, they were merely strangers from afar. 

In Baoping Continent, it might not be surprising for a Nascent Soul sword cultivator like Rong Chang to receive such treatment, but in the Great Li’s Peak of Clouds, he didn't feel he deserved such honor.

This territory had once been the domain of the Li Pearl Blessed Land, and it was home to many hidden talents.

The Northern Julu Continent’s Celestial Lord Xie Shi and the Southern Posa Continent’s Sword Immortal Cao Xi were just two examples, both rumored to hail from small town streets.

So here, no one could boast about their cultivation level; it would be a mere joke.

Su Jingcheng, feeling a bit anxious, performed a deep bow, “Thank you for your kindness, Mountain Deity Wei.”

Wei Bo waved his hand with a friendly smile, “There is no need for such formality, Su Miss. Do you wish to explore the Baofu Studio at Niujiao Mountain or head straight to Ruined Peak?”

Su Jingcheng replied, “Let’s go to Ruined Peak first.”

Wei Bo nodded, performing a technique that brought Su Jingcheng and Rong Chang directly to the foot of Ruined Peak.

Rong Chang was taken aback.

This Great Li Northern Mount deity was likely on the verge of ascending to the upper five realms; the degree of harmony with the landscape was simply astonishing.

Mountains and rivers compressed into mere inches, yet being swept along on a distant journey, Rong Chang noticed that his own life sword barely stirred.

Wei Bo apologized, “After all, this is Chen Ping'an’s territory. I cannot directly take you to the halfway house; it would be a bother for Miss Su and Sword Immortal Rong to walk up the mountain.”

At the entrance to the mountain, a hunchbacked man, barefoot, came rushing out. Upon seeing the veiled woman, he immediately lost interest in the man.

Wei Bo introduced, “This is Brother Zheng Da Feng, the gatekeeper of Ruined Peak.”

Zheng Da Feng stood beside Wei Bo, rubbing his hands and smiling, “You must be Miss Su, right? Would you like to come to my house for a bit? I can prepare a midnight snack for you and Wei Bo, just as a welcome for Miss Su. After a good meal, resting overnight is also fine. My place is spacious, with many rooms. It’s no trouble even if you bring a few friends along… By the way, my surname is Zheng; you can call me Brother Zheng, no need for formalities.”

Su Jingcheng was caught off guard.

Wei Bo sighed, “Miss Su and Sword Immortal Rong, it’s entirely up to you whether to take a break for a midnight snack or head straight up the mountain.”

As a result, Su Jingcheng and Rong Chang watched as the hunchbacked man stepped on Wei Bo's foot with a constant smile, “It’s just a midnight snack; it’s no trouble at all.”

Su Jingcheng cautiously replied, “Then let’s go up the mountain. There are some matters I need to discuss with Mountain Deity Wei in detail; the flying sword message cannot be disclosed too much.”

Zheng Da Feng sighed, twisting his foot firmly on Wei Bo's boot. Wei Bo maintained his composure, saying to Su Jingcheng, “Alright.”

Rong Chang nearly broke out in a sweat, his sword heart wavering.

The four of them began to ascend the mountain together.

Zheng Da Feng lowered his voice, complaining, “How can this be so ungrateful?”

Wei Bo laughed, “Let’s discuss serious matters first.”

Zheng Da Feng retorted, “Brother’s lifelong affairs aren’t serious matters? Damn it, those in drought suffer while those in flood drown.”

Wei Bo smiled, “The book has its own beauty, and the painting has its fair share of charm.”

Zheng Da Feng lamented, “In the end, it’s still lacking a bit of essence.”

Wei Bo patted Zheng Da Feng’s shoulder, comforting him, “You’re a fine-looking guy; why fear not finding a wife?”

Zheng Da Feng elbowed Wei Bo, “If this kind of talk came from Chen Ping'an, I would feel quite confident, how about you?”

As Su Jingcheng ascended, she glanced around, her mind immersed. This was the home of the predecessors.

Meanwhile, Rong Chang was puzzled, unable to discern the background of the hunchbacked man, who appeared to be a pure martial artist, seemingly a half-wreckage of the Dao. Why was he so familiar with Wei Bo? The key was that neither of them seemed to feel anything was amiss.

Su Jingcheng slowed her pace as a young woman descended the mountain, practicing her martial arts. The stances appeared somewhat familiar, prompting Su Jingcheng to scrutinize her features. Thankfully, she was pretty, but not excessively so.

Zheng Da Feng greeted her with a laugh, “Cen Meizi, practicing martial arts so late, you are truly hardworking. Brother Zheng notices you’ve lost weight.”

Cen Yuji merely practiced her stances, ignoring him, her focus unwavering.

As she continued her descent, Zheng Da Feng nodded in appreciation, “No worries; it’s right to not see Brother Da Feng in your eyes. One must concentrate on their training; after all, as long as you keep Brother Da Feng in your heart, that’s enough.”

Wei Bo sighed, “Don’t distract Cen Yuji from her training.”

Zheng Da Feng scoffed, “I’m helping her refine her mindset; you wouldn’t understand, being no martial artist. This girl practices her punches back and forth between the mountaintop and the foot, but where’s the real barrier? It’s right at the entrance of my gate. Don’t underestimate me sitting on a small stool doing nothing; my fierce gaze and cryptic words, how many ordinary martial artists can withstand them?”

Wei Bo seemed to have an epiphany, nodding, “Right, right, what you said is all true.”

Rong Chang was left puzzled. How could this man, with those words and that kind of gaze, not have been beaten to death growing up in a small town?

Or was it that he had suffered a heavy blow, and the path of martial arts had collapsed midway, leading him to be here as the gatekeeper? Was he forced to rely on Chen Ping'an, living under someone else’s roof?

Or was there more to the story? One could not judge a book by its cover.

Zheng Da Feng cheerfully said, “You really shouldn’t doubt me; that Li woman couldn’t withstand it either. One day, Cen Yuji will express her gratitude for Brother Da Feng’s good intentions; that scene will surely be touching.”

Wei Bo didn’t feel the need to comment further.

Rong Chang’s uncertainty about his sword heart was evident.

Zheng Da Feng paused before shifting his gaze, puzzled, “Sword Immortal Rong, do you also have some insights into the Dao? That doesn’t seem right; my approach generally only targets women.”

Rong Chang smiled, “Nothing much, just some reflections after being away from home for so long.”

Yet, he no longer dared to regard the hunchbacked man as an ordinary person.

The slight tremor of his life sword in his heart lake could not be sensed by an average martial arts master.

By the time they reached the halfway point, Zhu Lian was already there, smiling to greet them.

After entering Zhu Lian's residence, Rong Chang took his leave, and Zheng Da Feng led him to another lodging.

Rong Chang had no worries about Su Jingcheng facing any danger.

The aura of a mountain deity could be sensed just by observing the mountains and rivers within their jurisdiction.

Wei Bo’s Dao was undoubtedly profound and far-reaching.

A young mountain master capable of easily connecting with Liu Jinglong, as well as having a good relationship with Wei Bo, indicated that his family background was not difficult to ascertain.

On the way, Rong Chang and Zheng Da Feng encountered a young girl in a pink skirt.

Zheng Da Feng laughed, “Chen girl, no need to pretend to be busy; the house is sure to be spotless. By the way, this is a guest from the Northern Julu Continent, Sword Immortal Rong.”

Chen Ruchu quickly bowed and greeted, “I’m Chen Ruchu, a little maid from Ruined Peak. Greetings to Sword Immortal Rong.”

Rong Chang smiled.

A little fiery python of literary talent?

What an odd affair.

Chen Ruchu pulled out a large bunch of keys, expertly selecting a small set, and after unlocking the door, she handed the keys to Rong Chang, meticulously explaining which key corresponded to which door. She also mentioned that after settling in, it wouldn’t matter if the doors were left unlocked or closed, as she would clean the rooms twice a day. If Sword Immortal Rong didn’t wish to be disturbed, it was fine; if he needed tea or water, she was not far away and could be called upon.

After finishing her lengthy explanation, she quietly followed the two into the residence. It was indeed clean and tidy; while it didn't have the ethereal atmosphere of a celestial abode, nor the opulence of a royal family, it was quite comfortable to behold.

Rong Chang found nothing to complain about.

Zheng Da Feng chuckled, “Zhu Lian is the head steward of Ruined Peak, and Chen girl is the little steward. Sometimes Zhu Lian has to defer to her, and I must say I quite like Chen girl.”

Chen Ruchu smiled shyly.

Rong Chang pondered for a moment, just as he was about to take out a small gift to present to the amiable girl, Chen Ruchu was already preparing to take her leave.

Yet, Zheng Da Feng playfully held her head down, causing her to stop.

Rong Chang produced a small, charming spirit tool, a golden bamboo incense burner. It wasn’t expensive, but was worth a few small coins.

Chen Ruchu hesitated, feeling that it was a bit too valuable. She could roughly gauge the amount of spiritual essence contained in celestial tools.

However, Zheng Da Feng smiled, “What are you being so formal about? Quickly take it.”

Chen Ruchu accepted the small incense burner with both hands and bowed in thanks.

After Rong Chang settled in, Zheng Da Feng left the residence, noticing that the girl in the pink skirt still stood nearby.

Zheng Da Feng asked with a smile, “Where’s Chen Lingjun? I haven’t seen him around lately; where has he wandered off to?”

Chen Ruchu softly replied, “He’s been making a fuss over by the Crawfish Back; he has such a playful heart.”

Now, their family owned many peaks.

Aside from the three-hundred-year lease to the Longquan Sword Sect for Baolu Mountain, Cloud Peak, and Herb Mountain, they also had Ruined Peak and Pearl Mountain.

Later, they acquired the massive Grey Mist Mountain, located very close to Ruined Peak, the former Niujiao Mountain after the Baofu Studio left, and Zhu Sha Mountain, vacated by the Xu family of Qingfeng City, as well as Crawfish Back and Weixia Peak, along with the Sword Offering Platform located at the westernmost edge of the mountains. Now, all six of these peaks belonged to their family. Aside from Sister Xiu Xiu’s family, their family had the most peaks in Longquan County.

Zheng Da Feng revealed the truth, “He just can’t stand seeing Pei Qian struggling in her martial training. Plus, in comparison, he feels like he’s wasting his time, so he’d rather not see it and just runs off to make trouble.”

Chen Ruchu's expression dimmed.

Pei Qian's training was indeed too harsh. 

It was not even half as easy as when their master practiced martial arts back in the day.

After preparing the bucket, each time she had to carry the unconscious Pei Qian down from the second floor of the bamboo building, she would have to clean the bloodstains with the bucket afterward.

There was blood on the floor and walls.

Seeing it made her tears flow, and several times while cleaning the blood, she would glance at the elder who sat cross-legged, meditating.

Unfortunately, the elder only pretended to be oblivious.

Zheng Da Feng patted the little girl’s head, “You should rest soon. Doing the same thing all day, it feels like doing it for a hundred or a thousand years; you don’t find it boring? I would have to admire you for that. If that Chen Lingjun had even half your patience and heart, he could rely on his own abilities to impress others. Why does he need to rely on Chen Ping'an and seek a place at Wei Bo’s side daily?”

Chen Ruchu felt guilty, “But my cultivation is too slow; I can’t help with anything.”

Zheng Da Feng sighed, “Don’t think like that. Without you, Ruined Peak would lose half its warmth.”

Chen Ruchu’s eyes widened, her spirit lifted, “Really?”

Zheng Da Feng laughed, “Don’t get cocky; keep it up.”

The little girl in the pink skirt was likely the one who ran around the most on Ruined Peak, coming and going alone, quietly doing trivial chores.

It seemed that no one noticed her.

But in reality, everyone cared for her.

At Ruined Peak, if someone like Lu Baixiang was bullied outside, upon hearing about it, Chen Ping'an, with his strong temperament, might take his time to discuss reason first.

But if that little girl in the pink skirt faced bullying outside, would Chen Ping'an still be so patient?

Zheng Da Feng hugged his head, walking slowly without interfering in Zhu Lian's courtyard. He trusted Zhu Lian, who was meticulous, so there was no need for him to worry. As for the veiled beauty visiting Ruined Peak, Zheng Da Feng had seen her, and that was enough.

It was like the scene back in the dusty apothecary of Old Dragon City.

The autumn night was particularly bright.

Zheng Da Feng descended the mountain slowly, looking forward to the day when Chen Ping'an would go down the mountain to discuss reason with others.

For example, at Zhengyang Mountain. Or in the Great Li’s capital city.

The most interesting part would be when Chen Ping'an decided to go; it would certainly be his reason, and no matter whether he spoke or not, others would have to listen.

However, Zheng Da Feng also looked forward to who would eventually settle in those peaks outside of Ruined Peak.

But what he anticipated the most was, if one day Ruined Peak finally established its own sect, what name it would take.

Previously, when they casually mentioned this, he, Zhu Lian, and Wei Bo exchanged knowing smiles, laughing without restraint.

At the small courtyard on the mountain, Zhu Lian and Wei Bo had listened to Su Jingcheng's detailed account, mostly about Chen Ping'an's experiences and encounters along the way.

 ### Chapter 625: The Foundations of Ruined Mountain (Part Two)

Wei Ban accepted the walking stick, preparing to send it to Cui Dongshan via his own Piyun Mountain. This was more appropriate than sending it as Zhu Lian from Ruined Mountain.

In addition to the walking stick, Sui Jingcheng personally penned a secret letter, which Chen Pingan had instructed her to deliver to the esteemed Senior Cui. Sui Jingcheng was reluctant to share these words face-to-face with Zhu Lian and Wei Ban.

It wasn’t that she didn’t trust Zhu Lian and Wei Ban; it was simply in her nature. In this regard, she and Chen Pingan were quite similar.

Wei Ban accepted the secret letter as well.

Sui Jingcheng let out a sigh of relief. 

Now, before she met the legendary Mr. Cui, as described by the seniors, she just needed to enjoy her time wandering the beautiful landscapes of Baoping Continent under the protection of a senior brother, a Yuan Ying swordsman. 

However, she planned to stay for a while at Ruined Mountain and Longquan County first.

After all, there were many reasons; for instance, to meet the senior disciple Pei Qian, to visit the immortal shop at the Niu Jiao Mountain ferry, and how could she not visit Wei Shan Shen’s Piyun Mountain? This place was once one of the Thirty-Six Minor Paradises, the Lvzhu Paradise, so it deserved a leisurely stroll, didn’t it? She could even head north to the capital city of Dali for a look, then take the ferry back from the Niu Jiao Mountain ferry, allowing her to rest for a while.

Sui Jingcheng was led by a cute little girl, delicately carved like jade, to the residence.

Wei Ban first went to Piyun Mountain to send off the walking stick and secret letter, before returning to Zhu Lian's courtyard.

Zhu Lian was walking slowly, contemplating various matters.

Wei Ban didn’t disturb him and poured himself a cup of tea.

To put it simply, the cultivation level of the water deities could be intuitively displayed through their golden bodies, while cultivators were measured by the amount of spiritual energy accumulated in their Qi chambers.

In Wei Ban’s view, among the four individuals depicted in the painting of the Lotus Flower Paradise—Wei Xian, the founding emperor of the South Garden Kingdom, Lu Baixiang, the leader of the demonic sect, and Sui You, the female sword immortal—they each had their own extraordinary lives and stood at the peak of the mortal realm of the Lotus Flower Paradise. However, when it came to their state of mind, none could match Zhu Lian’s “perfection without flaw” and “meticulousness.” 

Born into a wealthy family with a history of power and influence, he quietly practiced martial arts while casually reading books, a prodigy from a young age who had already excelled in the imperial examinations. After a period of obscurity in the officialdom, he smoothly entered the court and quickly rose to prominence, bringing glory to his family. Later, he wandered the Jianghu, living a carefree life, having experienced the muddy depths of the lower-class world. Ultimately, when the world was on the brink of collapse, he stood against the tide, returning to the court, engaging in battles, and forsaking his unparalleled martial skills to support the chaotic world merely as a Confucian general, and later returning to the Jianghu, transforming from a noble youth into a wild martial lunatic.

This was why Zhu Lian, even in the Haoran world, remained indifferent and showed little interest in anything. To him, the world was still just the world; it was merely a larger version of the Lotus Flower Paradise, but human hearts remained unchanged, unable to produce much variation.

In short, Zhu Lian had never truly engaged himself.

Sui You hoped to ascend truly as a sword cultivator.

Wei Xian had the heart of an emperor, ambitious and cunning, attempting to rise again, seeking to command more troops and power than a lord of a paradise.

Lu Baixiang wished to start anew in the Jianghu, slowly accumulating strength, ultimately establishing a sect, and one day breaking away from Ruined Mountain to stand tall against the celestial beings above.

Each of the three had their desires and had found their own paths in this new world.

As for Zhu Lian?

He was without desire or pursuit.

Zhu Lian's state of mind had already transcended all constraints.

To put it bluntly, Zhu Lian could rely on his looks alone to fill his stomach, yet even without focusing on the arts of music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, he was already proficient.

To put it nicely, the astonishing Zhu Lian could, like Sui You, turn to cultivation and could achieve a realm of great advancement in mere days, breaking through barriers as easily as slicing through bamboo.

Zhu Lian snapped back to reality, stopping in his tracks and smiling, “Sorry, I was a bit lost in thought.”

Wei Ban poured him a cup of tea. Once Zhu Lian sat down, he gently twisted the porcelain cup and asked slowly, “How did the secret discussion about purchasing the golden body fragments go with Cui Dongshan?”

This was a critical secret matter that Zhu Lian, Wei Ban, and Zheng Dafeng had deliberated on. Once the Lotus Flower Paradise became a private property of Ruined Mountain and entered the ranks of intermediate paradises, it would require a large number of water deities, the more, the better, since the incense offerings from the mortal realm were crucial for Ruined Mountain, and they wouldn't need to spend a penny for it. However, the golden body fragments were directly related to the Dali court; even if Wei Ban were to speak up, it wouldn't be a simple task. Therefore, they needed Cui Dongshan to weigh the situation and engage in some discreet transactions with the immortal sects in the southern part of Baoping Continent. If the Dali court were to catch wind of this, they would simply turn a blind eye, which was enough for Ruined Mountain.

Wei Ban replied, “I’m still waiting.”

Suddenly, Wei Ban chuckled. “I believe that once the walking stick is sent, your young master’s student, who initially had seven or eight points of strength, will muster all his energy and be willing to spend twelve parts of his effort to deal with us.”

Zhu Lian nodded, “Cui Dongshan is someone we must be extremely cautious with when dealing with.”

Zhu Lian held a deep wariness towards Cui Dongshan.

They were essentially of the same ilk.

Zhu Lian would never let his guard down simply because of Cui Dongshan's complicated relationship with Chen Pingan.

Furthermore, Zheng Dafeng had mentioned that a person well-versed in the workings of the paradises would soon arrive at Ruined Mountain.

This was also good news.

While Ruined Mountain didn't gain any extra incense money, every piece of insight this person provided about the inner workings of the paradise equated to saving Ruined Mountain a sum of incense money.

Previously, Sun Jiashu had ascended the mountain in person, showing great sincerity.

The Sun family from Laolong City was willing to provide three hundred incense coins, only requiring interest in return, with no need for a share of future profits from the Lotus Flower Paradise for him or his family.

The Fan family was also willing to provide three hundred coins under the same conditions. It wouldn't be the head of the Fan family, but a young man named Fan Er, who would be the borrower.

However, both families had their own detailed requirements. For example, Sun Jiashu requested that Ruined Mountain must provide a named worshipper for the Sun family within fifty years, either a wandering realm martial artist or a Yuan Ying cultivator. This would only require Ruined Mountain to assist them once in a time of crisis, after which the contract would be void. Additionally, the Sun family planned to establish a ferry route from Laolong City in the south all the way north, with the ferry ending at the Niu Jiao Mountain ferry rather than the Changchun Palace in the Dali court. This required Wei Ban and Ruined Mountain to provide some assistance and help establish connections with the Dali court.

Even with these additional conditions requiring gradual adjustment from both sides, this time, when Sun Jiashu lent the money, he only sought interest, ensuring that the Sun family from Laolong City would have guaranteed returns.

However, now that Baoping Continent was undergoing dramatic changes, filled with countless opportunities for wealth, the Sun family had nearly emptied their coffers betting on Ruined Mountain, which was certainly not the best choice. The real business savvy would be to let the money grow legs and find investments in the vast areas south of Guanhuxueyuan and north of Laolong City, allowing profits to compound. According to the gradually clarified situation, the Sun family would not only earn returns but also befriend the Dali court and the new Song emperor. Once Dali annexed a continent, such covert investments would help expand the financial paths for future generations of the Sun family.

Zhu Lian suddenly said, “Once the shop at the Baguzhai opens, if all goes well, the new emperor of Dali will likely send over a sum of golden coins or a batch of golden body fragments. Piyun Mountain can simply accept it to prevent the young emperor from overthinking. Wise people, once they have too much time on their hands, tend to become suspicious, which isn’t ideal. But let’s make it clear beforehand: relationships are relationships, and business is business; we will still purchase at the lower price from you at Piyun Mountain.”

Wei Ban smiled, “Of course.”

Then he added, “It would be even better if we could remove the words ‘lower price.’”

From hosting the second night banquet to opening his own Baguzhai at Niu Jiao Mountain, Wei Ban had intentions beyond merely making a small fortune from the immortal money.

Since even the North岳 deity needed to gather a large amount of immortal money to aid in breaking through, how could the Dali court stand idly by? One could even say that the new emperor of Dali, more than anyone else on Baoping Continent, hoped for Wei Ban to smoothly ascend to the fifth realm! The bigger the commotion, the better! Ideally, it would be a grand event that would herald blessings for a thousand miles around. What did that mean? It meant that Song He would be most appropriately positioned, and the heavens would rejoice!

Wei Ban was the only newly appointed mountain god among the five mountains conferred by the former emperor.

However, Wei Ban was also a mountain deity from the glorious land of Dali, a pivotal existence, as the capital of Dali was right under Wei Ban’s watch.

Thus, how to skillfully win over “the old ministers of the previous dynasty,” like Wei Ban, could easily become a thorn in the side of the new emperor of Dali. Over time, without communication, it could become a constant concern for the emperor. Hence, it was necessary for Wei Ban and Piyun Mountain to provide a way for the Dali court to smoothly descend from its lofty heights, doing so comfortably and without stiffness.

So when Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafeng first mentioned this matter, why did Wei Ban hesitate for a moment before agreeing?

Because at that time, the three individuals present in the small courtyard were all adept at chess, each thinking several moves ahead.

Wei Ban hesitated for a moment, “I won’t ask how you suddenly learned about the situation in the Lotus Flower Paradise?”

Zhu Lian waved his hand, “No need to tell me. For what can be said, the three of us have already spoken freely without holding back. For things that are inconvenient to discuss, there is no need for any of us to ask or answer; it’s pointless.”

Wei Ban raised his tea cup, “Let’s toast with tea instead of wine.”

Zhu Lian quickly draped an arm around Wei Ban’s shoulder, lifting his tea cup with both hands, smiling flatteringly, “I can’t possibly accept a toast from the great Wei.”

After the two finished their tea, Wei Ban laughed, “It’s a pity that Brother Dafeng isn’t here.”

Zhu Lian touched the back of his head, “In terms of being human, neither of us can compare to him.”

Wei Ban didn’t disagree.

After all, he was not a human.

This was a freebie Zhu Lian had snagged.

Gaining advantages from this old chef, whether in chess or business, was truly not easy.

Wei Ban stood up, smiling, “I won’t disturb you while you prepare your midnight snack.”

Zhu Lian nodded, sighing, “At first, I was quite tough, but now I feel a bit apprehensive. When my young master returns to Ruined Mountain, I suspect I’ll need to find a place to hide with you.”

Wei Ban showed a hint of schadenfreude, his expression fleeting.

Zhu Lian got up to open the door.

On the other side was a girl with arms hanging limply, her head knocking against the door.

It seemed she hadn’t managed to wake up the right-hand protector from Qilong Alley.

Zhu Lian opened the door, and Pei Qian staggered across the threshold, trembling as she said, “Old chef, I can’t sleep. Can we chat for a bit?”

Zhu Lian closed the door, smiling, “What’s wrong with that?”

Pei Qian sat on a stool, grinning widely, her discomfort evident.

Tonight, she wasn’t just unable to sleep; she was awake due to the pain, desperately wishing to slap herself for her previous claims that bedding was her greatest enemy. Wasn’t that coming true now? The light bedding felt like knives on her.

Zhu Lian asked, “Aren’t you hungry? How about a midnight snack? It’ll be quick.”

Pei Qian shook her head, looking ill. “I have no appetite.”

Zhu Lian pressed, “Do you have something on your mind?”

Pei Qian hummed in response, yet remained silent.

Zhu Lian queried further, “Is it the growing debts that are troubling you?”

Pei Qian nodded, gloomily saying, “The old man says I have a few days before I can break through to the third realm. By then, I’ll barely have some time to copy books, but those days are fleeting, and soon I’ll be clumsy again. It’s driving me crazy.”

Zhu Lian listened, allowing the blackened girl to speak without interruption.

Pei Qian looked up at the large moon above, “Before, over in Qilong Alley, I always thought that one day, my master would just come home. Now that I think about it, I want my master to come back, but I’m also scared. If my master finds out I haven’t copied books for so many days... what if he gets angry and kicks me out of the sect? What then?”

The little girl frowned, pouting, tears welling in her eyes, feeling wronged. “My master has done that before. When we first left the Lotus Flower Paradise, in a place called the Daqing Dynasty on Tongye Continent, he kicked me out once. Just think about it, my master is someone who would stick it out even when his straw sandals are worn out; how could he just kick me out?”

At that time, I didn’t understand. My master could throw me out and then take me back. Now that I understand, if my master kicks me out again, he really won’t want me anymore.”

Zhu Lian gently asked, “Are you afraid of that? So you don’t dare to grow up?”

Pei Qian struggled to raise her elbow to wipe her face, “How can I not be afraid? What’s so good about growing up?”

In reality, Zhu Lian had previously explained the matter of copying books to Pei Qian; she must have taken that to heart.

So the real reason was something Pei Qian could not voice, something buried deep within her heart.

Zhu Lian could roughly guess but chose not to reveal it.

Back then, Chen Pingan had told Pei Qian in person that the one he truly wanted to take out of the Lotus Flower Paradise was Cao Qinglang.

At that time, Chen Pingan, who was on the opposite end of the spectrum from Pei Qian, didn’t hide his dislike for her.

The so-called growth, in Zhu Lian’s view, was merely more weighing of pros and cons.

Pei Qian was in a very awkward position.

She was not ignorant of weighing the pros and cons; on the contrary, as a little orphan who had suffered greatly, she was most adept at reading people and calculating gains and losses.

But after following Chen Pingan, she found that her greatest strengths only served to distance her from him.

Thus, she had always feared growing up, silently imitating Chen Pingan, trying to become a Pei Qian who could earn Chen Pingan’s approval.

There was nothing wrong with that.

Because Chen Pingan had enough patience to wait for Pei Qian to grow up slowly, and he was more than willing to teach her different rules, etiquette, and ways of dealing with the world at various stages of her life.

Yet nobody had anticipated that the Lotus Flower Paradise would split into four, and when Zhu Lian and Pei Qian entered, they just happened to witness that scene.

In fact, if Pei Qian had only seen that seemingly grown Qing Shan boy appearing with an umbrella in the Lotus Flower Paradise, it would have been fine.

The problem lay in the fact that early on, Pei Qian had witnessed Chen Pingan holding an umbrella and walking in the rain with Cao Qinglang in that narrow alley.

After arriving in the Haoran world, she saw a remarkably similar scene in Cui Dongshan's scroll of time, where the straw sandal youth walked alongside the person he respected the most, both holding umbrellas against the rain.

Thus, Pei Qian would say that she could lose to anyone, but she could not lose to Cao Qinglang.

Because Pei Qian feared that the already grown and outstanding Cao Qinglang would take away everything that should rightfully belong to him.

Pei Qian was terrified that one day, in the rain, her master would hold an umbrella and walk side by side with Cao Qinglang, gradually drifting away, never to turn back.

So, standing in Ruined Mountain and the Haoran world, Pei Qian felt as if she had returned to the entrance of that small alley in the Lotus Flower Paradise.

With nothing at all.

When Pei Qian saw Cao Qinglang again in the Lotus Flower Paradise, it felt like falling into an ice cave, her hands and feet icy, and her heart filled with murderous intent!

Yet between finding the opportunity to kill Cao Qinglang and inevitably losing her master and actively growing up to surpass Cao Qinglang, Pei Qian, influenced by Chen Pingan, after stepping out of the Lotus Flower Paradise and the Tongye Umbrella, when she stood before the bamboo tower of Ruined Mountain again.

She chose the latter.

Zhu Lian carefully crafted his words and asked, “If your master returns to Ruined Mountain and meets Cao Qinglang, liking him very much, would you be very sad?”

Pei Qian thought for a moment, “As long as he likes me the most, I’d be very happy. If he likes me as much as he likes Cao Qinglang, I’d be a little unhappy. But if he likes Cao Qinglang more than me... that would... be very sad.”

Zhu Lian laughed, saying, “You can rest easy. In the three scenarios I mentioned, I dare not say too much. At the very least, you can secure the second and compete for the first.”

Pei Qian rolled her eyes, “You’re not my master, so your words are meaningless.”

Though she said this, she was actually a bit pleased.

Zhu Lian stifled a laugh, “Believe it or not, but after practicing boxing for so long and accumulating so many debts without breaking through to the third realm, that’s a bit inappropriate.”

Pei Qian let out a heavy sigh, her face scrunching up, “True. The old man also says I’m not particularly talented, even worse than my master. Isn’t that just nonsense? How can I compare to my master? It’s driving me crazy!”

Zhu Lian felt a shiver run through him.

He had merely made a joke with Pei Qian, yet that old fellow was even more ruthless, spouting such heartless words so casually, as if he had fed his conscience to the dogs?!

Zhu Lian rubbed his forehead.

He didn’t really want to talk anymore.

The bottleneck of the third realm for pure martial artists was the first threshold, which could even be described as the greatest barrier determining the ultimate height of a martial artist.

Its significance was equivalent to a peak martial artist breaking through the great threshold to successfully ascend to the tenth realm.

If an ordinary person were to teach martial arts, such astonishingly rapid breakthroughs could be explained by an insufficient foundation; one could never hope to achieve the title of “strongest,” every step being as fragile as paper.

But what about that person in the bamboo tower? 

In his hands, it seemed as if nothing in the world had a foundation that wouldn’t crumble; only a stronger one existed.

Suddenly, Pei Qian looked up and asked, “Old chef, what realm are you in?”

Zhu Lian smiled, “I’m in the eighth realm, the Wandering Realm.”

Pei Qian lowered her head, her fingers moving as she calculated, then sighed again, raising her head with a face full of disappointment, “Old chef, then it seems I won’t be able to catch up to you for several years.”

Zhu Lian’s smile froze, “It seems... that’s true.”

Zhu Lian then asked in confusion, “What realm is your master in? You don’t know?”

Pei Qian looked at Zhu Lian as if he were a fool, shaking her head and saying, “My master is currently in the sixth realm.”

Zhu Lian was even more puzzled, “Isn’t your young master two realms below me? Why haven’t you caught up to your master’s realm?”

Pei Qian looked dazed, as if saying, “Are you that slow on the uptake?” She shook her head, speaking with an air of wisdom, “Old chef, you must be dreaming at night. My master’s realm doesn’t just count as one level, it’s practically doubled.”

Zhu Lian was genuinely impressed.

Pei Qian shook her head and nodded, her mood lifting.

Suddenly, she leaped up, her toes tapping lightly, gracefully landing on the wall, then silently leaping onto the roof, crossing to the eaves with a single bound, gazing northward.

Perhaps she didn’t realize yet what it meant for one’s punches to embody true intent, startling the gods and spirits.

It seemed likely that she wouldn’t need to stick talismans to her forehead for much longer.

Zhu Lian suddenly remembered something, his expression changing sharply. After a moment of silence, he asked sternly, “Pei Qian, what did the old man say to you when you were hiccupping earlier?”

Pei Qian merely looked northward, vexed, “He said I deserve a beating.”

In fact, that old man had shown a face of disdain, saying her martial arts level resembled an ant moving a house and a tortoise crawling along. However, that was something she preferred to keep to herself; otherwise, with a loudmouth like the old chef, the entire Ruined Mountain might know by tomorrow.

Zhu Lian slapped his forehead.

He truly regretted letting Pei Qian start learning martial arts so quickly.

Zhu Lian could imagine that when Chen Pingan returned to Ruined Mountain and discovered Pei Qian’s unusual behavior, neither he, Zheng Dafeng, nor Wei Ban would escape unscathed; they would surely be scolded severely.

While Ruined Mountain might seem filled with strange people and occurrences in the eyes of outsiders, among those who lived there, Pei Qian was perhaps the strangest.

Of course, Chen Pingan was even stranger.

All the masters in the world would be delighted to have a student like Pei Qian who was so bright.

But Chen Pingan was different.

It wasn’t that he couldn’t keep accounts; on the contrary, this young man who had served as a bookkeeper for three years at Shujian Lake was the best at calculations.

He just incredibly hoped for someone nearby, even if only one person, who could share the burdens of the carefree years when the grass grows long and the birds sing, and the willows sway.

Only then would the world feel vast, and the path ahead stretch far and wide.

Pei Qian looked down and said, “Old chef, I’m off.”

Zhu Lian nodded.

Pei Qian leaped up high, landing on the wall, then leapt away in an instant.

Just as it was written in the book that Cui Dongshan read.

“Jumping up to land on the roof, the tiles make no sound; the moon is bright, and one departs like a flying bird.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 626: His Lifelong Porcelain and Disciples (Part 1)

A young woman returning home across continents left the Bullhorn Mountain (Niujiao Shan) ferry and walked out of the great mountains toward the small town where the Huaihuang County (Huaihuang Xian) government office was located. As she passed by the little hill that resembled a mound of soil—the Pearl Mountain (Zhenzhu Shan)—she took a few lingering glances before entering the town. Her first stop was her old family home, not far from Pearl Mountain. Years ago, it had been trampled by an old beast from Zhengyang Mountain (Zhengyang Shan), forcing her family of four to move in with relatives. The subsequent discussions about repairing the house had left her mother rambling for quite some time.

She pulled out her house key and fetched two buckets of water from the nearby well, meticulously cleaning every corner of the house before locking up. After that, she made her way to the Yang family shop, which was unusually quiet. Business was tough, and only two assistants remained in the shop: a young man named Shiling Shan (Shi Ling Shan) and his senior sister, Su Dian (Su Dian), who managed the apothecary.

Shiling Shan was dozing on the counter while Su Dian sat on a long bench, quietly breathing in and out. After breaking through the third realm’s bottleneck, she had received a commendation from her senior brother Zheng Dafeng (Zheng Dafeng) that read, “The bottle broke, thunder surged; the iron cavalry carved a path,” indicating her progress was quite commendable. It would help elevate her future potential as a hero. He also advised her that once she reached the fifth realm, she should visit ancient battlefield ruins to temper her soul, which would be especially beneficial for her upcoming training in the sixth realm. However, Su Dian felt little joy—only a heavy sense of loss. She understood all too well that the bottleneck of the third realm was both a significant barrier and an immense opportunity, and the strongest path she had longed for was ultimately beyond her reach. All she could do was hope for her current training in the fourth realm.

This left Su Dian, who possessed a strong competitive spirit, even more taciturn than usual. Her martial arts training had become almost manic, divided into three types: day training, night training, and dream training, with the latter being the most mysterious. The first two were most effective under the sun and on nights of the full moon, while dream training involved lighting three incense sticks before sleep, allowing her to enter a myriad of bizarre dreams, whether battling opponents, getting caught in the chaos of the battlefield, dying suddenly, or struggling for survival. After dream training, she would not feel sluggish the next day; instead, she awoke at dawn always feeling refreshed, never delaying her daytime or nighttime training.

While Shiling Shan seemed to be napping, he was actually diligently practicing his own training method, which was simpler than Su Dian’s. It was called “wading through water,” a method of honing the body and soul while traversing the river of time.

Su Dian was unaware of her master’s true identity or his cultivation realm, but she was certain that her and her junior brother’s paths of cultivation were far from ordinary. Nowadays, Huaihuang County was bustling with divine beings, and the western mountains were home to numerous magical creatures and spirits that roamed in human form. Local youths or imprisoned disciples from the Lu family were often accepted as disciples by these cultivators. Su Dian speculated that aside from the Dragon Spring Sword Sect (Longquan Jianzong) of the Saint Ruan Qiong (Ruan Qiong), no one could rival her or her junior brother.

As Su Dian opened her eyes and looked toward the unfamiliar customer outside, Shiling Shan continued to breathe steadily, showing no signs of waking. 

Su Dian had once been a half-apprentice, half-laborer in a dragon kiln, performing arduous tasks. The dragon kiln had been the town’s primary business since ancient times, producing porcelain for the imperial court of the Great Li Dynasty (Da Li), known as the Forbidden Porcelain. In her early years, Su Dian had only managed to survive there through her uncle’s connections, relegated to chopping firewood, transporting materials, and other menial labor. Each time the kiln was opened, she could not approach the mouths of the kilns, or she would be driven away.

Thus, Su Dian was not familiar with the locals in the town, while her junior brother Shiling Shan, hailing from a wealthy family in Taoye Alley (Taoye Xiang), was accustomed to mingling with neighbors and children from well-to-do families on Fu Lu Street (Fu Lu Jie). He was quite unfamiliar with the likes of Mud Bottle Lane (Niping Xiang) and Apricot Blossom Lane (Xinghua Xiang), only knowing the more prosperous areas like Riding Dragon Lane (Qilong Xiang), which was filled with shops.

The slender young woman looked at Su Dian and softly smiled, “You must be Su Dian, right?” 

Su Dian felt a favorable impression of the guest. Her gentle demeanor reminded her of the delicate cosmetics her uncle used to speak of when he was alive. 

Su Dian nodded, rising to ask, “Are you here to gather medicine?” 

The young woman shook her head, “I’m looking for someone. My father used to work here, and my brother’s name is Li Huai (Li Huai). He often came here to play when he was younger. Have you heard of him?” 

Su Dian’s expression changed slightly. 

Li Huai? Wasn’t he the bold young scholar who seemed to have the courage of a hundred bears? 

How could such a brash boy have such a gentle sister? The woman before her resembled a willow branch in spring, her voice lovely and her features kind. She might not be the striking beauty that would immediately captivate a man, but there was something about her that was pleasing to the eye. Even Su Dian, who was herself quite attractive, found her beautiful in a way that lingered.

Su Dian softly inquired, “Are you looking for my master?” 

The woman smiled and nodded. 

Su Dian hesitated. 

Just then, Old Yang (Yang Laotou) unexpectedly appeared at the door of the shop and courtyard, lifting the curtain with his smoking pipe and smiling, “You’ve arrived, come in.” 

Li Liu (Li Liu) stepped into the courtyard. 

Old Yang settled himself on the steps, continuing to puff away, while the woman casually picked a stool to sit on. 

Old Yang spoke, “As for the new fortune you’ve acquired at the Fallen Mountain (Luopo Shan), there’s no need to hold back; it seems complicated but is actually within the rules. Those who have reached the heavens have a certain tolerance. Your current identities are both a constraint and a tool.” 

Li Liu nodded, “Zheng Dafeng didn’t just call me here for this matter, did he?” 

Old Yang hummed in acknowledgment, “Ruan Qiong happened to seek me out too, and it relates to your cave and blessed land. You can explain both matters together. The items are still with me. After your visit to Fallen Mountain, you should head to Shenhui Mountain (Shenhui Shan).” 

Li Liu’s gaze deepened. 

Old Yang chuckled, “Without the Dao, what’s there to argue about? Isn’t that a joke? As for your old grievances with her, let’s just forget about them. However, I suspect neither of you will heed my advice. Otherwise, back then… let’s not bring up old grievances. If we were to count everything, everyone has their share. If you both truly wish to compete, now isn’t the time.” 

One was a leader of the martial world, 

The other a divine being high above. 

It was merely that the great Dao had collapsed, the mountains and rivers had changed, and their appearances had shifted, but their true selves remained. 

As for why this highest-ranking and most prestigious criminal in the world was still able to survive until today, 

It would require three people to answer, two divine beings. 

Those two divine beings determined why the sword cultivator had the greatest killing power but found it difficult to ascend to the legendary fourteenth realm. One determined all martial paths in the world, explaining why they were dead ends, and also why the martial cultivators among Qi practitioners could remain almost untouched by karma. 

Li Liu suddenly said, “I think it won’t come to fruition.” 

Old Yang sneered, “Who would have thought those ants would reach the top? That they would succeed?” 

Li Liu fell silent. 

Indeed, as Old Yang had said, if one were to count, everyone has had their moments. 

Old Yang tapped the ground with his smoking pipe, causing a swirling mist to rise and settle into a small temple, which rolled on the ground before finally coming to rest. 

A small figure ran out from inside, straining to drag two large plaques, which were actually a jade tablet and a seal. 

Li Liu glanced at the two items and smiled, “The Liu Xianyang who was borrowed by the Chen family for thirty years will definitely enter the Dragon Spring Sword Sect?” 

Old Yang replied, “Ruan Qiong believes Liu Xianyang is unlikely to return, but in reality, there’s still a good chance.” 

The small figure dashed to Li Liu’s feet. 

Li Liu picked up the keys to the cave and blessed land. 

She was not particularly interested. 

Just a broken land of old mountains and rivers. 

She and Ruan Xiu, Li Er, Zheng Dafeng, Fan Junmao, and the like were quite different. 

As for the wise man Zhou Ju from the Guanhul Academy, the old Longcheng’s Sun Jiashu, and that young disciple of the small sect in the Northern Ji Lu Continent, Cui Yatou, they were even less comparable to her. 

The eight goddesses from the Wall of Bones mural city, who had left their painted heavenly abode to the Pima sect, also counted as one of the broken mountains and rivers. In fact, it could be considered one of Li Liu’s summer retreats, so whenever that Rain Goddess met Li Liu, she would become agitated, feeling as if she had encountered a high-ranking official in the secular court. This was not an illusion on the Rain Goddess’s part, for the world was indeed so. 

The eight goddesses’ responsibilities were roughly equivalent to today’s officials in the six departments of the court, but merely similar; in reality, the eight goddesses had even greater authority. They could patrol the heavens and earth, restraining, supervising, and impeaching the various divine beings, rendering them low in status yet heavy in power. 

Among those led by Old Yang along the ancient path, Li Liu was unique in that she did not need to enlighten herself; she was born with knowledge. 

Many sects had to expend significant resources to find their ancestors’ reincarnations after their grandmasters passed away. For example, the revitalized Patriarch of the Tongye Sect sent people down the mountain to find his mother. Even when they found her, there was no guarantee she would remember her past life. A good innate talent did not necessarily mean one could return to the peak of their path. 

After casually putting away the jade tablet and seal, Li Liu pondered for a moment and sighed, “You still hope we won’t bring up old grievances.” 

A Chen Ping’an was not enough; adding a Li Huai would still be insecure, which would then require Liu Xianyang to be included. 

A deeply hidden conflict of water and fire was that Chen Ping’an temporarily replaced her, Li Liu, to vie with Ruan Xiu. For in those years, the chance that truly belonged to “Mud Eel” should have been Chen Ping’an’s, not Gu Can’s. Why did Ruan Xiu take a liking to Chen Ping’an? It had become increasingly complex over time, but initially, it was not simply Chen Ping’an’s clarity of mind that attracted Ruan Xiu; rather, when Ruan Xiu first saw Chen Ping’an, it was like a gourmet spotting the world’s most delicious food, irresistible and captivating. 

Li Huai, her brother, was also a disciple of Qi Jingchun, and by coincidence, Chen Ping’an had once acted as Li Huai’s protector. If she, Li Liu, wanted to revive old grievances with Ruan Xiu, she would need to eliminate the naturally close Chen Ping’an first, seizing the path for herself. But Li Huai would absolutely not allow that to happen. Moreover, Li Liu truly did not wish for Li Huai to feel sad. 

But that was still not secure enough. 

Thus, Old Yang needed to create some reasonable possibilities for Liu Xianyang’s return to the Dragon Spring Sword Sect, such as a cave that didn’t count among the thirty-six, coupled with Liu Xianyang’s ancestral sword manual. 

With both Chen Ping’an and Liu Xianyang around, the relationship between Fallen Mountain and the Dragon Spring Sword Sect would only grow tighter. 

Old Yang did not deny anything, his gaze cold, “Everyone has their past, but you two, your mistakes are especially grave!” 

Li Liu felt neither fear nor guilt, looking up at the sky, “Perhaps.” 

Old Yang suddenly said, “Even though for you, all the mud will scatter when you shake your clothes, you still need to be careful. Otherwise, one day, the inconspicuous mud, much like the ink from that seal, will make you suffer greatly.” 

Li Liu shook her head, “You don’t need to say this to me, I’m well aware.” 

Then Li Liu smiled gently at the old man. 

Old Yang chuckled, seemingly finding excuses for himself, “Isn’t it fair for me to seek a bit of amusement after sitting in a cage for thousands of years?” 

Li Liu stifled a laugh, “My father should be fine; after all, he needs to leave some martial fortune for the Baoping Continent, but my mother doesn’t really need to go to the Northern Ji Lu Continent.” 

Old Yang fell silent, his expression darkening. 

Just thinking of that woman, who seemed to consume several pounds of arsenic every day, put him in a bad mood. 

The mother and child, Li Huai and his mother, were unlike Li Er, his father, and Li Liu, his sister; they were just ordinary people. Of course, while Li Huai was indeed a person, he was certainly not ordinary. 

There was no such thing as a child that could be stepped on in a line like that; the peaceful Huangting (Huangting) of Tongye Continent and He Xiaoliang (He Xiaoliang) of the Shen’ao Sect were both praised as having unmatched fortune in the continent. Yet compared to Li Huai, who had unrivaled luck, the latter seemed even more incomprehensible. Huangting and He Xiaoliang still needed to consider how to stabilize their fortunes to avoid the intertwining of blessings and misfortunes, while was it necessary for Li Huai? He was the type who had fortune actively seeking him out, perhaps even worrying that things might become a bit heavy or unwieldy. 

Thus, Old Yang could exceptionally give Li Huai more, and it didn’t have to involve business dealings, for the old man genuinely liked the little rascal. 

In the Li Zhu Cave (Li Zhu Dong Tian), the passage of time was slow, and those who could enter the Yang family apothecary courtyard were already rare. A child like Li Huai was even more unusual. 

As for the woman, it was precisely because she was too ordinary and mediocre that the old man couldn’t be bothered to argue; otherwise, would someone like Xie Shi from Taoye Alley or Cao Xi from Mud Bottle Lane have been able to leave the Li Zhu Cave? 

Old Yang was silent for a moment, “Chen Ping’an has started investigating the matter of the lifelong porcelain discreetly, without leaving a trace.” 

Li Liu felt little impact from this; she was somewhat aware of the underlying complexities, which were a tangled web of relationships atop the mountain. The Yang family apothecary could not be separated from it, but they followed the rules and did not target Chen Ping’an specifically; they merely shared the spoils with the Great Li Song Clan (Da Li Song Shi). The creation of lifelong porcelain was initially the handiwork of Old Yang, and one could say that the rise of the Great Li Dynasty was due to this transaction with the Li Zhu Cave, which allowed it to prosper and gradually rise. Hence, Old Yang’s praise for the young Chen Zhan regarding the path of the soul was the highest recognition in the world. Aside from Old Yang, the only other person who could claim such mastery was Cui Zhan (Cui Dongshan). 

The Ma couple, who lived in Apricot Blossom Lane and had the ability to control the dragon kiln, were also deeply involved in the issue of Chen Ping’an’s lifelong porcelain. The old woman, Ma Lanhua, who had risen from being a river woman to a river deity but had never had a golden statue or temple nor any incense offerings, was particularly malicious, yet she had a conscience in this matter and even tried to stop her son and daughter-in-law. However, the couple was blinded by greed, and the old woman failed. Ma Ku Xuan had once awakened in the middle of the night to learn a bit of the truth, which is why he paid special attention to Chen Ping’an, the early on who had always pretended to be foolish. 

That Great Li Empress, the current queen, and the previous emperor did this for Song Jixin (Song Jixin) and for the sake of the Great Li’s future. 

The National Master Cui Zhan acted accordingly, playing a game with Qi Jingchun; if one were to only look at the outcome, Cui Zhan indeed played a divine hand. 

As for who exactly purchased Chen Ping’an’s lifelong porcelain back then and why it was shattered, how much immortal money the Great Li Song Clan compensated the behind-the-scenes buyer, Li Liu was not too clear and did not wish to delve into these matters that were none of her concern. Generally speaking, a child born in Mud Bottle Lane would not have a low price for the porcelain buyer because there had once been a sword immortal, Cao Xi, who had overseen a mighty tower in South Po Sha Continent, which added a premium. Yet it wouldn't be too high, as Mud Bottle Lane had already had a Cao Xi. 

Thus, the previous Great Li Emperor and the Great Li court, as well as the porcelain buyer, probably didn’t take it too seriously back then. However, as Chen Ping’an steadily progressed to today, it could no longer be said lightly; the other party might be unable to resist bringing up old grievances, searching for various reasons to negotiate thoroughly with the new emperor of Great Li. After all, according to common sense, if Chen Ping’an’s lifelong porcelain had shattered and he still achieved today’s glory, had it not shattered and been taken out of the Li Zhu Cave for focused cultivation, wouldn’t he have been a guaranteed fifth realm cultivator? Thus, the compensation from the Great Li court back then was destined to be unjust. 

Of course, if the buyer were an immortal from the Baoping Continent, they probably wouldn't dare to speak out now but would only grumble internally. However, if it were an immortal from another continent, especially those enormous sects from the Northern Ji Lu Continent, the new emperor of Great Li, whose foundation was not yet solid, would have to repay his father's debts. 

Li Liu suddenly said, “Chen Ping’an is someone easy to talk to.” 

Li Liu added, “However, Chen Ping’an is also a very formidable person.” 

Old Yang smiled, “Being evaluated like this by you means Chen Ping’an has certainly been no fool over the years.” 

Li Liu frowned, “Once Chen Ping’an figures out the ins and outs, his first enemy will be very close to Fallen Mountain and Mud Bottle Lane.” 

The first would be the Ma family of Apricot Blossom Lane. 

The second would be the royal family of the Great Li Song Clan. 

And Ma Ku Xuan was clearly a bet the old man valued greatly. 

Old Yang sneered, “If Ma Ku Xuan could be killed by a peer who merely had a lifelong porcelain broken, then I should thank Chen Ping’an for saving me a future bet.” 

Li Liu sighed. 

This was the old man’s business acumen. 

Old Yang chuckled, “That Daoist master actually spoke many great truths back then; it’s just that I don’t know if Chen Ping’an has realized them. For instance, one who does good deeds is not necessarily a good person. One who does bad deeds is not necessarily a bad person.” 

Old Yang looked up at the sky, “Do you know why the Buddhist sect seems to care little for the survival and trends of the Li Zhu Cave?” 

Li Liu remained silent. 

Old Yang answered his own question, “If the end of the Dharma age were to come, who do you think would suffer the most among the three teachings and myriad schools?” 

Li Liu replied, “The Daoists. Once there is no path to ascend, and without spiritual energy, all methods of cultivation in the world would become dragon-slaying techniques. The Daoists would find themselves in the most difficult position. The lofty and distant Dao could easily turn into a state of inaction. This is likely to be the earliest occurrence of the division between heaven and earth and the deities. In contrast, Confucianism and Buddhism could still pass on their teachings for thousands of years; it’s merely that their light has dimmed significantly.” 

Old Yang nodded, “That’s why Dao Lao Da has been in a hurry. Dao Lao San personally protected the grandmaster and took a trip to the Li Zhu Cave, acting as a fortune teller, keeping a close eye on Qi Jingchun.” 

Li Liu asked, “Why doesn’t Qi Jingchun use the hairpin gifted by his own master?” 

Old Yang replied, “That’s the crucial item of the foul-nosed old temple master. The old scholar certainly meant well, as I didn’t even notice the origin of that hairpin at first. Qi Jingchun likely didn’t realize it at first either. Later, when Qi Jingchun bore the heavenly tribulation, the oddity of that hairpin slowly revealed itself. The foul-nosed old man certainly had some malicious intentions towards the Dao Ancestor. It’s just that Qi Jingchun was unwilling to fall from one chessboard into another; he would rather die than let all the threads be severed.” 

Old Yang revealed a hint of nostalgia, “Back then, it was this kind of person who turned our world upside down.” 

The old man laughed, “Don’t think that today’s world is utterly chaotic; there will still be many such people stepping forward when disaster strikes. That’s the merit of Confucian teaching. Those who love to say the common folks are foolish are the mountain people or the scholars. In fact, to do good without knowing what good is, and to do evil while knowing it’s evil, that’s where Confucianism’s greatest strength lies. Parents raise children; children support parents. Rulers and ministers, teachers and students, friends and relatives, neighbors—Confucianism’s world is like porcelain making, its teaching permeates the heavens and earth, the most adhesive, though porcelain is fragile, the nature of clay will never disappear.” 

Old Yang pondered, “Earlier, Li Huai sent some books to the shop; I came across one line, ‘Cold winds enter the bones, while grass and trees grow weak and thin.’ How’s that? Isn’t it quite meaningful? Why would the likes of Ma Lanhua from Apricot Blossom Lane obstruct her son and daughter-in-law from seeking fortune and doing evil? This is the complexity of human nature, the rules of Confucianism binding the hearts of men beyond the paper; many truths have long existed in the hearts of the people in this vast world.” 

Li Liu curiously asked, “What was Qi Jingchun studying during his sixty years in the Li Zhu Cave?” 

Old Yang replied, “Naturally, he observed all the teachings and myriad schools, and Qi Jingchun’s reading truly deserves the praise of ‘seeing it all at a glance.’ However, he focused on three critical studies: techniques, pathways, and laws.” 

Li Liu sighed. 

A mere scholar, why bother? 

Old Yang pulled out some tobacco. 

Li Liu smiled knowingly at this scene. 

It must have been given to the old man by her brother, for it was clear that such tobacco looked cheap. 

After a casual chat, 

Li Liu stood up, fleetingly changing her mind to visit Shenhui Mountain first before heading to Fallen Mountain. 

Shenhui Mountain (Shenhui Shan) had sheer cliffs, with the words “Heaven Opens, Divine Show” written in large characters. 

A young woman in a green dress with a ponytail sat atop the first horizontal stroke of the “Heaven” character, overlooking the mortal world below. 

She was slowly enjoying some pastries. 

When Li Liu appeared beside her, Ruan Xiu (Ruan Xiu) still didn’t turn her head. 

Li Liu crouched down, gazing into the distance, casually tossing the two items over. 

Ruan Xiu caught them in one swift motion and tucked away her pastry napkin. 

Li Liu spoke, “One cave, Water Field Cave (Shuitian Dongtian). One blessed land, Misty Clouds Blessed Land (Yunxia Fudi). Compared to the ten major caves and thirty-six minor caves, it’s slightly lacking, but the blessed land is a ready-made medium blessed land. It’s neither good nor bad; with some investment, there’s hope it could rise to a superior blessed land. It’s just that there’s no one inside—only mountain and marsh spirits, grass and flower spirits. Because the old man doesn’t enjoy dealing with people, you should know. According to our agreement, in the future, the old man will have you do two things, after which you can decide for yourself whether to do them and how to do them.” 

Ruan Xiu opened her hand, looking down. 

One jade tablet, inscribed with the words “It’s not the Azure Dragon who governs the water, but Lu who shapes the ravines and fields,” referring to the Water Field Cave, also known as the Green Seedling Cave (Qingyang Dongtian). 

One seal, engraved with “Time promotes the world, while mist and clouds abound in this place,” referring to the Misty Clouds Blessed Land. 

Blessed lands are earthly, and their treasures are heavenly; caves are for cultivation and enlightenment. 

This is the literal meaning of “a world apart.” 

Of course, the best situation would be for a sect to possess both a cave and a blessed land, such as the Shen’ao Sect that has a Clear Pool Blessed Land alongside a small cave. However, it does not belong to the thirty-six major or the Li Zhu Cave or Dragon Palace Cave; its quality is insufficient. But a small cave is still a small cave, and compared to an ordinary place rich in spiritual energy, aside from having more spiritual energy, the key is that it offers many mysteries, such as traces of the Great Dao and golden treasures that have been washed and shaped by the passage of time, shining brightly in the room. 

The Water Field Cave also has some enchanting mirages, making it quite suitable for Liu Xianyang’s dream sword practice. 

Actually, the old man had an even more suitable cave blessed land for that sword manual. 

But it wasn’t appropriate to bring it out just yet. 

When dealing with others, never offer them something without a price, or else you won’t sell it for a high price. 

Ruan Xiu frowned and asked, “Is there no fire element fragment secret realm?” 

Li Liu replied, “Even if the old man had one, he wouldn’t give it to you. If you dared to accept it, your father would send it back. I certainly wouldn’t make an extra trip over such a matter.” 

Ruan Xiu nodded, “Thank you.” 

Li Liu did not respond. 

Ruan Xiu took out the wrapped pastry again, “Do you want to eat?” 

Li Liu hesitated for a moment, picked up a piece of pastry, and put it in her mouth. 

Ruan Xiu smiled, looking pleased, then said, “You can eat once more before I kill you next time.” 

Li Liu laughed, “I eat the pastries, and you eat me; it’s still you eating—what a good deal.” 

Ruan Xiu put away the pastries and smiled at the distance, “But it’s also possible that you’ll eat me. I think that’s quite nice; there are no restrictions, just eat when you want.” 

Boiling water, burning rivers, and cooking seas, everything can be consumed. 

Ruan Xiu asked, “I can’t remember the past; who won or lost the last time we fought?” 

Li Liu responded indifferently, “We both lost.” 

Li Liu asked, “As for the twelve named disciples of the Dragon Spring Sword Sect, clearly, some of them were pieces inserted by others; why did you deliberately ignore them?” 

Ruan Xiu looked puzzled, “If others put a few small ants in the chicken coop, do I need to manage that?” 

Li Liu laughed. 

Poor ants. 

Among them, Xie Ling was probably the most pitiful. 

Ruan Xiu casually asked, “Did you not run into acquaintances in the Northern Ji Lu Continent?” 

Li Liu replied, “I crossed paths with someone in a place called Ghost Trap Valley (Guijue Gu); I didn’t deliberately greet them. Anyway, I’ll meet them again at Lion Peak (Shizi Feng).” 

Ruan Xiu exclaimed, “Then you don’t know how to socialize.” 

Li Liu coldly smirked, “Want to go to that Misty Clouds Blessed Land for a fight?” 

“Not going; it’s obvious I’ll lose. It’s just a losing business, and fighting back and forth would only scatter the spiritual energy of the blessed land and cause casualties among the great demons—what’s the point?” 

Ruan Xiu shook her head, “With your temper, the fact that I didn’t kill you back then shows that my temper was genuinely good.” 

Li Liu leaned back, resting her hands behind her head, “That was exceptionally good.” 

Ruan Xiu glanced at the sky, noticing two people riding the wind, heading south. 

She took a look and then stopped paying attention. 

(End of chapter)

 ### Chapter 627: His Life's Destiny and His Disciples (Part Two)

A man arrived at the Niujiao Mountain ferry aboard his own boat, accompanied by a maid named Yaa. The two soared on the wind directly towards Ruin Mountain.

He wore a sword badge crafted by the Longquan Sword Sect, which he had acquired during his last visit to Ruin Mountain, purchasing it from a nearby immortal’s residence. It now hung from his waist.

Relying on his status to engage in straightforward transactions was something he could not bring himself to do—not for moral reasons, but simply because he couldn’t bear the thought of paying double the price and then watching the seller happily agree to a lower offer. Even so, it was merely a single Gu Yu coin.

Upon reaching the foot of the mountain, he landed gracefully and called out, “Brother Zheng Da Feng!”

A hunchbacked man basking in the sun on a bench at the gate immediately sprang to his feet and ran over, greeting him warmly, “Oh, Brother Zhou Fei is here!”

Standing beside Jiang Shangzhen was a stunning young woman, Yaa, who had been brought out from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land. Upon seeing her, Zheng Da Feng sighed, “What a shame.”

Jiang Shangzhen asked, “Can we go up the mountain?”

Zheng Da Feng nodded, “Of course! However, our Ruin Mountain has been a bit tight on funds lately, so we implemented a new mountain rule: anyone who wishes to ascend must pay a small fee. But since it’s you, Brother Zhou Fei, I’ll make an exception and let it slide this time. Just keep an eye on things, considering your status. You’re practically one of our own now, almost like a half-fostered disciple.”

Jiang Shangzhen chuckled and pulled out a Gu Yu coin, placing it in Zheng Da Feng’s hand.

Zheng Da Feng quickly tucked it away, “No, no, this is too much!”

Yaa looked at the shameless hunchback and felt a bit perplexed; her sharp mind struggled to comprehend the situation.

Zheng Da Feng accompanied Jiang Shangzhen up the mountain and asked, “What brings you here this time?”

Jiang Shangzhen replied with a smile, “I’m here to express my gratitude to Ruin Mountain. We now have a new sword cultivator of the Jade Purity realm appointed as a worshipper at Shujian Lake, thanks to your mountain lord. I also heard that Wei Shan Shen is hosting the second night banquet; I missed the previous two and feel quite bad about it. So, I must pay a visit. One is to give thanks, and the other is to apologize. I must make up for it.”

A new sect named Zhenjing Sect had emerged at Shujian Lake, a widely recognized event across the Baoping Continent.

If not for the clamor of hoofbeats across the continent, this would have been a topic of endless discussion among the mountain cultivators for quite some time.

Zhenjing Sect was now the subordinate sect of the top immortal sect, Yuguizong, on Tongye Island.

The chief worshipper, Liu Laocheng, was the only wild cultivator of the upper five realms in Baoping Continent.

In addition, there were other worshippers, including Liu Zhimao from Qingxia Island and a group of powerful cultivators from Yuguizong who had come to settle at Shujian Lake.

Now, they also had a female sword immortal from Beijulu Island, Li Cai, who became a registered worshipper of the sect.

The momentum was overwhelming.

As a result, more and more gazes from across Baoping Continent turned towards the Shengaos Sect, curious if there would be a clash between the top dogs and rising stars. If there were undercurrents stirring beneath the surface, it would be less exciting than a full-fledged battle between major cultivators.

The Shengaos Sect's leader, Qi Zhen, was a Celestial Lord of the twelfth realm and had received a divine weapon from the headmaster of the Dao lineage. The Shengaos Sect also had a strong backing in the Central Divine Continent. Qi Zhen's junior brother seemed to hold a significant position within the upper sect.

However, according to the estimations of Baoping cultivators, Zhenjing Sect would still exercise caution and expand its territory carefully over the next century.

The Great Li’s Song clan would not allow a burgeoning sect to sprout from thin air in Baoping Continent.

In fact, Zhenjing Sect had indeed adhered to the rules; even when dealing with the many islands around Shujian Lake, aside from the early bloody iron fist approach typical of “the obedient prosper, while the disobedient perish,” things had become relatively stable and mild. Some sufficiently clever cultivators and islands had enjoyed gains, discovering that after Liu Zhimao’s restructuring, if not for the restrictions of sect rules, their individual island strengths and assets had only increased. Interestingly, the most chaotic and mixed wild cultivator area in Baoping Continent seemed to have transformed overnight into a realm of recognized immortal masters, each affiliated with a sect.

During this period, Zhu Chai Island attempted to migrate out of Shujian Lake, and Zhenjing Sect specifically designated a series of picturesque islands, yet the ownership remained undecided. The sudden retreat of a major cultivator from Zhenjing Sect was trivial.

Zhu Lian welcomed Jiang Shangzhen and engaged in pleasant conversation. Jiang Shangzhen presented two invaluable treasures as gifts to make up for the two missed night banquets, requesting Zhu Lian to pass them on to Wei Ban from Piyun Mountain.

In addition, Jiang Shangzhen had initially prepared two more treasured items to express gratitude for Ruin Mountain’s young mountain lord bringing in a Jade Purity realm worshipper for Zhenjing Sect.

Zhu Lian remarked that a Jade Purity realm sword cultivator was indeed a sword immortal, especially one from Beijulu Island. Offering just two items was not enough; three would be more reasonable.

Sitting on a stone bench in the small courtyard, Jiang Shangzhen slapped his thigh, exclaiming that he had forgotten about this detail, feeling guilty. He then directly produced... two more items.

Yaa couldn’t bear to look.

Having left the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, she had witnessed Jiang Shangzhen’s seemingly overbearing yet calculated methods within Yuguizong. She had also followed Jiang Shangzhen to the Yunkong Blessed Land and seen his ruthlessness, as he would kill those who resisted like snapping the necks of a few chicks without batting an eye. By the time they reached Shujian Lake, although Jiang Shangzhen had never issued explicit commands, he acted like an indifferent landlord with no care for the world. However, everyone and everything reflected the invisible mark of Jiang Shangzhen’s way of dealing with the world.

Thus, she found it increasingly strange why that young immortal from years ago, surnamed Chen, warranted such a serious demeanor from Jiang Shangzhen. Moreover, Chen Ping’an was not even on his own mountain now.

Now, Yaa was no longer the frog at the bottom of the well from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.

She had witnessed the vistas from the highest peak of Tongye Island.

Zheng Da Feng noticed Zhu Lian’s gaze and smiled, “The expert I invited should be arriving soon. He can help us negotiate with Jiang Shangzhen.”

Just then, a young woman floated down into the small courtyard.

Zheng Da Feng grinned, “Xiao Liutiao, you’ve really blossomed beautifully; you’re stunning!”

Li Liu smiled, “Hello, Uncle Zheng.”

Zhu Lian didn’t engage in any pleasantries and immediately dove into discussing the matters of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land with the unfamiliar young woman. He spoke in detail about the dynamics of the four nations while Zheng Da Feng kept the gate.

Li Liu didn’t keep him in suspense and summoned Wei Ban, opening the Tongye umbrella, allowing Zhu Lian to step into the former Lotus Flower Blessed Land.

A far-traveling realm warrior and a casually-dominating Nascent Spirit realm major cultivator looked out over the landscape of the blessed land together.

Li Liu tugged at her lips, “No wonder the notorious Daoist has grown so much; it’s no surprise he dares to challenge the heavens in the Qingming realm.”

Zhu Lian sat cross-legged, feigning indifference.

Li Liu pointed at the vast mountains and rivers below, slowly saying, “According to the old saying, this blessed land has undergone a transformation known as ‘the mountains and rivers change colors.’ The territories outside the South Garden Kingdom were crafted by your former heavenly master using great divine powers, resembling a white paper blessed land in form and an incense cave in spirit. In short, all the mountains, rivers, grasses, and beings outside the South Garden Kingdom are like white paper; they can live but lack any ‘meaning.’ That is to say, no matter how sincere these paper beings are in their prayers, they cannot cultivate any incense essence. However, they do not hinder their reincarnation in the new blessed land. As long as the new blessed land’s spiritual energy grows, the South Garden Kingdom’s incense flourishes, all these paper beings will thicken and eventually become indistinguishable from ordinary people, potentially becoming cultivators or even mountain deities.”

Zhu Lian replied coolly, “From a splendid painting to a meticulous sketch.”

Li Liu chuckled, “That’s one way to put it.”

Li Liu focused her gaze, casually pointing out several places, “The so-called fallen immortals have already withdrawn from this fractured blessed land. Moreover, some cultivators who have begun their ascent clearly are no longer in your Lotus Flower Blessed Land. For instance, the Hushan Sect, which once had Yu Zhenyi stationed there, will show a particularly blank landscape, strikingly evident; this is the result of Yu Zhenyi being chosen by the old Daoist. Yu Zhenyi should now be among the four authentic Lotus Flower Blessed Lands, while Luchai is another. As for the scholarly family in the South Garden Kingdom’s capital, it’s also particularly blank, extremely conspicuous. This must mean that this family has produced someone interesting in the eyes of the old Daoist. So after the division of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land into four, the affiliations should be quite clear: Chen Ping’an, Yu Zhenyi, the first in history to successfully transition to cultivation in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, the fallen immortal Luchai who unified the demonic sect, and the family that Chen Ping’an visited the library twice.”

Zhu Lian didn’t even glance, scratching his head and smiling, “I’m not a deity of mountains and rivers; I can’t perceive those natural phenomena.”

Li Liu laughed lightly, “No need to probe me; it’s unnecessary, and be careful not to overdo it.”

Zhu Lian smiled, “Alright.”

Li Liu asked, “If you’re the piece in that notorious Daoist’s game, Chen Ping’an will suffer greatly.”

Zhu Lian braced his fists on his knees, the wind blowing through, slightly leaning forward, “Since we are fortunate to be born as humans, we should speak human words and do human deeds; otherwise, what’s the point of wandering this world?”

Zhu Lian squinted, slowly saying, “Heaven and earth gave birth to me, Zhu Lian; I cannot refuse. How I, Zhu Lian, choose to die is up to me.”

Li Liu turned her head, scrutinizing this purely martial man adorned with a veil for the first time, “Zhu Lian, your path has potential.”

Zhu Lian raised his head, turning to the extremely dangerous young woman, “Miss Liu, it’s a pity you don’t come to Ruin Mountain.”

Li Liu looked puzzled but was too lazy to seek answers, continuing to explain the key points and taboos of the blessed land’s operations to Zhu Lian, as knowledgeable as Jiang Shangzhen.

The reason was simple.

Historically, even excluding the earliest roots of the Great Dao, Li Liu had managed several caves and blessed lands, including the Ripple Cave in the Central Divine Continent and the Bi Tide Blessed Land in Liuxia Island. At one point, they were even ranked among the thirty-six and seventy-two blessed lands, but their fates turned out to be far worse than that of the fallen Pearl Cave, now shattered and forgotten.

Pei Qian had been in seclusion for several days.

Day and night, she focused on one task.

In the bamboo building, she diligently copied texts at the desk on the first floor.

She couldn’t rush it.

She could only write one character at a time, carefully and correctly.

As the small steward of the mountain, the little girl Chen Ruchu was wholeheartedly trying to take on the role of Ruin Mountain’s bamboo building’s right guardian, serving Pei Qian by fetching tea, water, and giving her shoulder rubs.

Finally, at noon one day, Pei Qian gently set down her pen, stood up, and took a deep breath, striking a pose of gathering energy, “I have succeeded!”

Chen Ruchu asked, “You really finished copying?”

Pei Qian shot her a sideways glance, “Not only did I pay off my debts, but I also copied an extra ten days’ worth of material like Baoping sister.”

Pei Qian crossed her arms, coldly sneering, “Starting tomorrow, when I practice my punches, Senior Brother Cui will know that a Pei Qian with a focused mind is definitely not a Pei Qian he can casually criticize.”

Chen Ruchu hesitated to speak.

Forget it; after all, it was all about a punch.

She decided not to pour cold water on it.

Zhou Mili quickly raised her hands and clapped enthusiastically.

Pei Qian leaned over the mountain of paper, playing with a few family heirlooms. After packing them away, she walked around the desk, saying she wanted to take them out for some fresh air.

Chen Ruchu grabbed a handful of sunflower seeds, while Zhou Mili carried a walking stick.

Pei Qian swaggered towards the old chef’s house, intending to find the little master whom her master had tricked over from Beijulu.

However, she found no one at home.

Pei Qian then went to find the old chef.

On her way, a stray dog suddenly darted out. Pei Qian leaped forward, pressing the dog’s head to the ground with one hand, gripping its mouth with the other, twisting it skillfully, causing its head to tilt.

Pei Qian squatted down and asked, “Are you rebelling? You’ve been gone for so long without showing your face? Speak! Give me a reason to spare you!”

The dog could only whimper.

With a twist, Pei Qian praised, “Good courage! Facing a master who can kill like it’s child’s play, you can remain silent—this heroism alone can save your life.”

The dog quickly wagged its tail.

But Pei Qian didn’t let it off so easily, “You can avoid the death penalty, but you can’t escape the living punishment.”

She lifted one hand, and Zhou Mili immediately handed over the walking stick. When hitting dogs, one must use a dog stick; it was particularly effective when poking beehives, as Pei Qian often said, but now she said impatiently, “Seeds.”

The little girl quickly placed some sunflower seeds in Pei Qian’s hand. Pei Qian cracked the seeds with one hand while still holding the dog’s mouth with the other, “Now, learn to smile coldly like those masters in the books.”

The dog managed to pull a face.

Pei Qian added, “Now try to imitate the villains from the martial world novels and give me a charming smile.”

The dog changed its expression again.

Pei Qian frowned, sensing the dog was in trouble, and it started to struggle.

Yet Pei Qian held onto the dog, stood up, spun around, and flung the dog seven or eight feet away.

Then, while cracking seeds, she noticed a man and a young woman standing not far away.

Tilting her head and looking for a long while, she suddenly beamed with a wide smile and bowed.

Chen Ruchu bent down and called out, “Mr. Zhou!”

Zhou Mili followed suit.

“This should be our second meeting, right?” Jiang Shangzhen looked at the little charcoal girl he had found interesting back then, smiling, “So you’ve become Chen Ping’an’s first disciple? That’s great; I think Chen Ping’an has a good eye to take you out of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.”

Pei Qian nodded vigorously like a chick pecking at rice.

This guy really had no patience for flattery.

However, being recognized by her master felt like a blessing from her ancestors, so Pei Qian smiled, “Have you been to the mountain god temple at our peak?”

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, “I have.”

Pei Qian then asked, “What about the city god’s temple in Longzhou?”

The little incense figure at the city god’s temple had become her half-little minion, as it had led her to that big hornet’s nest earlier, and she had rewarded it with a copper coin. They had known each other long before the city god had come to take office, and Baoping sister had been there too. However, in recent times, that little follower had hardly appeared.

So, whenever she had the chance, she wanted to add some incense offerings for the city god.

Jiang Shangzhen shook his head, “I haven’t been there.”

After bidding farewell to Jiang Shangzhen, Pei Qian took the two of them to the top of the steps to sit together.

The girl brought to the mountain by Zhu Lian, Cen Yuji, was just coming up the mountain from halfway down, practicing her punches.

According to the gossip from the little girl in the pink skirt, Cen Yuji had to make three round trips from the foot to the peak of the mountain in one day.

The three girls sat side by side, cracking seeds and whispering.

Jiang Shangzhen returned to his courtyard, shaking his head and smiling, “Now I understand why the gentleman from South Pozao has his moon stolen from his shoulder. I guess the Lotus Flower Blessed Land was also plucked by the old Daoist, who extracted the essence and placed it in this little girl’s other eye.”

Yaa listened, shocked.

Jiang Shangzhen glanced at her, “Isn’t it frustrating to work so hard on your cultivation, only to feel you can never match someone else’s chance?”

Yaa didn’t dare to speak.

Jiang Shangzhen smiled and took out a semi-immortal weapon from Zhenjing Sect, “I sincerely gift this to you. Can you handle it? You won’t die, will you? Yes, you will, and you won’t even know how. Was it Liu Laocheng? Or Liu Zhimao? Or those worshippers from Yuguizong? Just a little scheme, and you’ll bite the bait, leading to your demise.”

Yaa silently awaited Jiang Shangzhen to retract the semi-immortal weapon.

However, Jiang Shangzhen clenched the orb tightly and struck it into the girl’s forehead with a smile, “This is a gift. So you don’t think that just by hugging a big leg, you can cultivate in peace. In a place surrounded by tigers and wolves, you can’t remain as naive as you were in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.”

Yaa felt like she was in a boiling oil pot, her spirit boiling, clutching her head in pain, rolling on the ground.

Jiang Shangzhen had already waved his sleeve to create a small world.

“I want to use you to fish for Liu Laocheng and Liu Zhimao’s personalities; being born from the wild, they have great ambitions and love freedom, which I understand. If they can endure, one should ascend to the immortal realm, and the other should break through the Nascent Spirit bottleneck to join me, Jiang Shangzhen, in enjoying the scenery. If they can’t hold out, even if their hearts waver slightly, I’ll be very heartbroken; Zhenjing Sect will lose two key generals for nothing.”

Jiang Shangzhen crossed his legs, sitting aside, pouring himself a cup of tea, “In this world, almost no cultivator realizes that only one’s own character can truly be the protector that accompanies them through life.”

---

In a shabby alley of the South Garden Kingdom’s capital, a young man in a green shirt sat on a long-unmoved bench, deep in thought.

Mr. Lu had left years ago, saying that if there’s an opportunity in the future, they could reunite outside, but don’t think about it in this world.

At that time, Mr. Lu was undoubtedly the second most powerful figure in the world, nearly equal to the youthful immortal Yu Zhenyi of the Hushan Sect, who traveled far and wide on his sword.

Not only that, the Northern Jin Kingdom had launched a campaign against the grasslands under the command of General Tang Tieyi, achieving remarkable military prowess. Afterward, Tang Tieyi and the Northern Jin army ceased their large-scale operations, leaving the grasslands to descend into infighting.

Moreover, Tang Tieyi had repeatedly ventured north alone, using a single saber to slay numerous masters from the grasslands.

For reasons unknown, the Saint Cheng Yuanshan had abandoned all his wealth from the grasslands after his journey to the South Garden Kingdom, joining the Hushan Sect.

Meanwhile, the Southern Wind Kingdom was aggressively searching for suitable cultivators under the puppet emperor propped up by the Hushan Sect.

The Bird’s Eye Peak of Lu Fang and the Chun Tide Palace of Zhou Shi had remained closed to the public.

However, the young man in the green shirt merely observed all these worldly changes quietly, spending more time reading and cultivating.

Mr. Zhong Qiu and Mr. Lu had each accompanied him on a journey to the five peaks of the South Garden Kingdom.

It was both a long journey and a path of cultivation.

At that time, the young man had that book, the True Form of the Five Peaks. After Mr. Zhong Qiu acquired that immortal item, fearing it would be taken away by Yu Zhenyi, he had tried to destroy it but failed. Later, for reasons unknown, Mr. Lu persuaded him to hand the book over to Cao Qinglang for safekeeping. Cao Qinglang had roughly guessed some of the underlying motives, realizing that Mr. Lu targeted Yu Zhenyi not just for himself but also for this enigmatic immortal book.

The two teachers imparted knowledge to Cao Qinglang, albeit with differing approaches.

Mr. Zhong Qiu’s teachings followed a gradual and gentle path, emphasizing etiquette and propriety. After all, Zhong Qiu was recognized as a literary sage and martial master.

In contrast, Mr. Lu’s teachings were diverse and profound, and he had risen to prominence in the world at an unprecedented speed. All his disciples had become formidable figures in their own right.

A knock echoed through the air.

Cao Qinglang went to open the door.

It was an old Confucian scholar with graying temples.

The national master of the South Garden Kingdom.

Zhong Qiu and half of his disciple, Cao Qinglang, took their seats.

Zhong Qiu smiled, “Qinglang, you had many questions as a youth, asking about the origins of stars, the rotations of the sun and moon, and the roots of wind and rain. As your teacher, I couldn’t answer them, but now you can pursue those answers yourself.”

Cao Qinglang nodded gently.

Zhong Qiu fell silent for a moment, reflecting, “However, I hope that in the future, you can speak on behalf of this world, so as not to become merely a pawn in everyone’s game.”

Cao Qinglang replied, “I will. This is somewhat related to my future capabilities, but it’s not important. What matters is I believe in him.”

Zhong Qiu chuckled, “Then I am at ease.”

He felt reassured regarding the young man he had watched grow year after year, as well as the young man in white who had once carried a sword.

Zhong Qiu suddenly hesitated.

Cao Qinglang asked, “Are you hesitating about staying in the South Garden Kingdom or heading to that world?”

Zhong Qiu nodded, “I’m not curious about how vast the world outside is; I just long for the wisdom of the sages out there.”

Cao Qinglang smiled brightly, “Don’t worry, sir; he once said that the books outside aren’t too expensive.”

Zhong Qiu teased, “How old were you then? You remember everything he said clearly.”

Cao Qinglang muttered, “How could I forget? I won’t forget.”

Both fell silent.

Zhong Qiu looked up at the sky, “It’s going to rain.”

Cao Qinglang smiled, “The road remains; we’ll just need an umbrella.”

Mr. Yuweng, Wu Shouwen, had taken his disciple Zhao Luanluan and her brother Zhao Shuxia to leave Yanzhi County, embarking on a journey across mountains and rivers.

After all, the matters on Penglang Mountain were too significant. Wu Shouwen didn’t distrust Chen Ping’an; he was merely cautious, as caution is the best ship for a long voyage. Thus, they traveled far and left the colorful garment kingdom.

They first visited the Shushui Kingdom, paying a visit to the sword saint Song Yusheng.

The two had a pleasant conversation but didn’t become overly familiar.

There’s no guarantee that friends of friends can become close friends, as it depends on fate.

However, Song Yusheng was fond of the two young disciples, especially since her daughter-in-law, who now managed the family business, took a particular liking to the blind girl Zhao Luanlu, recognizing her as a girl with potential for cultivation, which likely stemmed from her own lack of children, leading her to take pity on the innocent yet unfortunate girl.

The three—old, young, and younger—began their journey back north.

The further south they went, the less stable things became.

Wu Shouwen didn’t dare to gamble with the lives of the two children.

On this day, the three camped on a mountain peak, with Zhao Luanlu practicing her breathing exercises and Zhao Shuxia practicing his stances.

Wu Shouwen felt a sense of relief watching them.

Luanlu naturally had better aptitude, but the elder treated both children equally.

Wu Shouwen was carrying a manual that Chen Ping’an had painstakingly copied word for word, along with a replica sword strapped to his back, without mentioning it to Zhao Shuxia.

According to his agreement with Chen Ping’an, Wu Shouwen could only hand over these two items once Zhao Shuxia had made progress in his martial training.

After Zhao Shuxia practiced, he stood still, gazing into the distance.

In Yanzhi County, during his long-awaited reunion with Mr. Chen, Zhao Shuxia had initially practiced over 160,000 punches. Later, just before their separation, Mr. Chen had urged him to reach 500,000.

Zhao Shuxia knew his aptitude wasn’t great, so he devoted himself to training, believing diligence could make up for his shortcomings.

Unbeknownst to him, Zhao Luanlu had come to stand beside him, softly asking, “Brother, do you want to become Mr. Chen’s disciple?”

Zhao Shuxia scratched his head, feeling a bit shy, “I wouldn’t dare to dream.”

How could he, Zhao Shuxia, dare to hope to become a disciple of such a sword immortal like Chen Ping’an?

Zhao Luanlu whispered, “But I always feel that Mr. Chen has high hopes for you.”

Zhao Shuxia pondered, “Regardless of anything else, I must finish my 500,000 punches! We’ll see about the rest later.”

Zhao Luanlu nodded in agreement.

Suddenly, Zhao Shuxia sighed.

The girl looked puzzled, “What’s wrong?”

Zhao Shuxia said quietly, “I was just thinking, what if, by some stroke of luck, I became Mr. Chen’s disciple? What should I call you then? Mistress? Wouldn’t that make things confusing?”

The girl’s face flushed red, blooming like a peach blossom in spring.

She kicked Zhao Shuxia’s calf, “Zhao Shuxia! What nonsense are you talking about?!”

Zhao Shuxia looked innocently at her, grinning.

Wu Shouwen called out loudly, “I didn’t hear anything!”

The girl’s cheeks turned even redder as she ran off to be alone.

Zhao Shuxia turned his head and exchanged a knowing smile with the elder, a silent understanding passing between them.

Although there was an age gap, they were both men.

However, when Zhao Shuxia resumed his practice, it was different.

Wu Shouwen watched the young man practicing his punches, occasionally feeling a bit dazed, convinced that Zhao Shuxia’s aptitude might actually be quite good?

The Zhao Shuxia of the past certainly wasn’t a martial arts prodigy, and the current Zhao Shuxia’s understanding of martial intent was still very shallow; he wasn’t yet a martial genius.

However, one day, as long as the young man persevered on this path, at least there was a possibility.

The world’s martial intent recently focused on Chen Ping’an.

Only the nameless Zhao Shuxia remained.

On the border of the Qingluan Kingdom, the Glass Immortal was on the verge of a breakdown.

The white-clad youth, Master Cui, had a weak child carry him on his back.

The child stumbled as they walked along the rugged mountain path.

Cui Dongshan waved a snowy white sleeve, shouting “Giddyup, giddyup!” as if riding a horse.

In the bamboo building of Ruin Mountain, Pei Qian had just narrowly avoided a punch when another punch struck her forehead, pinning her against the wall.

The emotionless old man stated, “How many times have you died now? I’m using four realms of paper against your three realms, and you still couldn’t handle it? Are you a waste?! Your master is a waste with decent aptitude, and you’re just an unqualified disciple of Chen Ping’an!”

It felt like Pei Qian, stuck on the wall, was bleeding from all seven orifices. She struggled to open her eyes, spitting blood at the old man.

The old man didn’t even flinch. Instead, with one sudden punch, he increased the force, causing her small head to nearly dent into the wall if this bamboo building were a common structure.

The old man sneered, “Not convinced? Do you have the ability to speak? A disciple of a waste of a master! If I were Chen Ping’an, I would’ve kicked you out long ago to avoid embarrassment!”

This punch rendered Pei Qian’s face, already smeared with blood, devoid of any trace of color.

With a frail arm trembling, she didn’t even attempt to punch back; instead, she merely brushed against the old man’s shoulder.

A gentle touch—was she trying to tickle him?

The old man seemed furious, transforming his punch into a palm, seizing her entire head and casually swinging her away, sending her crashing against the wall before hitting the ground heavily.

Pei Qian had completely lost consciousness.

The old man approached her, crouching down, and extending his finger, pointing in mid-air.

After a moment, he stood up and turned to the corridor outside the bamboo building, saying, “Take her away.”

The bamboo door swung open, and the little girl in the pink skirt deftly hoisted the limp, dark-skinned girl onto her back, moving quickly and softly towards the first floor.

The old man walked out of the house, hands clasped behind his back, and reached the railing of the corridor.

Of course, he wasn’t merely feeding the girl punches with the usual four realms; that would be impossible.

The old man chuckled silently, gazing into the distance.

With that punch, you should have been the strongest in your realm, Pei Qian!

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 628: The Heaviness of the Mountain Summit's Fist**

Clad in a blue robe, Chen Ping'an journeyed upstream along a river that flowed into the sea. He did not deliberately walk along the riverbank to listen to the water or gaze at the surface; rather, he needed to carefully observe the local customs and the various deities of the mountains and waters along the way. Thus, he often took detours and did not travel too quickly.

Whenever he resolved to do something, he always applied himself diligently, considering it no hardship. However, those around him could rest easy. If they were young, they might even be oblivious to their own good fortune.

Perhaps due to his upbringing in the lower echelons of society, Chen Ping'an possessed great patience and resilience.

During his journey, he encountered a thought-provoking experience related to the mountains and waters.

One night, Chen Ping'an stayed at an inn near the City God Temple in the state of Fuhua (芙蕖). At the midnight hour, he heard the sound of drums and gongs, audible only to cultivators and spirits. The ethereal barriers suddenly parted, and, guided by various ghostly officials, spirits entered the city in an orderly manner. This was known as the City God Night Court, held twice a month, where the City God would judge the deeds of the spirits in his domain.

Chen Ping'an quietly left the inn and arrived outside the City God Temple. The two divine guardians stationed at the entrance to prevent the spirits from causing a commotion were not merely celestial masters; upon closer inspection, he immediately bowed and respectfully addressed them as “Master.” 

After returning the courtesy, Chen Ping'an inquired if he could observe the City God’s night court.

One of the divine guardians promptly turned to report. After receiving permission from the City God, the civil judge, and the officials of the yin-yang department, he invited Chen Ping'an to enter.

Inside the main hall, the City God sat prominently at the head of the table, with the civil and military judges and various officials arranged in an orderly manner, judging and punishing numerous spirits. If any spirit protested and was not among the particularly heinous, they were allowed to appeal to the nearby Mountain Lord or Water Lord, who would send officials to re-examine the cases.

Chen Ping'an chose not to sit in the chair specially brought for him by the City God. Instead, he placed it behind a red lacquered pillar and quietly sat there, closing his eyes to rest.

When a spirit loudly declared its grievances and protested the judgment, Chen Ping'an finally opened his eyes and listened attentively to the City God’s rebuttal.

It turned out that the spirit had been a Confucian student without any official title in life. While digging outside the city, he inadvertently unearthed a large number of bones and took great care to give them a proper burial. The spirit believed this was a significant contribution and questioned why the officials of the City God Temple ignored it. He argued that this should offset his own transgressions, claiming it was a gross injustice, and he insisted on appealing to the Water Lord. If he was ignored there, he would risk losing the chance of reincarnation just to sound the drum of grievance and appeal to the Mountain Lord of the Fuhua state, seeking justice against the negligence of the City God.

The City God reprimanded him, “In the world, the City God investigates the affairs of the living; your actions in life, regardless of good intentions, will receive no reward. Likewise, ill intentions will not incur punishment! Even if you strike the grievance drum at the Mountain Lord or Water Lord, the judgment tonight will not change!”

The spirit sat down in dejection.

At the end of the hour, just before dawn, the night court concluded.

Chen Ping'an then stood up, walked around the pillar, and expressed his gratitude to the City God dressed in black and white, before taking his leave.

The City God personally escorted him to the temple's entrance.

At the door, the City God hesitated for a moment and asked, “Is it true that you secretly excavated a path down the mountain for the laborers collecting royal timber in the Quxi River District?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, saying, “Indeed, I witnessed that the road was treacherous and filled with miasma, so I was somewhat reluctant.”

The City God sighed, “Two of them were supposed to die tragically on the way. One was crushed to death by a giant log, and the other fell off a cliff. Your actions saved two lives. Do you know if this act has accumulated more merit or more karmic consequences?”

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, “Since the City God has brought it up, it must be the latter.”

The City God looked at this cultivator and, after a moment, smiled, saying, “I understand a bit why you are a ‘Master.’”

Deities observe the world, not just its events but also the hearts behind them.

The City God sighed again, “The actions of the world are like water accumulating to form rivers; the rivers can irrigate fields and benefit millions, but they can also flood and cause disasters. Perhaps a sudden flood could drown countless innocents, and in an instant, merits and demerits could shift, catching people off guard. As you ascend the mountain to cultivate, you must be cautious. Of course, I am lowly and speak lightly, so my perspective may not hold weight. I hope you will not let my words disturb your peace of mind; otherwise, I would bear a grave sin.”

Chen Ping'an thanked him once more.

He returned to the inn, lit the lamp on the table, and began transcribing a page of Buddhist scriptures to calm his mind. After he finished writing, he packed away his papers and scriptures.

As dawn broke, Chen Ping'an extinguished the lamp and stood by the window.

Upon closer examination of the principles of the mountain and water deities, one would find that they often diverged significantly from the moral codes established by Confucianism, not strictly aligning with the secular notions of good and evil.

As he climbed higher into the mountains, he began to resemble a true cultivator, a path he must follow.

It was akin to everyone growing up.

Chen Ping'an was actually in good spirits.

Having traversed so many mountains and waters, he had accumulated many objects, his possessions now plentiful.

As for the future of the Falling Cloud Mountain, it filled him with anticipation.

A single flower does not make spring; a garden in full bloom—that is the beautiful sight Chen Ping'an most hoped to witness.

Leaving the county town, he continued his journey across the land of Fuhua.

Without his jade hairpin or straw hat, he simply carried a bamboo box, dressed in a blue robe, and traveled alone.

That day, at a riverside shrine, after offering incense in the temple, he saw a thousand-year-old ancient cypress in the temple's rear hall, needing seven or eight strong men to encircle it. Its shade covered half the plaza. Beside the tree stood a stone tablet, inscribed by a literary figure of Fuhua, crafted with great care by local officials who hired skilled artisans to carve it. Though it was a new tablet, it exuded an ancient charm. After reading the inscription, he learned that this ancient cypress had survived numerous wars and calamities, standing resolutely through the ages.

Pleased with the text, Chen Ping'an took out his green bamboo writing box, paper, brush, and ink, using the bamboo box as his writing desk, meticulously copying the inscription word for word.

The inscription was lengthy, and as he wrote carefully, he lost track of time, oblivious to the approaching night.

The temple had a night curfew, but the temple priest, instead of shooing him away, brought two small benches with the temple boy and placed them beside the ancient tablet, lighting lamps to illuminate it. The lamps were covered with white gauze, elegant yet delicate, shielding them from the wind.

Upon seeing this scene, Chen Ping'an quickly ceased his writing and bowed in thanks.

The old priest waved his hand with a smile, assuring the guest to continue copying the inscription and mentioned that the temple had accommodations for pilgrims to stay overnight.

The old man instructed the temple boy, who then dozed off nearby, holding a key.

Feeling bored, the boy watched Chen Ping'an copy the inscription. The writing was neither particularly good nor bad, but he was diligent and neat. He had seen more impressive calligraphy at other temples, where literati had inscribed poetic verses, especially one literary figure who, drunk, had written cursive scripts all over a wall, which had garnered praise as a masterpiece in Fuhua's literary circles.

The young scholar's writing appeared rather ordinary.

After finishing the inscription, Chen Ping'an packed up his bamboo box and returned to the guest quarters. He pondered how to express his gratitude and decided that he would donate a bit more incense money when he left the next day.

The temple boy, stifling yawns, nearly felt as if a sleep bug had crawled into his ear, but he did not complain about the guest taking too long. The temple often had scholars coming to copy texts, so he was used to it. The old priest had a peculiar temperament, treating scholars with respect. He had heard his seniors say that the old priest had hosted many students coming to the capital for exams or to visit scenic sites, but over the years, none had achieved high office in Fuhua. Unlike other temples, where a few had produced successful scholars.

As Chen Ping'an walked through the corridor, he paused and glanced back.

The ancient cypress swayed in the breeze.

Chen Ping'an murmured with a smile, “The clear wind and bright moon stir the branches; could it be the sword immortal's blade shining.”

The temple boy was momentarily stunned, “What a good poem! Where did the young master read that?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “I’ve forgotten the source.”

The boy lamented, “If only the young master had come up with it himself! I’ll ask the old priest to find someone skilled in calligraphy to write it on the wall, which would surely bring more incense offerings to our temple.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, looking at the ancient cypress.

The boy thought the traveling scholar was implying that he had not come up with the poem himself and whispered, “Young master, let’s go; I’ll take you to the guesthouse so you can rest early. It may be small, but it’s clean. Don’t worry, I take care of it, and there are no pests.”

At this moment, the boy added softly, “If you happen to see any, please don’t report me to the old priest.”

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile, following the boy to the guesthouse.

The ancient cypress swayed gently.

The ancient tree spirit, on the verge of transforming into a human form, nearly shed tears in frustration, wishing he could smack the temple boy's head to wake him up.

You foolish child, do you not realize the great fortune the temple has missed?

If only they could get the sword immortal to inscribe that poem on the temple wall, it could transform the temple overnight! The incense offerings and fortune would surely rise.

Ten officials from the temple would not compare to a single stroke of the immortal’s brush.

However, the immortal had just shaken his head at him, so he dared not speak out, lest he offend the passing immortal and bring about misfortune.

That night, Chen Ping'an practiced his six-step stance, combining it with the sword furnace stance and the thousand autumn sleep stance.

In a half-dream, half-awake state, the intent of his fists flowed throughout his body.

Within his small universe, he engaged in different forms of cultivation.

Cultivating both body and mind must go hand in hand.

Chen Ping'an felt a stirring in his heart but did not open his eyes, continuing to immerse himself in his practice.

That night, the temple priest dreamed of a young man in a blue robe, carrying a branch from the ancient cypress, much like a wandering knight with a sword. The man revealed his identity, claiming to be the manifestation of the cypress behind the temple. He beseeched the priest to request a piece of calligraphy from the visiting immortal, insisting he must implore the overnight guest to fulfill this request before continuing his journey. His words were earnest, and the blue-robed man almost shed tears.

Upon waking, the temple priest sighed, seeming reluctant to impose on the young scholar who was unaware of the immortal’s presence. After contemplating for a long while, he remembered the cypress had historically provided protection to the temple, having numerous accounts of its miraculous deeds. Thus, the old priest put on his boots and clothes, leaving his quarters in the dark, but upon reaching the guesthouse, he hesitated, lingering for a long time without knocking. Instead, he turned to the ancient cypress and whispered, “Cypress Immortal, I apologize. I did not follow your words to request a favor. Immortals operate according to their own will; since the young master is unwilling to leave his calligraphy, it must mean the temple lacks sufficient merit and fortune.”

The ancient cypress remained silent, letting out a sigh, without pressing the old priest to change his mind.

Only at this moment did Chen Ping'an stop his stance and smile knowingly.

Chen Ping'an had always believed that the righteousness or unrighteousness of a place depended on the people within, not solely on the deities. It had to do with the order of precedence; as the saying goes, where there are green mountains, one need not worry about firewood.

The so-called green mountains still reside in the hearts of men.

Thus, the blue-robed figure flitted through the temple like the wind, quickly arriving beside the temple priest with a smile, saying, “It's just a small effort.”

The ancient cypress spirit, appearing as a blue-robed man, still had an ethereal form, knelt and bowed, “Thank you, Immortal, for your grace.”

The temple priest felt a bit flustered and was about to bend down to express his gratitude.

However, Chen Ping'an accepted the cypress spirit's bow calmly.

But the old man's gesture of gratitude was interrupted by Chen Ping'an's hand.

This was not because the spirit was lesser than a human.

Rather, in the path of the Dao, the gratitude expressed by the blessings of heaven and earth, as well as by the spirits of grass and trees, was actually for the rare opportunities granted by the Dao.

Having observed the City God’s night court, Chen Ping'an had like a cloud parting to reveal the moon, realizing a crucial truth.

For cultivators wishing to attain clarity of mind, one must return to the source.

Chen Ping'an asked the temple priest and the ancient cypress spirit to wait a moment. He returned to the guesthouse, took out a piece of golden talisman paper, sat upright, and after a moment of concentration, he wrote down the poem, shouldering his bamboo box as he returned to the ancient cypress and presented it to the blue-robed man, stating seriously, “You can bury this talisman at the roots of the tree and the mountain; it will slowly refine over time. On the path of the Dao, fortune and misfortune are uncertain, all depends on the heart. In the future, cultivate well, and may good deeds bear good fruit.”

The blue-robed man held the golden talisman with both hands, thanking him profusely, nearly moved to tears.

Chen Ping'an chose not to stay in the temple any longer and took his leave, with the bright moon shining upon him and his bamboo box.

Looking back, he saw the temple priest and the blue-robed wood spirit watching him depart. Chen Ping'an waved, continuing on his journey.

Well then, he had saved some incense money.

Not a loss.

With a smile, Chen Ping'an continued on his path, moving slowly in the quiet night, practicing his six-step stance.

Day and night merged, without restriction.

Such is the nature of the world; opportunities come with their own destiny.

This temple, encountering Chen Ping'an, perhaps became a so-called fortune.

Yet, in other temples, even if the feng shui greatly differed, should a different type of cultivator with a different temperament and affinity pass by, they might miss the opportunity altogether.

On the path of the Dao, there are countless roads, all leading upwards.

Thus, fellow practitioners are so rare and difficult to encounter.

Later, Chen Ping'an paused by the riverside in the Yuelong District of Fuhua, fishing alongside an old man who was evidently a Qi practitioner, though at a low level, perhaps at the Observation Sea level or Dragon Gate level. He had quite the setup, with many maidservants and a long row of fishing rods, along with countless bait prepared in large basins—enough to feed even the largest fish in the river.

Seeing that the young man in the blue robe appeared to be a pure martial artist at the fourth or fifth level, the old man ordered one of the maidservants to bring a large basin of bait. The maidservant smiled, saying there was no need for the young master to be polite; their master was always generous to newfound fishing friends, even adding that one wouldn't catch big fish if they didn't set a big net.

When the maidservant placed the basin down and spoke, Chen Ping'an nodded vigorously, recognizing the wisdom in her words. The old gentleman must be a transcendent figure in the fishing world.

For a moment, Chen Ping'an felt guilty accepting such a large basin of bait, and he raised his voice to inquire about the old gentleman’s title.

The old man laughed heartily, “Friends from the mountain often call me the Master of Filling the Sea!”

Chen Ping'an glanced at the basin, thinking that whether in the martial world or among the mountains, there truly was only ever the wrong name given by parents, but never the wrong nickname.

The old man consistently caught fish but was unable to reel in the rare giant fish he sought.

As evening approached, a massive ship passed by the riverbank, with armored soldiers standing solemnly aboard. The ship cut through the water, creating a great commotion, and the waves crashed against the shore, causing the bamboo fishing rods to sway violently.

The old man began cursing loudly, his voice strong.

From the ship emerged a stout warrior clad in dew armor, wielding an iron spear, gazing fiercely at the old fisherman on the shore.

A maidservant cautioned, “Master, it seems that is the great general of Fuhua, wearing a rare divine armor.”

“It’s General Gao Ling of Fuhua!” 

The old man squinted, stomped his foot, and cursed in anger, “Damn it, I’ve stepped into a pile of hard as iron dung! I’ve heard this fellow has a bad temper; let’s quickly pack up and leave!”

On the ship, that great general of Fuhua had a woman beside him, and Gao Ling lowered his head to whisper to her. She nodded and lightly leaped, standing poised at the ship’s railing, ready to spring into action.

Chen Ping'an slowly reeled in his line.

The conversation between the stout warrior and the woman was distinctly audible.

The richly dressed woman, adorned in fine silk, had learned that the old fisherman was a wild cultivator from another country, who went by the title of Master of Filling the Sea. She had a carefree nature and was merely a Dragon Gate-level cultivator with little combat capability. She directed Gao Ling to teach him a lesson—nothing fatal, just a harsh beating—then see if he might be persuaded to join her household as a guest.

Gao Ling hesitated, stating that the old man might not be willing, as he had already declined several invitations from the Emperor of the Qiyu Kingdom to serve him.

The woman responded with a soft “oh.”

Gao Ling understood the implication.

Though Fuhua itself did not hold much power, it had a surprisingly formidable backing, and with a woman of both noble birth and ethereal presence by his side, she was one of the ties linking Fuhua and that powerful ally.

Though Gao Ling appeared to be in his prime, he was actually past fifty, ranked third among the generals, but his fists were undoubtedly the strongest.

With a single punch today, he might just elevate his rank from third to second.

Thus, Gao Ling laughed loudly, “Why run? Why not come aboard for a drink first!”

The heavily armored general pressed his toes down hard, causing the ship to tilt dangerously, the clanking of iron armor sounding loudly, as the soldiers hurriedly grasped the railings.

Gao Ling leaped onto the surface of the river and splashed his way toward the shore.

One spear thrust out.

A cultivator at the Observation Sea level was not yet a highly regarded immortal teacher, merely a wild cultivator from the mountains, and it was best to submit to avoid trouble. Yet, if he didn’t know better, it would provide an opportunity for Gao Ling to demonstrate his strength before the woman.

However, just as Gao Ling was about to reach the shore, he suddenly found his vision blur, feeling a weight in his chest.

He was sent flying backward toward the ship.

A blue-robed figure had appeared out of nowhere, arriving in front of Gao Ling in an instant. He struck the general’s dew armor with one palm, sending him flying like a bolt of lightning, the wind whistling in his ears.

With a gentle push, Gao Ling soared into the air, landing unsteadily at the ship’s bow.

The blue-robed figure, after lightly pushing him off, leveraged the momentum to retreat several feet, executing a swift turn, before effortlessly returning to the shore, standing there with grace.

Gao Ling’s expression darkened, weighing whether to act tough or not. If he won this fight, he could forget about the matter. If he lost, he would appear incompetent, causing him embarrassment in front of the woman. That would leave him in a most awkward position, disliked by both sides.

The woman beside him sparkled with excitement, smiling, “It’s fine, no need to take offense, and certainly no need to pursue it. My master once said that the mountains below should not be underestimated. Amidst the great mountains and rivers, there are often remarkable figures. It was worth my while to take this long water route from the Green Warbler Kingdom; I finally got to see a so-called wonder of the world. Just a glance is a gain.”

Gao Ling sighed in relief.

On the shore, that person cupped his fists, as if to apologize to the ship.

Gao Ling was momentarily taken aback, then returned the gesture with a smile.

The woman shone even brighter, speaking to herself, “Well, isn’t that interesting? Gao Ling, I’ll remember this one!”

The ship slowly drifted away.

The old cultivator, who had wanted to strike up a conversation, suddenly found that the blue-robed guest had vanished from view.

What now?

The old cultivator rubbed his chin, then commanded his maidservants and attendants to move all the large basins to another spot, precisely where the blue-robed immortal had been fishing, as it surely would be a place of good fortune.

Once he settled down, he felt invigorated; indeed, it was the spot chosen by the immortal, as even the river breeze felt sweeter there.

In the distance, Chen Ping'an continued his journey.

Taking a slight detour, he walked onto a broad plain.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an halted and put away his bamboo box within arm’s reach.

But moments later, he furrowed his brow, pondering whether it was merely an illusion.

Chen Ping'an moved forward slowly.

The Sweeping Mountain Villa was considered a sacred place in the hearts of the martial world in the Kingdom of Wuling.

There were various rumors surrounding this villa.

Some said that the old senior Wang Dun never married because, when he was young, he traveled north and suffered a heartbreak, falling in love with a woman who later became the empress of the Jingnan Kingdom. Unfortunately, heaven did not favor them, and the matchmaker failed to connect them. Wang Dun, being a sentimental man, devoted himself to martial arts, resulting in his personal misfortune but great fortune for the entire martial world of the Kingdom of Wuling.

Others claimed that the villa’s brew of thin plum wine was actually an ancient recipe left by an immortal. Drinking a jar could extend one’s martial prowess by several years. Hence, the disciples taught by Wang Dun would all stand out, as they were all steeped in this plum wine.

There were also rumors of a highly guarded and intricate forbidden area within the villa, containing martial arts manuals personally penned by Wang Dun. Anyone who obtained one could become a top master in the martial world, rivaling Fu Loutai's blade techniques or Wang Jingshan's swordsmanship.

Of course, these were all myths, provoking much spittle from outsiders, but making insiders laugh and cry in disbelief.

One of Wang Dun's direct disciples, Lu Zhuo, found this quite frustrating, though his master never seemed to care about it.

Lu Zhuo was the least gifted among his peers, learning everything slowly—swordplay, blade techniques, fist techniques—he was not only slow but also faced towering bottlenecks, failing to see any hope of breaking through. Although his master frequently comforted him, he, too, had no solutions. Eventually, Lu Zhuo resigned himself to his fate. Nowadays, the old steward had grown frail, the eldest sister was married off, and his exceptionally talented senior brother, Wang Jingshan, had to shoulder the villa's responsibilities, which had genuinely delayed his training. In truth, Lu Zhuo was more anxious than Wang Jingshan, feeling that the latter should have long ventured into the world to sharpen his blade.

Thus, Lu Zhuo began to intentionally involve himself in the myriad trivial matters of the villa, planning to assist the old steward and his senior brother Wang with the burdens.

He would rise early at the hour of the hare, practicing stances, or practicing sword or blade techniques until the hour of the dragon, after which he would have breakfast and go to the old steward’s side to check the accounts, correspondence, and the operating conditions of the villa's various properties. He also needed to consult the old steward about the expenses of the many disciples. Around the hour of the snake, he would finish his lessons akin to an elementary student and then watch his junior brothers practice swordplay or his junior sisters practice blade techniques in the tranquil rear mountain of the villa.

The villa had many disciples and servants' families, so it established a school.

In the early years, the teachers at the school were highly learned but could not be retained.

They would stay for a year or two before resigning. Some were retired officials, while others were renowned reclusive scholars. Eventually, his master simply hired a juren (a degree holder) who had no hope of passing the imperial examination and ceased changing teachers. When the juren had to take leave, Lu Zhuo would step in as the teacher.

In the afternoons, Lu Zhuo would also teach a batch of fellow disciples the techniques of blades and swords. After all, his peers also needed to cultivate, so Lu Zhuo became the most useful person to employ. However, he felt no resentment, instead finding joy in being able to help.

Lu Zhuo’s day was thus filled with trivialities, and in the blink of an eye, the dawn blue sky would turn to dusk as the sun set and birds returned to their nests. Only after the hour of the dog, when the world dimmed and everything became hazy, could Lu Zhuo find time to engage in his own pursuits, such as reading miscellaneous books or perusing the mountain reports purchased by his master, learning about the extraordinary deeds of the mountain’s immortals. After reading, he found no longing or yearning, merely a respectful distance.

That night, Lu Zhuo personally held a lantern, patrolling the villa as per routine. Though there were many rumors in the martial world, the truth was that no one had ever dared to breach the rules of the Sweeping Mountain Villa.

In the rear mountain, his junior brother was still diligently practicing swordplay.

Lu Zhuo remained silent, choosing not to disturb him, and quietly continued his practice, executing a stance he had been working on for many years, which his eldest sister Fu Loutai and senior brother Wang Jingshan often used to tease him.

This stance was not one personally taught by Wang Dun but rather a crude boxing manual he had obtained by chance in his youth. His master did not mind Lu Zhuo practicing this stance, as he had read through the manual and deemed it harmless, albeit lacking significance. In any case, Lu Zhuo enjoyed it, so his master allowed him to practice according to the manual. It was proven that Wang Dun and his senior siblings were correct, but Lu Zhuo himself did not feel it was a waste of effort.

On his way down the mountain, he saw the old steward, who appeared slightly hunched, waiting at the foot of the steps.

Lu Zhuo hurried down.

The old steward had a thin face, a slender figure, and wore a blue long coat, but he frequently coughed, as if he had fallen ill years ago and had not fully recovered.

One of his legs had a slight limp, but it was not very obvious.

The old man, surnamed Wu, had an uncommon name: Fengjia. Aside from Lu Zhuo’s generation of peers, the younger disciples were unaware of the old man’s name. From Wang Dun’s eldest disciple Fu Loutai down to Lu Zhuo and his junior brothers, they all affectionately referred to the old man as Grandpa Wu. When Lu Zhuo first entered the villa, the old steward had already been working there, and it was said that he had been there for as many years as the villa had existed.

Lu Zhuo said softly, “Grandpa Wu, it’s windy and chilly at night; I’ll handle the night patrol for the villa.”

The old man waved his hand and continued patrolling with Lu Zhuo, smiling, “Lu Zhuo, I have two pieces of news to share with you; you might feel… disappointed, yes, disappointed.”

Lu Zhuo found this strange; the old steward seemed different tonight. In the past, the old man had given off an aura of fading vitality, like a candle nearing its end, which genuinely worried Lu Zhuo. Perhaps because he had resigned himself to his martial aspirations, he had begun to consider matters beyond martial arts, such as the old steward's late-life circumstances, whether the children had opportunities to take the imperial examinations, and whether the villa would have a more vibrant atmosphere this year.

“Lu Zhuo, you actually possess the aptitude for cultivation, and if you had been lucky enough to meet a good teacher in your early years, your future would not be small. Unfortunately, you encountered your master Wang Dun, and you squandered your potential on martial arts,” the old man slowly stated.

Lu Zhuo smiled faintly, about to respond, but the old man interrupted him, “Don’t say it doesn’t matter yet; it’s because you’ve never truly seen the grandeur of the immortals on the mountain. A Qi Jinglong, though not low in realm, is merely a friend you encountered by chance in the martial world, not a scholar but a peculiar individual, so you have not truly understood the path of cultivation on the mountain.”

Lu Zhuo was at a loss for words.

The old man continued, “Moreover, your martial arts talent is indeed rather ordinary, quite ordinary. Thus, the bottlenecks you face are real obstacles; you will find it challenging to overcome them, and perhaps you may never be able to.”

Lu Zhuo sighed, feeling somewhat melancholic. “Grandpa Wu, I know my own heart best.”

The old man seemed to share an inexplicable sadness, “Among the many children in the villa, I actually hold the highest hopes for your character. That’s why I let you inadvertently obtain that boxing manual. But many things in the world are so helpless; it’s not that you Lu Zhuo are a good person that life will go smoothly. In your youth, you cannot compare to your eldest sister or senior brother, and as you grow older, you will only watch your junior brothers and sisters soar past you. By the time you’re old, you may not even surpass their disciples, your nephews and nieces. So, whether you feel disappointed or not, I am genuinely disappointed—not in people’s hearts, but in the world.”

Lu Zhuo was taken aback, his lantern almost dropping as he opened his mouth but found himself speechless.

The old man turned to look at Lu Zhuo, “Lu Zhuo, let me ask you one last question: Do you mind living a life of mediocrity as a steward of the villa, year after year, enjoying life, but having little to do with you?”

After careful consideration, Lu Zhuo smiled, “I truly don’t mind. I’ll just serve as the steward of the villa.”

The old man nodded, “Very well. Do not underestimate yourself; with someone like you around, doing small tasks, there is still greater hope in this world for great deeds to emerge. So, my earlier disappointment is trivial; individuals like you, Lu Zhuo, are the hope of this world. It might sound shameless for an old steward of the Sweeping Mountain Villa to say such lofty words, wouldn’t you agree?”

Lu Zhuo smiled but did not wish to speak insincerely nor hurt the old man’s feelings, so he settled for a noncommittal response, “It’s alright.”

The old man laughed heartily; at this moment, there was not a trace of decay or frailty about him.

“Since you have passed my test of character, it’s time you switch paths to ascend higher. You should not waste your spirit on trivial matters!”

The old man declared, “I will leave the villa tonight. After hiding away for many years, it’s time to put an end to this. I’ve left two letters and a precious item in the account room, along with a secret technique. One letter you will give to Wang Dun, saying that this disciple of his has already wasted enough time and should be freed. The other letter you will keep with you to find Qi Jinglong and pursue cultivation, becoming an immortal among the mountains! A Lu Zhuo willing to remain a steward for life can still bring hope to the world, so a Lu Zhuo who climbs the mountains to cultivate and practice swordplay will surely benefit the world even more.”

Lu Zhuo’s face was filled with shock.

The old man grabbed Lu Zhuo’s head and struck his chest with a punch, dealing him a heavy blow that left Lu Zhuo seriously injured, his spirit in turmoil, yet he could not utter a word, overwhelmed by pain.

“Everything is good, but that timid temperament of yours is what I dislike the most. Do you think you, Lu Zhuo, should concede a place at the mountain summit to those worthless Qi practitioners?!” 

The old man fixed his gaze on Lu Zhuo, who was on the verge of fainting, and said in a low voice, “If you wish to pursue the path of cultivation, you must first cut off the bridge of longevity, to help you completely dispel that pure Qi! Don’t worry, the bridge of longevity will break but not shatter; my letter will be enough for you to rebuild it. After that, perhaps you can even continue practicing the Shocking Mountain Fist! Remember, grit your teeth and endure; if you can get through this, there will be hope. If you can’t, then you can comfortably remain a steward of the villa.”

When the old man released his grip, Lu Zhuo collapsed, the lantern in his hand crashing to the ground.

Lu Zhuo coughed up blood.

The old man crouched down, smiling, “Of course, I don’t go by the name Wu Fengjia; it’s just a name of a dead hero I took while roaming the martial world in my youth. He sacrificed himself to save a little beggar crushed by wheel, and that little cripple has practiced martial arts ever since, wanting to prove to this savior that a martial artist could give their life to save a child full of sores—that act was worth it!”

Lu Zhuo felt the pure martial energy gradually dissipate, the pain unbearable, yet he gritted his teeth, trying to listen carefully to every word of the old man.

The old man smiled, “I self-taught a crude boxing technique, which is viewed as average by most people—not a genius. Looking back now, the boxing manual contained mere ordinary techniques and stances. It wasn’t until I was over forty that I could boldly declare my intent to take revenge on the immortal’s residence of the nation's ruler. Everyone laughed at me, saying I was like an ant trying to shake a tree, unaware of my own limits! But well, the essence of my boxing style lies in the determination to move mountains and seas! Unfortunately, you, Lu Zhuo, have practiced the manual for years but have never been able to grasp it, and thus have never embodied the fist intent. That’s fine; there are many paths in the world. Whether you’re a good person, Lu Zhuo, matters little; whether or not you are my direct disciple is not important.”

Finally, the old man pressed two fingers together and lightly tapped Lu Zhuo’s forehead, putting him to sleep. After all, Lu Zhuo no longer needed to climb the heights of martial arts. The physical pain was meaningless; the turmoil of the spirit was the key to his future cultivation on the mountain.

The old man in the blue robe stood up, murmuring to himself, “My true name is Gu You.”

The old man smiled, “Before I meet that young man from the Yuantai Mountain, perhaps I should first visit the young man from the sword. If he’s dead, then I’ll consider it repayment for my Shocking Mountain Fist manual; if he’s not… heh, that seems unlikely.”

After pondering for a moment, the old man sneered, “I won’t bully him; since he’s competing as a pure martial artist at the peak of the Sixth Realm, I’ll just lower my realm and only use the Ninth Realm of martial arts to test him.”

On the plain.

Chen Ping'an felt increasingly uneasy.

A tremendous sense of crisis enveloped the heavens and earth.

There was no avoiding it; there was nowhere to run.

This was his second encounter during his travels in the North Julu Continent.

The first was at the foot of the Zhenrong Peak, where he met the sword immortal Ji Yue.

Chen Ping'an felt no panic; instead, in an instant, his heart became as calm as water.

Beyond the limits of his vision, an old man in a blue robe stood still, having cultivated for a long time with closed eyes.

When he opened his eyes, he stepped forward.

Soundlessly.

But in the next moment, the ground erupted like thunder in spring.

On the line.

Chen Ping'an narrowed his eyes.

The talismans in his sleeves, the golden robes, the two flying swords—at that moment, they were merely external tools, their usefulness rendered moot.

Chen Ping'an trusted his instincts.

The opponent was at least a martial artist at the Mountain Summit Realm!

The condensation of fist intent was astonishing.

Chen Ping'an began to run straight ahead.

To retreat or evade would diminish his fist intent by a fraction, and thus decrease his chances of survival.

To lose his intent meant to concede.

In the martial world, conceding often led to death.

One punch exchanged.

Chen Ping'an was immediately sent flying back dozens of feet, crashing to the ground, unable to stop his backward momentum, the soles of his boots worn smooth.

His body felt as if it was falling apart.

This was the first time Chen Ping'an executed the Immortal's Drumbeat technique, yet the moment he unleashed his fist, it felt shattered!

The other party, however, remained unfazed, moving leisurely in his courtyard, seemingly allowing Chen Ping'an to exchange a breath of pure Qi as he followed up with another punch.

As Chen Ping'an's vision blurred, he was struck directly.

He was sent flying once more.

Without any ability to counterattack.

The old man in the blue robe had already leaped into the air, delivering a punch down upon Chen Ping'an.

The punch struck Chen Ping'an squarely in the chest.

A great pit formed in the earth.

Chen Ping'an was drenched in blood, unable to rise.

His flesh and veins, his limbs and bones, his energy channels and acupoints—all were on the brink of collapse.

The elder, at least a martial artist at the Mountain Summit Realm, merely stood at the edge of the pit, hands clasped behind him, silent, looking down at the bloodied figure in the pit.

The young man, having lost consciousness, twitched a finger on his left hand, then tried to prop himself up with his elbow, struggling to rise.

The old man observed coldly as the young martial artist made various subconscious struggles.

The young man, through repeated efforts to raise his elbow and lift his back from the ground, required half an incense stick of time to finally prop himself up on his hands, swaying as he stood.

The old man remarked, “I’m standing right here; as long as you can walk up to me and extend a fist, you can live.”

The young man, having lost consciousness, with only a glimmer of his life force remaining, bent down and swung his arms, staggering forward.

Climbing out of the pit took twenty-some steps, as if a child were carrying a heavy basket under the blazing sun, climbing a mountain to gather medicinal herbs.

Step by step, drenched in blood, the young man just raised a hand.

The elder said nonchalantly, “I’m sorry, you still have to die.”

With a single hand raised, the elder struck, sending the young man crashing back into the pit.

The old man walked down into the pit, laughing scornfully, “The older one gets, and the higher the realm, the more one fears death? No wonder the strongest of the Third Realm only flickered briefly, unable to claim the title of the strongest for the Fourth or Fifth Realms! Since that’s the case, I think it’s best for you to die; that bit of martial fortune, given to someone like you, would dirty the manual!”

The half-dead figure remained silent.

The elder frowned and lowered his head, noticing the young man’s fingers twitching again.

The old man chuckled.

Very well!

One could say he was already dead, yet the intent of the fist lived on.

This was the most genuine meaning that could not be faked!

The old man laughed heartily.

*End of Chapter*

 ### Chapter 629: The Striking Style of a Tenfold Master

Chen Ping'an suddenly opened his eyes, furrowing his brows, nearly cursing aloud. It was deep into the night, the bright moon hanging high in the sky. He had slept somewhat heavily, and the pain that made him want to curse was undoubtedly real.

His body was already covered in dried blood, mingled with the muddy earth of the large pit; even the slightest movement sent a jarring pain through him. Nevertheless, Chen Ping'an took a deep breath, gauging his physical condition before sitting up abruptly.

Everything around him seemed normal. He couldn’t understand why that pure martial artist, at least at the Peak of the Mountain realm, had chosen to strike without killing him. Was it perhaps a custom of the Northern Continent, where one would randomly throw a few punches at someone they found displeasing during practice?

From above the pit, a voice rang out, “Finally awake?”

Chen Ping'an slowly rose to his feet. He didn’t even assume a fighting stance, but the martial intent emanating from him became increasingly pure and restrained. At the edge of the pit stood an old martial artist dressed in a long blue robe, the very same one who had been hiding his identity for years as the caretaker of the Sweeping Mountain Manor—Wu Fengjia. Aside from the sudden presence of Li Er, he was one of the three local Tenfold martial artists of the Northern Continent, Gu You.

Why did the Gu You dynasty, which dominated the surrounding nations, only have a weak Nascent Soul stationed at the Golden Scale Palace? And why was the Golden Scale Palace so feeble that it was regarded as a worthless hill by the Floating Sword Lake?

It was Gu You who had driven out the celestial beings from numerous surrounding countries using just his fists. He once declared, “Heaven is vast, and Earth is vast; celestial beings should roll away.”

True heroics require grand feats.

The old man chuckled, “Your martial intent isn’t too shabby. You’ve practiced the Six Steps Stance for over a million punches, right?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Close to one hundred sixty thousand punches.”

The elder asked, “Coming from a humble background, did you treasure that old, tattered fist manual you found in your youth, practicing it diligently since then?”

He had a keen insight. Anyone born into a wealthy family would never practice a manual like the Mountain Shaking Fist. Thus, Chen Ping'an clearly didn’t come from a well-off background.

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “I only started practicing when I was around fourteen.”

The old man looked somewhat pleased. “Everything else is easy; throwing punches is merely a matter of hard work. Anyone with a bit of perseverance can throw a million punches. The only challenge is maintaining the stance practice.”

Chen Ping'an felt confused throughout their conversation. However, he had no doubt that the old man meant him no harm. In fact, the benefits he gained from just a few punches were unimaginable—not merely in physical strength or spirit, but in martial intent and understanding of the heart.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an clenched and then slowly relaxed his fist, feeling that the title of the strongest in the Sixth Realm was already within his grasp. This was rare for him.

The old man introduced himself, “I’m Gu You.”

Chen Ping'an understood immediately; his foundational martial arts came from the Mountain Shaking Fist manual gifted to him by Gu Can from Mud Bottle Alley. So, he directly asked, “What about that Mountain Shaking Fist manual?”

The elder nodded, “It was likely one of my disciples who took it to your hometown. Our family suffered a great calamity years ago, and we fell apart, scattering like birds and beasts.”

The elder sighed, “As one ages, it becomes difficult to maintain ties to family. The younger generations must find their own fortunes; what else can be done? Out of sight, out of mind. Most will die from worry.”

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists, “Chen Ping'an from Baoping Continent, I pay my respects to Elder Gu.”

Gu You laughed, “You’ve got quite the audacity to let a Tenfold martial artist keep watch over you while you sleep half the day away.”

Chen Ping'an smiled sheepishly.

Gu You waved his hand, “I’ll accompany you for a bit; I have other matters to attend to and can’t chat too long.”

Chen Ping'an swayed slightly as he walked up the slope, keeping pace with the elder martial artist.

Gu You asked, “How many times have you faced off against the strongest martial artists?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Twice, once against a Third Realm and once against a Fifth Realm.”

Gu You shook his head, “In that case, you’re far behind that peer from the Central Plains, Cao Ci. That guy has faced the strongest every time and is truly unmatched.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Slow and steady, I still have chances against those in the Ninth and Tenth Realms.”

Gu You turned curiously, “Your martial arts teacher is Cui Cheng from Baoping Continent? Otherwise, you shouldn’t have this mindset.”

Chen Ping'an hesitated but nodded.

Gu You suddenly realized, “No wonder. But you must have faced a lot of hardships in recent years, right? That makes sense; without this kind of tempering, you wouldn’t have come this far.”

Gu You abruptly asked, “What did Cui Cheng think of the Mountain Shaking Fist manual?”

Chen Ping'an dared only to speak half the truth, slowly saying, “The martial intent is of a very high standard.”

Cui Cheng wasn’t here, and he had no reason to take a hit for him. Even if a Peak martial artist struck him, it would still be a heavy blow for someone of his humble Sixth Realm.

Gu You nodded, “No surprise, Cui Cheng has a keen eye.”

Cui Cheng from Baoping Continent had once traveled alone through the Central Plains, and although his final fate was dire, even Gu You, one of the top martial artists from another continent, considered him a true hero.

As for their martial arts prowess, since they hadn’t fought, Gu You wouldn’t admire Cui Cheng overly much. Outside of age and accomplishments, addressing him as ‘Senior Cui’ was no issue. Of course, if it weren’t for the “very high” assessment, Gu You would never have changed how he addressed him.

Chen Ping'an hesitated to speak.

Gu You said, “Feel free to say anything.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Is Elder Gu and the Sword Immortal Ji Yue from the Monkey Crying Mountain sworn enemies?”

Gu You replied, “Yes, sworn enemies, the kind where one must die.”

Chen Ping'an fell silent. The world was complex; it was filled with good people killing bad people, bad people killing bad people, and even good people killing good people. Many issues that didn’t involve major ethics or morality were often misunderstood, and making arbitrary judgments without true knowledge could lead to significant problems. One should never assume that just because it was clear-cut to them, it was so for everyone.

Gu You chuckled, “You’ve probably only heard about the strange occurrences in the capital of the Gu You dynasty, such as the jade seal and the giant serpent that threatened to flood the capital, attempting to create a dragon palace. However, I know very well that this is Ji Yue’s way of forcing me into action. If I go, it’s because I intend to; in fact, if Ji Yue doesn’t come looking for me, I would seek him out. Ha! An early mountain sword cultivator who almost exchanged lives with me—how impressive could he be?”

Gu You paused for a moment, speaking to himself, “Of course, he is impressive. That’s why I injured my foundation years ago, hiding for so long. Ultimately, it was my martial arts that weren’t high enough. Below the Tenth Realm, every step I took was decent, but once I entered the Peak, I couldn’t hold back, too eager to enter that legendary realm. Even if I didn’t think my mindset was flawed at the time, it was still a rush to improve my martial arts, leading to many misunderstandings. Kid, remember, being alive alongside peers like Cao Ci in your generation is both despairing and a great opportunity; if you can, you can motivate each other. Just don’t get killed by him with a few punches or lose your confidence. For martial artists, if your spirit falters, everything is over. Keep that firmly in mind.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I will.”

Gu You casually asked, “If you’re afraid of dying, why learn martial arts?”

This was a peculiar question. One might think it was logical to learn martial arts due to the fear of death.

Chen Ping'an replied, “It’s not that I’m afraid of death; it’s that I can’t die. I suppose it sounds similar, but they’re different.”

Gu You was silent for a moment, “That makes a lot of sense.” 

In fact, this was the aspect Gu You found most perplexing. A young martial artist, knowing his time was up, especially when he could say he was “already dead,” often found that it was precisely then that his martial intent was at its peak. This was no mere “fear of death.”

Thus, Gu You could be certain that once this young man died, if he left his spirit unattended, the world would suddenly gain a powerful ghostly entity that wouldn’t dissipate under the winds of fate but would, instead, seek life from death. To be so afraid of life and death to such an exaggerated extent—what kind of obsession did this young man harbor?

However, such words were pointless. His appearance was meant to find this young martial artist, who had once passed through the sweeping manor town. Only by truly experiencing life and death could one refine their martial intent, breaking through to a purer form.

Gu You spoke earnestly, “Once you head north, be careful. Not to mention that old monster in the north, there’s a Peak martial artist who isn’t a good person, killing at will. You, an outsider, would die and leave all your martial fortune in the Northern Continent. If they want to kill you, it would only take a few punches. You should either learn a superior escape technique to flee the mountains or not easily reveal your true martial realm. There’s no way around it; good or bad, they won’t hinder their training. Martial artists are the same, and cultivators even more so. One pursues pure martial intent, the other seeks the truth of the Dao. There are still rules to follow, but every individual who reaches a high position in cultivation isn’t foolish; they excel at avoiding restrictions.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “I will be careful.”

Gu You paused, gazing into the distance, “I’m glad that the Mountain Shaking Fist can be learned by you and has hopes of being carried forward. To be honest, even as the author of the fist manual, I must say that it’s not that impressive; at most, it has a little significance.”

Chen Ping'an replied earnestly, “Elder Gu, I truly believe the Mountain Shaking Fist has great meaning!”

Even back when he was on Ruined Peak, facing Cui Cheng, Chen Ping'an had always held this fist manual in high regard.

Gu You turned his head, laughing, “Even if you say such flattering words, I’m just a martial artist; I don’t have any celestial treasures to bestow upon you.”

This Peak martial artist had an astute eye. A young man taught by Cui Cheng wouldn’t continue traveling to the Northern Continent and practice endlessly unless he truly recognized and valued the Mountain Shaking Fist.

So, if others blurted out flattery without thought, it would only backfire, effectively asking Gu You to throw a punch at them. Perhaps in the world, only this young man from Baoping Continent was in a position to say such things rationally.

Keeping good words in one’s heart isn’t bad, but saying them is even better.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Three punches would be enough; I can’t handle more.”

The elder patted the young man’s shoulder, “Gu You’s three punches in the Ninth Realm certainly carry weight.”

Gu You suddenly said, “Do you know that my progenitor of the Mountain Shaking Fist didn’t realize that stance practice, standing practice, and sleeping practice could be combined into one?”

Chen Ping'an was left speechless.

Gu You pondered for a moment, “Actually, it could also include the Heaven and Earth stance.”

Chen Ping'an helplessly replied, “Using my head to touch the ground?”

Seeing the young man seemingly considering the feasibility of this idea, Gu You slapped Chen Ping'an’s shoulder with a hearty laugh, “Don’t get too foolish with your martial arts, kid! As martial artists walking the world, we should have some pride. If you practice like that, any girl seeing you would be scared off, and that’s not acceptable. Those who practice the Mountain Shaking Fist mustn’t lack admiration from the beauties of the world!”

After saying this, Gu You stood with his hands behind his back, gazing upward, seemingly lost in thought. Every martial artist wandering the world carries their own regrets and memories.

Chen Ping'an stumbled slightly from the slap and nearly fell.

When he straightened, the old man in the blue robe had already silently lifted into the air, drifting away like a wisp of smoke.

Chen Ping'an stared into the distance for a long while, knowing that Gu You was bravely facing death. But perhaps, the Monkey Crying Mountain would never again have a Sword Immortal Ji Yue.

Such is life.

Chen Ping'an took out a bamboo box and placed it on the ground, sitting upon it, then pulled out a wine gourd, drinking slowly. He wasn’t in a hurry to rush off, preferring to regain some strength first.

After three punches, if he could recover to the early level of the Sixth Realm within a month, that would be a stroke of luck. 

Since he wouldn’t be setting off any time soon, Chen Ping'an allowed his thoughts to wander. 

Regarding pure martial artists, Senior Cui had once mentioned a general saying.

Those in the Seventh or Eighth Realm die in their homeland, Peak martial artists die in their own countries, and those at the Tenth Realm die on their own continent. 

On the path of cultivation, one must strive for purity and sincerity. 

As Gu You said, many distractions can go unnoticed. 

This was indeed a terrifying thought.

In the end, Chen Ping'an held the wine gourd, lost in thought. 

To be alive, to reach the distant places he yearned for, was truly wonderful. 

However, some of the people in those distant places might not be too happy to see him next year.

Closer to home, there was the Ma family in Apricot Blossom Alley, and the Empress of the Great Li Dynasty. 

Farther away were the Mountain Moving Monkey from Zhengyang Mountain and the Xu family from Qingfeng City. 

And there were still more to observe. 

Some were hidden behind many curtains. 

One matter after another, one person after another, one place after another. 

Thus, Pei Qian, the eldest disciple, loved to keep accounts; it was just like her master. 

One used a pen and paper to record, while the other only kept it in her heart. 

No matter how vast the plains, one would eventually encounter mountains. 

Gu You stood atop one such mountain. 

Six black-robed figures wearing white masks stood together, leaving one behind while the other five quickly dispersed, fleeing in different directions. 

Fortunately, the elder in the blue robe seemed to have no intent to pursue. 

The remaining practitioner from the Deer Cutting Mountain bowed and clasped his fists, “Greetings, Elder Gu.”

Gu You asked, “Such a grand display, is it to kill someone? Don’t say that this is a soon-to-breakthrough Golden Body martial artist; even a traveler martial artist isn’t enough for you to kill. Since when did Deer Cutting Mountain not follow the rules? Or is it that you’ve never followed the rules, just prefer to handle matters cleanly?”

The one opposing Gu You was the leader of this group of assassins from Deer Cutting Mountain, a Nascent Soul practitioner. Yet, facing the old man in the blue robe, sweat beaded around the edges of his mask.

It was simple: Gu You, the national protector martial artist from the Gu You dynasty, valued rules above all else. Furthermore, if he chose to strike, he would dig to the roots, eradicating all.

If Deer Cutting Mountain had provoked Gu You, it wouldn’t merely be six deaths here.

The Deer Cutting Mountain assassin shook his head, “The rules of Deer Cutting Mountain have never been broken since the founding of our ancestor…”

In the next moment, Gu You, with one hand behind his back and the other grasping the Nascent Soul practitioner’s neck, lifted him effortlessly. Gu You didn’t even look up, merely gazing straight ahead, “The first to act dies first.”

The other five, who had been quite a distance away, suddenly fell silent, not daring to move.

Gu You slowly said, “If you had surrounded this person before I made my move, it would’ve been one thing. But after I’ve made my move, you didn’t leave quickly, and you still had the audacity to think of picking up the spoils. Do you think I’m a fool? You’ve barely reached the Nascent Soul stage; shouldn’t you be treasuring your life a little more?”

Gu You frowned slightly, lifting the unfortunate Nascent Soul practitioner, yet hesitating to strike immediately. It seemed this Peak martial artist, who had been dormant for many years, was considering whether to leave one alive to inform Deer Cutting Mountain. If he were to spare one, which would be more appropriate?

Gu You did not conceal his murderous intent, which was thick and palpable. The aura radiating around him turned the grass, trees, and earth within ten feet to dust, causing a cloud of dirt to fly.

The robes of the Nascent Soul practitioner crackled ominously as Gu You flicked his finger.

A stream of energy pierced through the practitioner’s forehead, and the Deer Cutting Mountain assassin, born of pure martial prowess, died immediately.

A Golden Body martial artist could die just like that.

Gu You calmly remarked, “Even a shift in the heart is a movement. The commotion you made sounds like a drum to my ears; it’s quite annoying.”

The Nascent Soul practitioner could no longer speak, so he could only ripple his thoughts, “Elder Gu, if you kill us six, no matter how profound your martial arts are, you may protect that young man for a time, but not for a lifetime. Deer Cutting Mountain has no fixed stronghold; our practitioners wander. Elder Gu can pursue and kill as he pleases; no one can stop you. If you meet one, he’ll die; however, as long as that young man isn’t by your side for even a few days, he will certainly die! I can guarantee it!”

Gu You asked, “A group of street rats from Deer Cutting Mountain can threaten me? Who gave you the audacity? Ji Yue?”

The Nascent Soul practitioner forced a smile, “Elder Gu, I’m merely stating a fact.”

Gu You considered for a moment, “It’s simple. I’ll spread the word and agree to a duel with Ji Yue at the Refining Mountain. Before that, he must eradicate Deer Cutting Mountain within a year. The disciples of Ji Yue on Monkey Crying Mountain will surely be delighted; they can play cat and mouse with you.”

The Nascent Soul practitioner’s expression changed slightly, “Elder Gu, we truly gathered without ill intent. The previous assassination attempt was fruitless and settled. This is an unbreakable rule of Deer Cutting Mountain. As for why we came, I cannot disclose it; this is also a rule of Deer Cutting Mountain, and I hope Elder Gu can understand.”

Gu You asked, “If I were to encounter you halfway, would I punch you to death?”

The Nascent Soul practitioner didn’t understand why this Tenfold martial artist would ask such a question, so he had to answer honestly, “Of course not.”

Gu You then asked, “You speak so fervently about the rules of Deer Cutting Mountain, hoping I will abide by them, yet why don’t you respect my rules? The one I did not kill with my punch is the same person you know my identity—knowing my status yet unwilling to restrain yourselves even for a few days. Do you really believe I need to stand here and articulate the rules for you to comprehend them?”

Gu You chuckled, “How strange! When did my rules become your excuse to act without restraint?”

At that moment, the Nascent Soul practitioner’s head was twisted off, rolling to the ground.

In the same motion, Gu You delivered a punch that shattered both the Golden Core and the Nascent Soul, leaving no chance for survival.

The backlash from the explosion of the Golden Core and Nascent Soul was tremendous, enough to rival a land tornado, but Gu You effortlessly dispersed it with a wave of his hand.

One Deer Cutting Mountain practitioner who attempted to use earth escape techniques was crushed under the force of Gu You’s stomp, silencing him completely.

With three Deer Cutting Mountain assassins remaining, they all fled in distant directions, each one too terrified to breathe.

Gu You stood with hands behind his back, turning his gaze toward a direction, sighing. 

That kid was supposed to be severely injured; how could he have such sharp intuition?

Is this also taught by the Mountain Shaking Fist? How did I, the author of this manual, not know?

But it made sense.

This kid’s intuition, or rather, his martial intent, was quite impressive.

For instance, when he was hanging by a thread earlier, Chen Ping'an had intentionally locked onto him with his martial intent. If someone as far removed in realm as Chen Ping'an dared to let his guard down, allowing himself to get distracted by frivolous matters, it would have only taken Gu You’s added punch for him to face dire consequences.

He wouldn’t die; he would merely be inexplicably struck down by a punch from a Ninth Realm master, collapsing without any gain.

In confrontations where realms are similar, even a slight difference can mean life or death.

Suddenly, a figure in blue robes came rushing over, bending down to breathe heavily, hands on his knees, blood dripping abundantly onto the ground.

Gu You smiled, “What a stubborn one who doesn’t know pain.”

Chen Ping'an straightened, his face pale and smeared with blood. He quickly sat down, wiping his face, “What brings you here, Elder?”

Gu You replied, “You still have the audacity to ask me?”

Chen Ping'an helplessly said, “I was already aware of this group of Deer Cutting Mountain assassins. I’ve sent a flying sword to a friend. In a few days, I can catch them unaware.”

Gu You inquired, “What friend? Someone from the mountain? Can they truly not fear the clingy mosquitoes of Deer Cutting Mountain?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Just a good friend. More patient than me, and not afraid of these characters. I don’t feel guilty asking for his help.”

Gu You nodded.

Gu You said, “This time, I’m truly leaving. You can take the remaining three; will you feed them some punches?”

Chen Ping'an smiled wryly, “Elder, that’s really not feasible.”

Gu You laughed and asked, “Then what do you say?”

Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged, hands resting on his knees, “Then allow me to learn the world’s most authentic Mountain Shaking Fist from you, Senior!”

The Deer Cutting Mountain assassins would rather die than disclose their secrets; this point Chen Ping'an had learned firsthand.

Gu You spoke sternly, “Learning fists while seated? Aren’t you going to stand up?”

Chen Ping'an swayed unsteadily, finally managing to stand, though his posture was still somewhat unstable. Yet his martial intent was remarkably upright, much like a student writing after learning to read.

The elder in the blue robe slightly bent his knees, twisting his wrist as he formed a fist, slowly extending it forward. With one hand clenched into a fist, the other retracted, he said, “In my Mountain Shaking Fist, the most important aspect is one fist against the enemy, and one fist guarding the heart. Therefore, even when facing the three founders of the sects, as long as the martial intent does not disperse, a person can die but still deliver another punch! No matter how celestial beings or techniques may overwhelm me, my Mountain Shaking Fist, once unleashed, is like opening a mountain! This was my realization when I was in the Seventh Realm, the reason I could write the preface of this manual. If you, Chen Ping'an, wish to surpass me one day, you must have this utterly ignorant ambition!”

The three Deer Cutting Mountain assassins had already begun to flee frantically; some summoned wind to fly away, others dashed on the ground, while still others used techniques to disperse into wisps of smoke.

The elder stepped forward, completing the Six Steps Stance in an instant, delivering a punch.

Switching stances, he unleashed another punch, and again he changed stances, still throwing another punch toward the sky.

Chen Ping'an stared wide-eyed, following the figure of the elder in the blue robe.

So this was the true Mountain Shaking Fist.

It wasn’t merely Gu You throwing three punches with his Tenfold mastery.

Rather, the martial intent of the Mountain Shaking Fist could be… so magnificent!

As for where the punches landed or the outcomes, Chen Ping'an didn’t even need to look; he wouldn’t bother.

Gu You stood firm after his punches, asking, “How was it?”

Chen Ping'an slowly replied, “It felt like observing a fist as if it were sword practice.”

Gu You scoffed, “Sword practice? What good is producing a sword immortal? My journey to the Gu You capital was to kill a sword immortal.”

Chen Ping'an scratched his head, saying, “Someone once said that practicing fists is akin to practicing swords.”

Gu You nodded, “There’s some truth in that, and the reverse holds true as well. Countless martial arts may die, but living out one martial intent is the true practice of martial arts.”

Chen Ping'an's eyes brightened, “Exactly!”

Gu You suddenly said, “It’s hard to say how high Cui Cheng’s martial arts are; feeding fists is quite mediocre. If it were me, I guarantee you, Chen Ping'an, would be the strongest in every realm!”

Chen Ping'an was left speechless.

His lips moved slightly, but some words remained unspoken.

Gu You shook his head, signaling the young man not to say more.

In the end, Chen Ping'an could only clasp his fists in farewell.

Gu You also returned the gesture, clasping his fists in respect.

It was unrelated to realms or ages.

In this world of the Mountain Shaking Fist, first was Gu You, then came Chen Ping'an.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 630: Does That Guy Dare to Come to Zhengyang Mountain?

Chen Ping'an had spent two days on the mountaintop, practicing walking on the stakes all day long.

In the early dawn of this day, a young man dressed in a blue scholar's robe rode the wind and approached. Upon spotting the ravine in the plain below, he abruptly halted and soon caught sight of Chen Ping'an atop the mountain. Qi Jinglong landed gracefully, looking travel-worn and disheveled. For a Nascent Soul cultivator to appear so ruffled, it was clear he had been in quite the hurry.

From the moment he glided down to the ground, Qi Jinglong remained silent, only revealing himself after he gently shook his robes, causing the aura of his talismans to dissipate.

Chen Ping'an smiled faintly, feeling the tension in his heart ease slightly. As long as Qi Jinglong was here, he could afford to relax a bit.

Before parting at Longtou Ferry, Chen Ping'an had gifted a flying sword hidden in a sword box from Zhu Quan of the Pi Ma Sect to Qi Jinglong, to facilitate their communication. However, he never expected it would be put to use so soon. Who knew those assassins from Ge Lu Mountain would be so reckless as to ruin their reputation just to target him, an outsider?

It was merely an exchange of a flying sword for communication.

Qi Jinglong's reply was simple and to the point: "Wait a moment, don’t die."

Now, as Qi Jinglong surveyed his surroundings, he asked, "What’s going on? Are there still two groups of people?"

Chen Ping'an sat on a bamboo crate and took out his sword-raising gourd, giving it a shake.

Qi Jinglong felt a headache coming on and quickly said, "Never mind that."

Chen Ping'an was currently wearing the "law robe" he had found by the roadside, took a swig of wine, and said, "One of the seniors, I can’t mention his name. Do you remember I told you about the 'ants moving mountains' in the southeast of Beiju Luzhou?"

Qi Jinglong nodded.

Chen Ping'an smiled and continued, "That senior is the one who authored the boxing manual I learned from. After he found me, he rewarded me with three punches. I didn’t die, and he also helped me deal with six assassins from Ge Lu Mountain."

"Is it him?" Qi Jinglong asked.

Chen Ping'an blinked but said nothing. That was enough.

Qi Jinglong didn’t press further. The second group of assassins from Ge Lu Mountain had left little trace near the mountaintop, which clearly indicated they were willing to break the rules to act against Chen Ping'an. This meant they viewed him as a Nascent Soul cultivator, or even a strong one at that. Only such a perspective would allow them to avoid any unexpected incidents while leaving no trace behind. Thus, a pure martial artist who could casually slay six Ge Lu Mountain cultivators after Chen Ping'an sustained heavy injuries from three punches must at least be a peak martial artist.

Even considering the Five Ridge Kingdom and the journey through the Lu Ying Kingdom to this Fu Qiu Kingdom, there hadn’t been any nine-realm martial artists. There was a female grandmaster in the capital of Da Zhuan, but she had to confront a fierce dragon in the Jade Seal River. Given the rumors surrounding the so-called 'ants' and some earlier tales from the southeast of Beiju Luzhou, the identity of this powerful figure was naturally revealed.

It was easy to guess: Gu You without a doubt.

Gu You, the peak martial artist, had never formally taken on disciples in his life. The grandmaster from Da Zhuan could only be considered half a disciple. Gu You had a peculiar attitude toward teaching martial arts.

There were many opinions.

The only reliable saying was that Gu You once claimed, "My martial arts can be learned by anyone, yet no one can truly master them."

After pondering for a moment, Qi Jinglong said, "Recently, you should be relatively stable. Since that senior has struck, he will almost certainly not leak any news. This means Ge Lu Mountain is still waiting for results and won’t send out another group of assassins to target you, so you can continue your journey. I’ll go find the founding ancestor of Ge Lu Mountain and try to clean up this mess. But let me make it clear: I have some assurance that I can get them to stand down, but getting them to break their rules for you and finding out who your backer is will require your own caution."

Chen Ping'an crossed his arms and replied, "I've got more experience wandering the rivers and lakes than you do."

"Are you planning to stay here for a few more days?" Qi Jinglong asked.

Chen Ping'an answered straightforwardly, "I need three more days to recover a bit before I set off."

Qi Jinglong took a step forward to the foot of the mountain and began to draw talismans, one hand behind his back and the other pointing. Each time he completed a talisman, he would fly back a distance of several dozen feet, moving fluidly without any stagnation. 

Let’s not forget, Qi Jinglong’s mastery of talismans was something that even Yang Ningzhen from Cloudy Palace would look up to with envy. The Chongxuan Office's Cloudy Palace was one of the ancestral homes of the talisman sects in Beiju Luzhou.

After about a stick of incense's time, Qi Jinglong returned to the mountaintop. "I can withstand the attacks of an average Nascent Soul cultivator up to three times, provided they are not sword cultivators and have no half-immortal weapons."

Chen Ping'an gave him a thumbs up. "You only saw me draw a wall of snow and mud talismans, and you managed to pick up seventy to eighty percent of the skill. Truly worthy of being the land dragon of Beiju Luzhou, so talented at such a young age!"

Qi Jinglong was too lazy to respond, preparing to leave.

The sooner he departed to find the decision-maker from Ge Lu Mountain, the more secure Chen Ping'an would be. As for finding that person, naturally, he would reason with them.

However, at this moment, Qi Jinglong glanced at Chen Ping'an. The skin visible beyond his law robes was mostly torn and bruised, with several spots of exposed bone. He frowned and asked, "Do you even know what pain is?"

Chen Ping'an chuckled. "Us martial artists, a few injuries…"

Suddenly, Qi Jinglong appeared beside Chen Ping'an and pressed down on his shoulder.

Chen Ping'an’s face contorted instantly, and he ducked, saying, "What’s the matter with you?!"

Only then did Qi Jinglong laugh, "Good, at least you're still human."

Qi Jinglong looked around, raising his hand to gather several golden lights into his sleeve, confirming that there were no hidden threats nearby.

Chen Ping'an asked with a laugh, "Aren’t you going to drink a bit more before you leave?"

Qi Jinglong retorted humorously, "Drink? So I can lose a few pounds of blood and rely on alcohol to make up for it? Is this how you pure martial artists do things?"

Chen Ping'an replied seriously, "To be honest, after taking three punches from that senior, my realm has skyrocketed. This is what they mean by 'a scholar should be looked at anew after three days'! If you, Qi Jinglong, don’t seize the opportunity to break through, you won’t have the face to see me in the future."

Qi Jinglong asked, "Are you now in the Golden Body realm or the Journey realm?"

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Talking to you is quite boring."

Without saying another word, Qi Jinglong soared away on the wind, his figure disappearing like smoke, vanishing in an instant.

It was undoubtedly due to the high-quality talismans at his disposal. 

He came and went in a hurry, just like that.

Chen Ping'an felt no guilt, nor did he need to thank him. The reasoning was even simpler. In the future, if Qi Jinglong called upon Chen Ping'an for help, it would be the same.

However, Chen Ping'an still hoped such opportunities wouldn't arise anytime soon. Even if they did, they should be delayed until his swordsmanship was higher, his speed in drawing swords was faster, and of course, his fists were harder. The later, the better.

Because in this world, the two words that could withstand scrutiny most, even more than his name, were: peace and safety.

After Qi Jinglong left, Chen Ping'an found himself with nothing to do. The process of healing, especially the recovery of his physical body, could not be rushed.

After hesitating for a moment, he decided there was no one around, so he began to turn upside down, supporting himself with his head on the ground, trying to merge the Earthly and other three stances together.

With his head touching the ground, he moved slowly.

Half a stick of incense later, Chen Ping'an slapped the ground with one hand, spinning in mid-air before standing upright again. He brushed off the dirt and dust from his head, feeling somewhat dissatisfied.

To his surprise, he spotted Qi Jinglong standing nearby, having returned.

Chen Ping'an said, "You’re like a ghost, scaring people in broad daylight?"

Curiously, Qi Jinglong asked, "What are you doing?"

Chen Ping'an continued to pat his head seriously, "Practicing walking the stake, a unique secret technique. Do you want to learn? I usually don’t teach it to just anyone."

Qi Jinglong shook his sleeves and placed two jars of celestial wine he had bought from the Bone Marsh on the bamboo crate. "Then you carry on."

Once again, Qi Jinglong transformed into a rainbow and ascended, his figure vanishing without a trace.

Chen Ping'an sat on the bamboo crate, picking up one jar of wine. It was authentic celestial wine, not the cheap rice wine found in the markets.

This guy seemed to be more generous than he was.

Zhengyang Mountain had recently held a grand feast to celebrate the ascent of one of the mountain's sword immortals, the granddaughter of the Tao family, Tao Zi, into the Cave Abode realm.

The Cave Abode realm was a significant threshold.

Entering the Cave Abode realm meant one had reached the fifth stage of immortality.

Along with the numerous congratulatory gifts from various factions, Zhengyang Mountain naturally offered even more substantial gifts, directly presenting the young girl with a mountain that had been relocated from outside, as her personal garden. Though it didn’t count as establishing a new peak, since the girl had yet to reach the Golden Core stage, Tao Zi now possessed three mountains rich in spiritual energy, making her dowry quite substantial. Whoever could become her Dao partner among the sword immortals would truly be blessed in the next life.

The mountain presented as a congratulatory gift from the Zhengyang Mountain Ancestor Hall was an old mountain from a small kingdom!

A small kingdom had resisted but was completely submerged by the iron cavalry of the Great Li Dynasty. The mountain’s deity had perished in battle, leaving it utterly unclaimed, so Zhengyang Mountain had calculated the merits of their cultivators' battles and purchased the northern peak of the small kingdom. Then, they assigned the task to their protective old ape, who utilized its innate divine abilities to sever the mountain's roots and carried the mountain away on its back. Since this northern peak wasn’t too towering, the moving mountain ape only needed to reveal a non-complete true form, around ten or so zhang tall, to carry the mountain like a young man shouldering a boulder, then boarding their own boat to bring it back to Zhengyang Mountain, allowing it to take root and be linked with the surrounding waters.

From a young age, Tao Zi had been the joy of those old sword immortals on Zhengyang Mountain. Besides her noble status, her innate talent was exceptional. Over the past five hundred years, she was an anomaly on Zhengyang Mountain, possessing a balance of roots, talents, disposition, and opportunities. This implied that although Tao Zi’s advancement speed wouldn’t be too fast, her bottlenecks would be minimal. Entering the Golden Core stage was without a doubt, and her chances of becoming a high-level Nascent Soul cultivator were very high.

For a celestial cave aiming to establish a sect, a prodigy like Wei Jin from Wind and Snow Temple would naturally be envied by all. Yet, a cultivator like Tao Zi was equally important. In some ways, a Nascent Soul who steadily ascends to the peak is more reliable than those young geniuses who achieve fame early, as "the tall wood in the forest will be uprooted by the winds."

However, among the congratulatory gifts, there was one that attracted the most attention.

Even though the giver had not made an appearance, the entire Zhengyang Mountain, excluding the Tao family’s ancestor, felt honored to be associated with it.

Because that gift came from the royal residence of the Old Dragon City, and the giver was none other than Song Mu, a prince of the Great Li Dynasty.

Before this, there had been some rumors saying that Tao Zi had once visited the Lizhu Cave Heaven in her youth and met then-unknown prince Song Mu.

On the new peak, the northern shrine was in ruins, requiring considerable manpower, resources, and wealth to repair.

Gradually, the banquet dispersed.

A graceful young girl stood outside the shrine's main entrance, a glossy green gourd hanging at her waist, a small gift from her wood-chopping elder brother from years ago. At that time, no one realized that this green gourd would turn out to be an invaluable treasure, later confirmed for its rarity by Tao family's ancestor after seeking out an expert.

Standing beside her was the burly old ape, the protector of Zhengyang Mountain.

Tao Zi withdrew her gaze from the grand shrine and turned to smile, asking, "Grandpa White Ape, is there really no chance for Sister Su to return to Zhengyang Mountain?"

The old ape shook his head, "She has become useless, staying at Zhengyang Mountain would only bring ridicule."

Tao Zi sighed, "That young master from Wind and Thunder Garden is really something. He could have secluded himself at any other time, but he chose to hide away at this crucial moment. How cunning."

The old ape grinned, "Once Li Tuanjing died, Wind and Thunder Garden collapsed significantly. The new master, Huang He, no matter how talented, is still a lone tree. As for Liu Baqiao, that coward who's troubled by love, don’t be fooled by his current splendor. He may break through quickly, but as time goes on, the path ahead grows dim. When Huang He leaves the mountain, that will be the day Wind and Thunder Garden is removed from the ranks."

The old ape gazed toward the ancestral mountain of Zhengyang Mountain.

He chuckled, "We Zhengyang Mountain are different. Every sword path can reach the peak. If we gather more power in the mortal realm, not only can we join the ranks of the sect heads, but there might even be more than one sword immortal at the fifth stage! At that time, all sword cultivators across the continent will have to bow to us. The more powerful we become, the more prosperous Zhengyang Mountain will be. We will rise even higher than the decaying Wind and Snow Temple on Zhenwu Mountain."

Tao Zi sighed, "Grandpa White Ape, I’m not really interested in what you’re saying."

Suddenly, the old ape said, "The Xus from Qingfeng City have arrived."

Tao Zi rolled her eyes, "That irritating pest."

The old ape chuckled.

The head of the Xu family from Qingfeng City had, after obtaining that cursed armor, conducted a thorough purge of the internal factions of the Xu family, quickly cleaning out hidden dangers. Other than the unfavorable impression left by moving from Zhu Sha Mountain years ago, and their poor reputation at the Great Li court, they had no more blunders. Moreover, the Xu family married their legitimate daughter to a lesser son of the Yuan family, making amends and allying with a powerful clan, which has since become a mid-tier force on the mountain. However, they were still a notch below Zhengyang Mountain. In recent years, the cunning and seductive woman from Qingfeng City had been subtly suggesting that her legitimate son should become Tao Zi's Dao partner, but the Tao family’s ancestor had yet to give his consent. In fact, if the Tao family and Qingfeng City were to form an alliance, it would be a significant boon for all of Zhengyang Mountain, as both families could enhance each other's reputation.

A gracefully dressed woman in palace attire, accompanied by a handsome young man in a crimson robe, approached riding the wind.

Tao Zi beamed and greeted, "Greetings, Madam."

The young man then bowed to the moving mountain old ape, "Greetings, Grandpa Ape."

The old ape merely nodded in acknowledgment.

The woman gently took the young girl’s hand, her expression affectionate, and smiled, "It’s only been a few years since I last saw my Tao girl, and she’s grown so lovely."

After exchanging pleasantries, the woman and old ape tacitly allowed the young couple to have some time alone.

The two elders walked toward the dilapidated shrine of the old mountain.

Outside the shrine, Tao Zi glared, extending her hand, "Irritating pest, where’s my gift?"

The handsome young man in crimson robe clenched his fist, then suddenly opened it, revealing nothing but lightly tapping it on the girl’s palm, "Hold on to this."

Tao Zi frowned.

The young man raised both hands with a cheeky grin, "Don’t rush. There will be a surprise from our Fox Kingdom in Qingfeng City soon. I can only wait and deliver my gift later."

Tao Zi scoffed.

The two strolled along the white jade square atop the old mountain, taking in the breathtaking views of Zhengyang Mountain, a well-known scenic area in the Baoping Continent.

The young man glanced at the glossy green gourd hanging at Tao Zi's waist, "Why isn't your wood-chopping brother here to congratulate you?"

Tao Zi scoffed, "You think he’s like you, free and idle? He’s now a prince of the Great Li, a ruler of half the continent."

The young man chuckled, "Don’t say such things casually."

Tao Zi retorted, "The consequences of my standing here saying things casually are different from you hearing them and saying them carelessly. Which one is greater?"

The young man was helpless. This cheeky girl spoke some undeniable truths.

He leaned on the railing, "Ma Ku Xuan is truly impressive; that sea tide cavalry has completely vanished. I heard the woman who angered Ma Ku Xuan back then knelt down and begged for mercy with her grandfather, but it didn’t change his mind."

Tao Zi responded, "Isn’t that the one from the apricot blossom alley in Lizhu Cave Heaven? After going to Zhenwu Mountain, she broke through as if she went mad. Just ignore that kind of person."

The young man fell silent for a moment, his expression darkening.

Because he recalled someone he had disliked at first sight many years ago. 

However, what slightly lifted his mood was that his dislike for that muddy-legged scoundrel was merely personal. The girl beside him and Zhengyang Mountain as a whole had an unbreakable feud with that guy; their enmity was as solid as nails. What was even more amusing was that that guy, for some unknown reason, after years of being a useless individual with severed connections to the Longsheng Bridge, turned to martial arts, enjoyed wandering outside, and spent years away from home indulging himself. Now he not only had a family business but a considerable one at that. Among all those mountains, including the Falling Ruins Mountain, his family's Zhu Sha Mountain had become a wedding dress for that person, providing a ready-made residence on a mountain. Just thinking about it soured his mood even further.

Unfortunately, news from Longquan County was heavily restricted, and with the saint Ruan Qiong stationed there, the Xu family from Qingfeng City didn’t dare to probe too deeply. Many fragmented insider stories still trickled back to her family through her sister's marriage to the Yuan family, but they were of little use. 

As long as that person lived, he would be a thorn in the heart of the future city lord of Qingfeng City.

Of course, he was also a thorn in the side of Zhengyang Mountain, very much so.

Currently, what Zhengyang Mountain feared the most was not the background of that young man himself, but the worry that the scoundrel might truly attach himself to Longquan Sword Sect. Especially if he were to become involved with that girl in the green dress with a ponytail, it would become a significant issue. After all, she was Ruan Qiong's only daughter.

Longquan County was an unspoken forbidden zone between the Great Li court and the mountains; no one dared to investigate it recklessly. 

This was because Saint Ruan Qiong was the undisputed chief offering of the Great Li Dynasty.

The last two emperors of the Great Li Song family treated this swordsmith from Wind and Snow Temple as a distinguished guest.

The young man glanced back.

Inside the ruins of the old mountain shrine, the woman and the old ape discussed the situation in the Baoping Continent before transitioning to the main topic, speaking softly, "That Liu Xianyang, once he returns to Longquan Sword Sect from the Chunjun Chen family, will be a huge problem."

The old ape mocked, "Compared to us at Zhengyang Mountain, what’s your family's minor future troubles?"

The woman’s brows furrowed, "In the mountain for two or three decades, time flies. Both our Qingfeng City and Zhengyang Mountain aim for the sect head position. Without long-term concerns, there are immediate worries. Especially that Chen fellow; he must die."

The old ape said indifferently, "Just don’t let me find an opportunity, or with one punch, everything will be clear."

The woman retorted angrily, "Is it that simple?!"

The old ape countered, "If I don’t go looking for trouble with him, that kid should be counting his blessings. Does he dare to come to Zhengyang Mountain for revenge?"

The woman sighed, knowing well that even if Liu Xianyang entered Longquan Sword Sect and became Ruan Qiong's direct disciple, he wouldn’t stir up much trouble. As for that muddy-legged scoundrel, even if he had temporarily amassed an impressive fortune, facing off against Zhengyang Mountain, backed by the Great Li court, he would still be like an ant shaking a tree. Leaving aside the Great Li and the old sword masters of Zhengyang Mountain, just the moving mountain ape beside her was not something a young martial artist from a crumbling mountain could contend with.

Yet, for some reason, the woman had been feeling uneasy over the years.

The old ape smirked, a look of irony on his face. "Madam, what do you think of the sword immortal Wei Jin from Wind and Snow Temple?"

Although the woman didn’t understand why the old beast was asking this, she still replied, "He is undoubtedly the foremost genius of the continent, the first person after Li Tuanjing and before Ma Ku Xuan."

The old ape remarked, "So, if Wei Jin were to challenge Zhengyang Mountain, would we dare? Could he strike us down with one sword and make us bow our heads?"

The woman laughed, "Of course we would dare, but it would also be impossible."

The old ape concluded, "A scoundrel from Mud Bottle Alley, an ant with severed ties to the Longsheng Bridge, even if I lent him courage, would he dare to come to Zhengyang Mountain?!"

"That might not be too pleasant to hear." 

The woman paused for a moment, then slowly said, "I believe that person would dare to come."

The moving mountain ape burst into hearty laughter, nodding, "Indeed, he had the guts to fight me back then. His courage is quite something. However, no one will protect him anymore. Once he leaves Longquan County, if he dares to come to Zhengyang Mountain, I guarantee he will only get to look up at the Zhengyang Mountain Ancestor Hall before he dies at the foot of the mountain!"

Far away, tens of thousands of miles beyond the Baoping Continent, on a mountaintop where Qi Jinglong had drawn a talismanic thunder pool.

A young man clad in a black robe had been wandering on the mountain for a full two days, either practicing the stakes or idly watching the exquisite talisman-drawing skills of Qi Jinglong from the edge of the mountain.

Chen Ping'an had completely abandoned the idea of practicing the Earthly stake.

It wasn’t that his posture was too embarrassing; it was simply that forcibly merging the four stances would only lead to a conflict in his boxing intent, losing all meaning.

In recent times, he had focused more on cultivation than on boxing practice. After all, his body was currently too weak. Too much stake practice would only harm his foundation. The three punches from a peak martial artist had struck him down to the point that an ordinary Golden Body realm martial artist would have died three times over. Even an average Journey realm martial artist would likely have perished. As for Chen Ping'an, he wasn’t saying he was stronger than an eight-realm martial artist; in fact, he had effectively died once.

That evening, as dusk fell, Chen Ping'an squatted beside his bamboo crate and drew some ordinary yellow paper talismans.

He had already drawn seven or eight hundred talismans in total. Among the array formation manuals that Sui Jingcheng had searched from the first wave of Ge Lu Mountain assassins, three types of quite powerful killing talismans were included. Chen Ping'an learned them on the spot. One was the Heavenly Department Thunder Talisman, derived from the secondary path of the ancestral method of lightning talismans. Although it wasn’t a genuine thunder talisman, it didn’t matter as Chen Ping'an had plenty of talismans. Another was the Great River Flooding Talisman, a water talisman, and the last one was the Soil Gathering Talisman, a type of earth talisman.

The yellow paper was inexpensive; it could be bought in the markets. Compared to the celestial dan sha, which required the use of celestial currency, it wasn’t much. Moreover, Chen Ping'an had also bought a pile of jars and bottles of mountain vermilion from the old hawthorn street in Chunlü Pu. One thousand randomly drawn talismans would be more than sufficient, even if he wanted to draw another thousand.

Chen Ping'an categorized the stacks of talismans and placed them neatly on top of the bamboo crate.

It seemed like they could summon a rain of talismans at any moment.

After admiring them for a moment, feeling satisfied, he packed them away and stored them in his sleeve, which felt heavy, perhaps this was what it felt like to have excess money weighing you down.

Finally, leaning against the bamboo crate, Chen Ping'an sat on the ground, picked a blade of grass, brushed off the dirt, and slowly chewed on it while cradling the back of his head with both hands.

The fastest thing in the world isn’t a flying sword; it’s a thought.

For example, he could instantly arrive at the Mud Bottle Alley and Falling Ruins Mountain in Longquan County, and then suddenly find himself on the steps of the Upside-Down Mountain.

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes, immersing his mind, gradually drifting into sleep.

He didn’t know how long it had been, but when he opened his eyes again, he saw light.
