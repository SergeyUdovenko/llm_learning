 **Chapter 423: The So-Called Martial Arts Performance**

The Longquan Sword Sect, under the leadership of its master Ruan Qiong, had recently accepted over a dozen registered disciples, finally bringing some life to the previously quiet mountaintops.

Speculation ran rampant about how many disciples the sage Ruan Qiong would ultimately choose as his formal apprentices.

The reason for these temporarily registered disciples at the Longquan Sword Sect was largely due to the great Li's Song family placing immense importance on the sword-forging master Ruan Qiong. The court specifically selected twelve exceptionally talented young boys and girls and sent a thousand elite cavalry to escort them all the way to the foot of the Longquan Sword Sect’s mountain.

At that time, Ruan Qiong was busy forging swords and did not make an appearance. Instead, a black-robed young man, who had recently ascended to the Golden Core stage, was left to handle the reception. Once the children learned that this black-robed youth was a genuine Golden Core Earth Immortal, their eyes sparkled with excitement. The reputation of Ruan Qiong as a sage, along with the elite soldiers of the Li court as escorts, coupled with the prestige of the Longquan Sword Sect, had already left a profound impression on these children.

The path to cultivation, becoming an immortal on the mountain, was said to be fraught with unknowns and dangers. If one could join the Longquan Sword Sect and catch the eye of Sage Ruan, ultimately becoming a formal disciple, it would signify a guaranteed ascent to at least the mid-Five Realms of immortality, leading to a smooth journey ahead.

Among the twelve, one was identified as an extremely rare innate sword body, destined to nurture his own flying sword.

Three others possessed Earth Immortal potential, while the remaining eight were all considered promising candidates for mid-Five Realms cultivation.

It was clear that the Li family was sparing no effort in supporting Ruan Qiong.

After the twelve settled in, Ruan Qiong only made a brief appearance during his sword-forging, confirming their cultivation potential. He then entrusted his other direct disciples to teach them, knowing that the following process would involve continuous selection. For the Longquan Sword Sect, merely having the potential to become a Qi Practitioner was just a stepping stone; true talent and fundamental disposition were far more crucial in Ruan Qiong's eyes.

Upon arriving at the mountain, they discovered that Master Ruan had a daughter named Ruan Xiu, who favored wearing blue garments and sporting a ponytail, making her unforgettable at first glance.

Many of the young boys were filled with excitement, though they dared not express their feelings.

The younger disciples of the Longquan Sword Sect liked to refer to Ruan Xiu as "Senior Sister."

Ruan Xiu was friendly with everyone but was not particularly close to any of them. After speaking with them a few times, she resigned herself to being called Senior Sister by others.

Over time, those who began to stand out or felt the pressure realized that Senior Sister was the most peculiar existence within the sect.

This Senior Sister was never seen cultivating; she either kept to herself or was in the forbidden sword furnace, assisting her father in forging swords. Otherwise, she would wander between the nearby mountains. It was only later that everyone learned that the three mountains surrounding the main sect—Baolu Mountain, Caiyun Peak, and Xiancao Mountain—were actually rented for three hundred years and did not belong to the Longquan Sword Sect.

Ruan Xiu also had a courtyard filled with old hens and fluffy chicks. Occasionally, she would watch her Golden Core peers as they meticulously explained cultivation steps and taught the unique breathing techniques of the Longquan Sword Sect, breaking down a set of superior sword techniques said to originate from the Snow Temple. Senior Sister Ruan Xiu would never get close to anyone, instead balancing a handkerchief atop a mountain of pastries, leisurely enjoying her snacks before leaving after finishing.

Some keen-eyed disciples noticed that whenever Senior Sister left, their second senior brother, a solemn black-robed Golden Core Earth Immortal, would visibly relax.

Aside from Senior Sister Ruan Xiu, there was also their second senior brother, who was almost like a half-master, residing alone by the Longxu River, and their fourth senior brother, Xie Ling, born with a pair of long eyebrows. The youngest of the group, Brother Xie, had never shown kindness to the younger disciples, yet he was responsible for enforcing the sect’s rules. Initially, some of the junior brothers grumbled about his stern demeanor, but a rumor heard from a small town left everyone in shock.

Xie Ling's ancestral home was in Taoye Lane, where an ancient ancestor still lived, a Daoist Heavenly Lord from the North Julu Continent.

A Twelve Realms Immortal.

Before heading up the mountain, only a few among the twelve knew that Earth Immortals were divided into Golden Core and Nascent Soul stages.

As for the realm beyond Nascent Soul, nobody had heard of it, mistakenly believing it to be the peak realm of Qi Practitioners.

Once on the mountain, their second senior brother, the no-nonsense black-robed Golden Core Earth Immortal, explained the divisions of Qi Practitioners to them. They learned about the upper Five Realms, including the Jade Purity Realm and the Immortal Realm.

Afterward, aside from a few naive or overly confident children, everyone else was too intimidated to even breathe in the presence of their stern fourth senior brother.

Only when he was with Senior Sister Ruan Xiu did Xie Ling ever show a smile, and he was the only one who did not call her Senior Sister, instead affectionately addressing her as "Xiu Xiu."

However, Ruan Xiu seemed equally distant with him, which eased the hearts of many younger disciples.

Since nobody received special attention from Senior Sister, there was no need for disappointment.

One day, Ruan Qiong made another brief appearance, succinctly stating two matters before retreating back to the sword furnace.

The first was that anyone who became a formal disciple would receive a sword personally forged by him.

It was well-known that Master Ruan was the foremost sword-forger in Baoping Continent, so the twelve were understandably excited, even the second senior brother, who usually remained indifferent, and the third senior sister, who had returned to the mountain to hear their master’s guidance.

The second announcement was that the Longquan Sword Sect had acquired a new mountain, and he encouraged them, stating that anyone who reached the Nascent Soul stage would have the right to host a summit ceremony on their own mountain. Moreover, as the first disciple to ascend to Earth Immortal status, according to prior agreements, only Dong Gu would be permitted to break the norm and choose a mountain for his cultivation residence. This would be publicly announced by the Longquan Sword Sect.

However, Dong Gu declined, requesting to open the summit only after he reached the Nascent Soul stage.

Ruan Qiong agreed.

The third senior sister, Xu Qiao Qiao, who had grown accustomed to being called that by the younger disciples, went down the mountain again to the shop by the Longxu River, where the Longquan Sword Sect thrived. For the first time, Ruan Xiu accompanied her, leaving Xu Qiao Qiao both surprised and delighted.

Fourth senior brother Xie Ling wanted to follow them, but when Ruan Xiu merely looked at him in silence, he understood the hint and obediently stayed on the mountain.

While walking down the mountain, Ruan Xiu asked, “Actually, you’re my father’s first disciple. Just because Dong Gu reached the Golden Core stage first, you ended up being called third senior sister. Doesn’t that bother you?”

Xu Qiao Qiao, the abandoned disciple expelled from the Snow Temple, replied honestly, “It’s a bit disheartening, but I have no issues with Dong Gu being second senior brother.”

Ruan Xiu said nothing in response.

After a moment’s silence, Xu Qiao Qiao, who had lost her thumb when wielding a sword years ago, asked, “Senior Sister, is there really a chance I could reach the Nascent Soul realm one day?”

Ruan Xiu admitted, “It’s difficult. Compared to Dong Gu, who will inevitably reach Nascent Soul within a hundred years, you have many variables. Reaching Golden Core is relatively easier for you, and my father will help you; he won’t favor Dong Gu over you. But getting to Nascent Soul will be much harder for you than for Dong Gu.”

Xu Qiao Qiao’s face fell.

For ordinary immortals, becoming a Golden Core practitioner was already a tremendous fortune, one that would allow them to burn incense for their ancestors and secretly rejoice beneath the covers.

Yet in the Longquan Sword Sect, and after witnessing the grandeur of the Snow Temple’s peak, Xu Qiao Qiao found Golden Core status far from sufficient.

To make matters worse, Ruan Xiu added, “As for your junior brother Xie Ling, he will be the first disciple of the Longquan Sword Sect to reach the Jade Purity realm. If you’re already feeling jealous of him now, believe me, you’ll only become more envious as time goes on.”

Xu Qiao Qiao bit her lip, her footsteps heavy.

Dong Gu was the one with the lowest status among Master Ruan Qiong’s three first disciples, having been born from the forest. Yet he had transformed into the revered second senior brother and a Golden Core Earth Immortal.

Xie Ling, on the other hand, was a local town boy, the youngest, who had never experienced hardship. Yet he was the most fortunate, with his ancestral lineage being that of a Daoist Heavenly Lord, and he even received a wondrous treasure comparable to an immortal weapon from a high-ranking Daoist.

Only she, Xu Qiao Qiao, had the most difficult background, worked the hardest, yet faced the most treacherous path in her cultivation.

Ruan Xiu picked up a branch by the mountain path, casually holding it as she said, “You think people can die from jealousy, right?”

Xu Qiao Qiao’s eyes turned red.

Suddenly, Ruan Xiu smiled softly and said, “Though you might very well reach a state where your body decays and you die of old age, it will still be far less than what Xie Ling and Dong Gu achieve. However, I still prefer you a bit more, though that doesn’t help your cultivation at all.”

Xu Qiao Qiao turned her head to wipe her eyes with the back of her hand, then smiled back at Ruan Xiu, “Senior Sister, thank you.”

Ruan Xiu stopped and nodded, “Thank me? Then remember to bring me some pastries next time you come up the mountain. The shop in Qilong Alley, you know which one.”

Xu Qiao Qiao was taken aback for a moment, then burst into a bright smile, “Oh, my dear Senior Sister!”

Ruan Xiu laughed along.

She only escorted Xu Qiao Qiao to the foot of the mountain, beneath the plaque that the Emperor of the Great Li—or more accurately, the former emperor—had bestowed upon the Longquan Sword Sect. After bidding farewell, Xu Qiao Qiao activated her Qi and stepped onto her flying sword, riding the wind away.

In Longquan County, this was a privilege reserved for disciples of the Longquan Sword Sect.

For other Earth Immortals, daring to fly through the air would lead to Ruan Qiong’s strict enforcement of rules.

The earlier batches of great Li cultivators who came to test the waters, including the sword cultivator Cao Jun, had learned the hard way about Ruan Qiong's regulations through various tragic fates.

Ruan Xiu stood at the foot of the mountain, looking up at the plaque. Her father disliked having "Longquan" repeated in the name, and Xu Qiao Qiao and the other two first disciples were well aware that he hoped one of them could eventually drop the "Longquan" and stand alone as "Sword Sect" at the pinnacle of Baoping Continent. At that point, that person would become the next sect master.

Ruan Xiu felt she understood her father's concerns better than anyone, yet every time he privately urged her to practice more diligently, she would agree verbally while her mind wandered to thoughts of pastries and braised meat.

This made Ruan Xiu feel somewhat guilty.

She decided to suppress that thought, planning not to mention to her father whether it was possible to improve the meals for the junior brothers and sisters, perhaps adding meat to every meal.

Unfortunately, her junior brothers and sisters would not have that fortune.

She, the Senior Sister whom she was reluctant to admit was not good enough.

As Ruan Xiu returned to the mountain with a heavy heart.

Ruan Qiong had quietly left the divine peak and arrived at the governor's office in Longquan County.

Governor Wu Yuan had been waiting for a long time and immediately got to the point without any formalities, explaining a pressing official matter.

Currently, within the Great Li territory, some mountain forces likely supported by other countries were stirring.

Especially since the beginning of this spring, there had already been three major conflicts, resulting in seven casualties among the Zhan Gan Lang, inciting the court's fury.

After learning the details of these conflicts and the intentions of the Great Li court, Ruan Qiong thought for a moment, “I will send Xiu Xiu, Dong Gu, and Xu Qiao Qiao to handle this matter on behalf of your Great Li court.”

Wu Yuan was clearly surprised and troubled, “Miss Xiu Xiu will also leave Longquan County?”

In fact, Ruan Qiong had a secret agreement with the Great Li Song family, with clear responsibilities and rewards outlined in black and white.

However, for many years, it had been the Great Li court that "gave" without ever "taking." Even this time, the Longquan Sword Sect was to serve the Great Li court as per their agreement. The Minister of Rites had already instructed via a secret message sent by flying sword that as long as Sage Ruan was willing to send Dong Gu, a Golden Core Earth Immortal, it would suffice as a show of sincerity. They should not impose excessive demands on the Longquan Sword Sect. Naturally, Wu Yuan did not dare to take liberties.

Thus, upon hearing that Ruan Xiu would also be leaving the mountain, Wu Yuan felt uneasy for both emotional and logical reasons.

Understanding why Wu Yuan and the Great Li court would feel troubled, Ruan Qiong smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I will instruct Xiu Xiu to avoid taking action as much as possible during this trip. Moreover, even if any unforeseen circumstances arise, I will not hold your Great Li accountable.”

Wu Yuan still did not dare to agree outright. Ruan Qiong might say so, but how could Wu Yuan take it seriously? The world was complex, and if any significant mishap occurred, the ties between the Great Li court and the Longquan Sword Sect would inevitably suffer. The Song family had invested so much effort; if it all went to waste, only Master Cui Zhan could bear the burden for the entire Great Li.

So, Wu Yuan did not beat around the bush and stated that he must report to the Ministry of Rites.

Ruan Qiong nodded, “That’s fine. Governor, please give me a prompt reply.”

Then Ruan Qiong asked, “I wish to select a few individuals from the Lu Clan’s surviving convicts to become registered disciples of the Sword Sect. You can report this along with the other matters to the court and see if they can approve it. In the event of a conflict with those Zhan Gan Lang, you’ll also be better prepared mentally.”

Wu Yuan forced a smile, “Understood.”

After discussing the urgent matters, Ruan Qiong left without dragging his feet.

He left behind a frowning Governor Wu, pondering how to articulate these two matters when reporting to the court.

The Great Li court had created a highly secretive underground organization under the control of National Master Cui Zhan, with all involved personnel referred to as Zhan Gan Lang. Whenever dispatched from the capital, three members would form a team: one from the Astral Bureau, one from the Master’s Bureau, and one from the Yin-Yang School, tasked with gathering local talents suitable for cultivation.

Once picked by the Zhan Gan Lang, even candidates already selected by Qi Practitioners but not yet brought to the mountain had to give way.

Perhaps that was the origin of the name Zhan Gan Lang.

After Cui Zhan became the National Master and the Great Li's power flourished, history did not see significant conflicts arise due to this issue. However, after several incidents, the immortal sects and wild cultivators in the Great Li settled down, for every single Zhan Gan Lang had the backing of the mighty embroidered tiger.

At an immortal’s residence guarded by a Nascent Soul, an elderly Golden Core practitioner had tested a young boy from the mountain for six years, meticulously honing him to become his direct disciple. Yet he was discovered by a passing Zhan Gan Lang who recognized the boy as a promising talent. The elderly Golden Core was furious at the unreasonable demands of the Zhan Gan Lang, even offering a large sum of celestial money, but the Zhan Gan Lang insisted on taking the boy.

Amidst their arguments, a fierce battle broke out, resulting in two Zhan Gan Lang being killed on the spot and one escaping.

Logically, the actions of the elderly Golden Core were reasonable and had already given the Great Li court enough face. Moreover, the mountain where the Golden Core practitioner resided was one of the few renowned immortal dwellings in the Great Li.

However, in the end, they were surrounded by six thousand Great Li cavalry, nearly a hundred martial secretaries, along with hundreds of incredibly rare Mo family machines and over a hundred Qi Practitioners summoned by the Ministry of Punishments, all for what was beautifully termed “a martial arts performance!”

The battle was fierce, and the Great Li even deployed the Northern Sacred God of the Great Li.

Ultimately, the once-great immortal sect in the northern borders of the Great Li was nearly razed down to half of its mountain, suffering severe losses, and was reduced to a second-rate power. Among them, the Nascent Soul ancestor perished, while the elderly Golden Core practitioner was personally beheaded by a Great Li general. That head, still wide-eyed in death, was carried by a sword cultivator who “delivered” it to many mountain tops along the borders.

After that, the spirits of the mountain immortals within the Great Li territory were considerably subdued, and even some arrogant forces already allied with the Great Li court began advising their direct disciples to behave.

It was said that after the conclusion of that war, the rarely seen National Master the Embroidered Tiger appeared at the summit of that mountain, but instead of punishing the remaining “rebels,” he merely had a stone tablet erected, stating it would be useful in the future.

That stone tablet at the mountaintop remains blank to this day, leaving one to wonder whether the National Master simply forgot about this old matter or if the right moment had not yet arrived.

———

On a high mountain peak in the northern borders of the Great Li, where an immortal cave had been rooted for many years, a Confucian-clad elder who had only recently ascended the mountain stood beside a blank stone tablet, pressing his hand against its surface as he gazed south.

Atop the mountain, there was only the elder, with no one accompanying him.

All the elders from the immortal sects who had experienced the bloody massacre of those years gathered nervously not too far from the peak.

As for the younger disciples who had joined the sect later, they were strictly ordered to remain within their residences, and anyone daring to wander would be punished severely.

The once high-and-mighty elders of the Great Li’s northern sects exchanged fearful and helpless glances, dreading that the Great Li National Master might suddenly issue an order for an autumn reckoning, wiping out the already fragile revival of the mountain.

With a solemn expression, the Embroidered Tiger Cui Zhan suddenly smiled mischievously, “You, Chen Ping An, like to reason, don’t you? This time, I will see if you can still do so.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 424: The Young Hero Meets the Great Hero

After an hour aboard the ornate boat transformed from a nuclear-carved skiff, they broke through a sea of clouds and landed amidst the misty peaks.

They had arrived at Ziyang Manor.

From a higher vantage point, this immortal sect rivaled the grandeur of a worldly royal palace. In the center, a sprawling array of magnificent structures shimmered under the sunlight, casting shades of purple and gold.

Once Chen Ping’an and his group disembarked, a tall female cultivator who introduced herself as Wu Yi, the True Monarch of Cave Spirits, stowed the skiff into her sleeve. As for the enchanting young maidens who had accompanied her, they transformed into slips of talisman paper, which Wu Yi casually flicked into a nearby meandering river, turning into waves of ethereal energy that mingled with the water.

An old, slender figure immediately emerged on the opposite bank. He knelt in reverence, his forehead touching the ground, and called out, “A humble spirit of the Jixiang Temple pays respects to the Ancestor of Cave Spirits! I am here to express my gratitude for your grand kindness!”

Zhu Lian slapped Pei Qian on the head and whispered, “Your fellow cultivators have appeared. Aren't you going to greet them?”

Pei Qian rolled her eyes.

Wu Yi maintained a dispassionate demeanor, saying, “If there’s nothing else, return to your Jixiang Temple.”

The deity quickly stood and transformed into a wisp of faint golden smoke, vanishing into the river.

With a smile, Wu Yi explained, “This is the downside of being out in the world; it’s hard to find peace.”

Chen Ping’an nodded in understanding.

Wu Yi casually inquired, “Young Master Chen, among the companions you traveled with last time, what happened to the girl in the red cotton jacket, whom my father favored? Why is she not here?”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “They are all studying in the Great Sui now.”

Wu Yi seemed somewhat regretful.

Her father had once revealed that the tall youth named Yu Lu was the hidden crown prince of the fallen Lu dynasty! He exuded a rich dragon aura, making him the most delectable delicacy in the world.

Back then, her father had inexplicably held back, and she dared not act recklessly under his watchful eyes, missing her chance. She wondered if she would ever have the opportunity to feast upon such a delicacy in the future, perhaps breaking through that damned Golden Core bottleneck.

In pursuit of a breakthrough to reach the current realm of the “End of the Great Dao,” her brother had become the River God of Cold Food River, while she herself diligently practiced Taoist side techniques. It couldn’t be said to be useless, but progress was agonizingly slow, enough to drive a person mad.

Must she really endure a hundred or a thousand years, living in her father’s shadow? Always on edge, fearing that one day he might grow hungry or find himself in a life-and-death struggle, and resort to feeding on his own children?

Years ago, when she and her unfortunate brother accompanied their father to meet the national master of the Great Li, Cui Zhan, the experience had been less than pleasant. Their father had been struck by the ancient divine powers of a embroidered tiger using an ancient inkstone, losing three hundred years of cultivation. Afterward, her father had vented his fury on her and her brother, leaving them in a wretched state. Nonetheless, the outcome had been favorable; their father finally left Huangting Kingdom, freeing her and her brother from the weight of his presence. After all, throughout the long years, countless descendants had been consumed by this irascible father.

Moreover, both Ziyang Manor and Cold Food River had become recognized bastions of the Great Li, standing independently outside the Huangting Kingdom.

Wu Yi was merely an alias. As the matriarch of Ziyang Manor, her true form was a descendant of the ancient Shu's dragon. If it weren’t for the family letter sent by her father, even with Chen Ping’an being accompanied by a martial artist from the Far Wanderer realm, she would have found no reason to pay him any mind. After all, each path—whether a narrow bridge or an open road—was meant to be walked alone. Why would she be so courteous as to personally greet a young man?

As Wu Yi led Chen Ping’an and the others along the smooth riverside road, laid with large slabs of blue stone that mirrored their surroundings, Pei Qian, holding her travel staff, kept an eye on the mirror-like pavement, watching a charcoal-skinned girl grin and beam with delight.

Wu Yi had not engaged in much idle chatter with Chen Ping’an aboard the boat, so she took this opportunity to briefly introduce the history and origins of Ziyang Manor.

Chen Ping’an could only manage to respond politely; in such matters, even someone like Liu Baqiao from Thunder and Lightning Garden or Li Huai would likely surpass him.

Perhaps due to the establishment of a water estate and the refining of a water-character seal, Chen Ping’an could sense subtle currents of water essence hidden within the massive blue stones beneath his feet.

As he surveyed his surroundings, Chen Ping’an understood.

In this world, descendants of dragons inevitably cultivated near water. Even the dragon descendants who seemed closer to the mountain roots of the Great Dao, once they achieved Golden Core, still had to obediently leave the mountain peaks, transforming into dragons in rivers and streams; they could never escape the significance of water.

Surely, the cultivators of Ziyang Manor throughout the ages would never fathom why their founding ancestor had chosen this location to establish their residence and expand their lineage.

Ziyang Manor was among the top immortal sects in Huangting Kingdom, yet it was not like ordinary immortal caves built atop mountains. Instead, it was situated beside a beautiful river with a broad view. The water, formed from the confluence of mountains and streams, was named Iron Seal River, the upper reaches of the third-largest river in Huangting Kingdom, the White Crane River, which was second only to Cold Food River and Yu River. Thus, the rightful water deities of Huangting Kingdom were honored and enshrined, assisting the royal family in managing eight hundred miles of waterways.

It was known that in the realm of civilization, the allocation of mountain and water deities was crucial to the stability of the realm and could determine whether an emperor could sit steadily on the dragon throne. Since the slots were limited, the deities of the Five Sacred Mountains were claimed on a first-come, first-served basis, often decided by the founding emperor. Generally, later emperors would not easily replace them, as it could be a significant upheaval. All deities associated with rivers and lakes, as well as minor local deities, could not be recklessly handled by any emperor, no matter how foolish and tyrannical they were; even corrupt officials in the court would not dare to treat this matter lightly.

Whenever the national treasury was abundant enough to exchange for sufficient divine money, and with the permission of one of the 72 Confucian academies, a gentleman could appear, mouth full of heavenly decrees, to "point out the rivers and mountains" for a nation, then the court could justifiably create a new legitimate deity for its mountains and rivers, thereby reinforcing the national fortune and stabilizing the aura of the realm.

This was what was known as the auspicious signs of a prosperous era, which would surely be celebrated by civil and military officials, bringing national jubilation. The emperor would often be greatly pleased, granting amnesty to the imprisoned, as he would be destined to be heralded in history as a rejuvenator of the kingdom and a wise ruler.

However, such ceremonies beneath the mountains had long been ridiculed by the monks above as “adding a layer to the commoners’ coffins and adding wood to the emperor’s dragon throne,” scoffing at it.

As for why there were often lustful shrines and temples within the borders of various nations, and why they persisted despite being repeatedly banned, was it truly due to the weakness of the courts, unable to eradicate them?

In truth, many of these temples were unofficial and unrecognized by the Confucian academies, unable to summon a gentleman's permission. Thus, the courts would turn a blind eye to these flourishing lustful shrines. Some courts even secretly funded these illicit shrines with divine money, covertly encouraging local literati and artists to lead the way in burning incense, hoping to spark a following among the local populace.

Iron Seal River also had a legitimate river god, the humble old man who had hurried away earlier.

For hundreds of years, this river god had been a puppet of Ziyang Manor, and the trials faced by the disciples of the lower five realms often involved the river god, who was mocked by peers as “the dead friend not dead, the poor Taoist helps you pick up your wallet.” The river god would dispatch water spirits to send to their deaths; those poor souls were almost like offering their necks to be slaughtered by nascent cultivators. Only those fortunate enough could escape disaster. Over time, the water spirits naturally birthed from Iron Seal River were no longer sufficient, requiring the river god to personally invest in enhancing the water essence. In years of poor harvest, he would have to bring gifts to seek the aid of the immortals of Ziyang Manor, begging them to drop some divine money into the river, enhancing the water's spiritual energy to hasten the growth of water ghosts and spirits, lest it hinder the trials of Ziyang Manor’s inner disciples.

It sounded rather demeaning, almost like a desperate survival, yet countless river deities in Huangting Kingdom envied it immensely.

The reasoning was simple: Iron Seal River was merely a river god, but its divine body was as solid as that of the third-largest river deity of Huangting Kingdom, the White Crane River.

What was this based on? Naturally, it was the meager leftovers scraped from Ziyang Manor over the years, accumulated year after year, coupled with the incense offerings from the temple where the divine body resided.

Cultivators of Ziyang Manor had historically disliked outside interference in their practices. Many esteemed officials and nobles who came seeking them could only stop at Jixiang Temple, which was two hundred miles away from Ziyang Manor.

Upon stopping, they would naturally burn incense and pay respects to the deities. There were also many shady dealings that required the river god of Iron Seal River to communicate with Ziyang Manor, as Ziyang Manor was quite adept at wealth generation. From the three realms of cultivation to the Dragon Gate realm, whenever they were invited out for “traveling,” there would be a general price. However, the cultivators of Ziyang Manor always held themselves in high regard; even if worldly nobles were wealthy, these immortals might not agree to meet them. Thus, it required the Jixiang Temple of Iron Seal River, familiar with Ziyang Manor, to help facilitate introductions.

During this time, the river god of Iron Seal River would never dare to profit from the situation; he wouldn’t earn a single copper coin. Every time outside ministers and nobles offered money to honor the immortals of Ziyang Manor, they would handle the affairs themselves, and upon success, a portion of incense money unrelated to Ziyang Manor would naturally flow to Jixiang Temple.

As they neared Ziyang Manor, they encountered a broad white jade plaza outside the manor gates.

The plaza was already bustling with individuals waiting for the return of their Ancestor. Ziyang Manor had inner and outer gates; the inner gate cultivators consisted of the direct disciples of the founding ancestor, Wu Yi, as well as past manor lords and their students, along with the venerable Dragon Gate elders and the influential cultivators in charge of various affairs. The outer gate was more mixed, including average qi practitioners, wandering cultivators who sought refuge in Ziyang Manor, pure martial artists, and generations of servants and attendants—naturally, the outer gate outnumbered the focused qi practitioners by far.

Almost a thousand people.

In the plaza, everyone stood according to their ranks, ensuring no misalignment in their positions.

To prevent Chen Ping’an from misinterpreting the situation as a show of dominance, Wu Yi smiled and explained, “I haven’t shown my face in Ziyang Manor for over a hundred years. In my early years, I declared that I had chosen a blessed cave to enter seclusion. I was simply tired of the social interactions that I wished to avoid, so I chose to hide away from everyone.”

As Wu Yi stepped onto the white jade plaza’s edge, everyone knelt in unison, their foreheads touching the ground, calling out in unison, “Congratulations, Ancestor, on your return from seclusion!”

The thunderous greeting felt like a clap of thunder to Pei Qian’s ears.

This kind of spectacle, such grandiosity, made Pei Qian’s eyes shine with excitement.

Wu Yi raised a hand.

Pei Qian couldn’t help but marvel; the thousand-odd individuals who had been kneeling on the ground seemed to have eyes sprouting from their heads, standing up in unison with a rustle.

Wu Yi walked forward, and Chen Ping’an intentionally lagged a step behind, not wanting to detract from the presence of the ancestor. However, to his surprise, Wu Yi paused too, sending a ripple of sincerity through her heart lake, her words laced with genuine warmth: “Young Master Chen, there’s no need to be so polite. You are a rare guest at Ziyang Manor. Although this small territory lies in a rural area, far from the sage-like, the etiquette of hospitality must still be observed. So you may simply walk alongside me.”

Wu Yi, with her proud nature, was known for her untamed spirit among the earth immortals of Huangting Kingdom. She had initially approached Chen Ping’an with a sense of duty, but since Chen Ping’an had behaved with utmost propriety and did not flaunt his connections with her father, the embroidered tiger, or Wei Ban in front of her, she felt more at ease, hence her heartfelt words.

Chen Ping’an smiled and shook his head, saying, “True Monarch Wu has returned to the immortal estate for the first time in a century. If it were a normal day, I would dare to walk alongside you, but today, that simply cannot do. I hope True Monarch Wu will lead the way, and we shall follow closely behind.”

Wu Yi chuckled, no longer insisting, and proceeded ahead alone.

He was a young man who understood his place.

Though he was perhaps a bit too rigid and old-fashioned, much like a schoolteacher—she didn’t find it unpleasant, but it didn’t particularly please her either.

As Wu Yi moved forward, a path immediately opened up through the sea of people on the plaza.

Only five or six people gradually followed behind Wu Yi. Those with the highest status in Ziyang Manor stood closer to her; for instance, the middle-aged cultivator to Chen Ping’an's right was the current manor lord, an earth immortal at the Golden Core level. In contrast, the two cultivators of similar rank to Pei Qian, Zhu Lian, and Shi Rou were even higher in seniority than the manor lord—one was in charge of rewards and punishments, and the other handled finances. Thus, the position of the manor lord was largely ceremonial, with no real power, merely a figurehead to liaise with the Huangting Kingdom’s court and other sects.

Of the seven manor lords throughout Ziyang Manor’s history, only one had risen to the position through innate talent; the remaining six, like the current one, had been propped up to that realm through Ziyang Manor’s divine money. Their true combat abilities were far inferior to those of earth immortals from major sects, especially those wild cultivators who had fought their way through.

The foundation of Ziyang Manor was not merely this; there were also former manor lords or disciples whom Wu Yi had taken in during her early years, and some elders who had lost hope in the Great Dao, their Golden Core decaying with time, forced to rely on the abundant spiritual energy of Ziyang Manor’s few estates, living like sickly mortals clinging to life.

All those in Ziyang Manor were speculating about the identity of the young man carrying a bamboo box.

Could he be a new disciple of the Ancestor of Cave Spirits? Might he be the next candidate for manor lord?  
(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 425: A Distinguished Guest?

Wu Yi led Chen Ping'an into the Ziyang Mansion, making a beeline for the central Ziqi Palace. She instructed the mansion's lord to prepare a grand banquet that evening to welcome the distinguished guest.

Once inside the Ziqi Palace, Wu Yi asked everyone to wait in the Sword Command Hall, stating she would personally arrange accommodations for Young Master Chen.

A distinguished guest?

The group exchanged glances, intrigued.

Could it be the direct disciple of a Nascent Soul immortal from the Great Li, or perhaps the scion of a prominent family from the likes of Yuan and Cao?

Indeed, Wu Yi personally settled Chen Ping'an and his companions before she made her way to the Sword Command Hall, where the mansion's higher-ups had congregated. She took her seat on a meticulously carved zitan throne and began to receive reports on various matters, such as the income and expenditures of the Ziyang Mansion over the past century, the cultivation progress of some promising disciples, and the condition of several elders in the mansion. She mostly listened without offering any comments. After all, it wasn’t easy to disappear for a hundred years, acting as if she were simply a hands-off manager, while still selecting puppet lords to run the place.

Everyone knew the truth: the ancestral figure had little interest in mundane affairs. The formal reports were merely a formality.

Wu Yi didn’t hide her boredom, leaning to one side with her chin propped up on one hand, nodding occasionally.

Overall, the Ziyang Mansion could be described as "flourishing."

That was about enough.

Wu Yi was too lazy to concern herself with trivial matters outside of cultivation.

The creation of the Ziyang Mansion and her role as the founding figure had been a spontaneous decision made in a fit of boredom all those years ago.

Moreover, many of the descendants of the dragon clans were fond of displaying their establishments and showcasing the treasures they had amassed.

The Huangting Kingdom was one of the remnants of the ancient Shu Kingdom after its fragmentation. It was as if the God Water Kingdom had mysteriously collapsed overnight, but it remained a coveted treasure land for the dragon clan descendants due to its rich waterways. Additionally, ancient sword immortals favored this place for slaying dragons, leading to many falling in battle, which resulted in an abundance of magical treasures. Though most were gathered by the strong dynasties of the God Water Kingdom and became essential national heirlooms, many priceless artifacts were still quietly collected by her father over the years.

She knew best just how wealthy her father truly was.

The magical artifact she possessed, a carved boat made from a rare core, was simply a small gift from her father when she first reached the Cave Dwelling realm.

However, her father’s collection was among the most extravagant in all of northern Bailing Continent, particularly among the Earth Immortals.

The old dragon city, the Fu family in the south, might surpass it slightly, but that was the result of the entire Fu clan’s two thousand years of accumulation, while her father had achieved such wealth through his own efforts.

Thus, Wu Yi harbored a mix of resentment, fear, and respect towards her father—resentment on the surface, fear deep within, and respect buried in her heart. It was likely her brother felt similarly.

Wu Yi lifted her head as someone inquired about how to host the esteemed Young Master Chen.

After pondering for a moment, she replied, “You needn’t concern yourselves with this matter; I will give the necessary instructions myself.”

---

Wu Yi’s arrangements were quite amusing, placing Chen Ping'an and his companions in a six-story building akin to a treasure house.

Each level was filled with the treasures collected by this Cave Spirit True Monarch and the various cultivators of Ziyang Mansion throughout the ages.

Before departing, Wu Yi mentioned that the top two floors were off-limits and hoped they wouldn’t wander upstairs; the other four floors were open for exploration.

Given the expansive nature of the building, every floor above the first had living quarters, studies, and even a martial arts hall on the third floor, housing three towering mechanical puppets. Thus, Chen Ping'an and his companions had no need to worry about being surrounded by beautiful treasures without a place to rest.

Just on the first floor, Pei Qian felt an overwhelming desire to sprout an extra pair of eyes.

This trip to the Ziyang Mansion had truly opened her eyes, filling her with excitement.

Previously, she thought that aside from the treasure box gifted by Yao Jinzhi, acquiring one or two treasure racks would be the pinnacle of her dreams. Now, upon entering this building in the Ziqi Palace, she realized that true wealth could be so much more extravagant!

Now, she didn’t need Chen Ping'an to remind her; she wouldn’t dare to touch any of those peculiar ancient artifacts without permission.

Determined to stay awake all night, she resolved to view all the hundreds of treasures on the fourth floor; otherwise, she would regret it for a lifetime.

While Pei Qian and the equally thrilled Shi Rou admired the sights on the first floor, Chen Ping'an and Zhu Lian stood on the fourth floor, gazing down at half of the Ziyang Mansion.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “In the past, when I imagined what my future mountains would look like, I was merely a penniless dreamer. Now it seems, Ziyang Mansion serves as a vivid example.”

He quickly added, “Actually, I wasn't poor back then either.”

Zhu Lian asked, “Young Master, this True Monarch of Cave Spirit doesn’t seem to be just any ordinary Golden Core Earth Immortal, does he?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “He’s essentially equivalent to a significant portion of a Nascent Soul cultivator.”

After all, they were guests in someone else's domain; Chen Ping'an refrained from elaborating on the intricacies.

Zhu Lian understood the implications.

Wu Yi, being part of the Ziyang Mansion, undoubtedly had access to celestial formations, akin to a small world, and could almost be viewed as possessing Nascent Soul combat strength.

Zhu Lian joked, “If a wild cultivator from the mountains were to sweep through this building, wouldn’t they strike it rich? I’ve heard there’s a wild cultivator of the Jade Purity realm on Bailing Continent.”

Chen Ping'an pulled out a jug of wine from his storage and handed it to Zhu Lian, shaking his head, “The existence of the Confucian Academy poses a significant deterrent to all Earth Immortals, especially those at the upper five realms. They can’t keep tabs on everything, but once the Confucian Academy sets its sights on someone, it means there’s no escape, no matter how vast the world is. This, in turn, suppresses many powerful cultivators from clashing.”

Zhu Lian took a sip of wine and laughed, “Why is it that within the Haoran world, the constraints on us pure martial artists are relatively low? Is it because there are so few martial artists at the eighth and ninth realms? I’ve heard that if a martial artist killed an emperor, the Confucian Academy might not even send someone after them.”

Chen Ping'an spoke softly, “This involves many long-buried ancient secrets. Cui Dongshan isn’t keen on discussing them, and I’m not particularly interested either. Back in my hometown, Longquan County, when I first set out on my travels, the highest official I encountered was the kiln supervisor and later the newly appointed county magistrate. I always felt that they were worlds apart from the emperor. Later, a noblewoman from the Great Li imperial palace, the biological mother of Song Jixin, even sent someone to kill me. I’ve kept that score in mind. When I met Song Jixin at the cliffside academy, we talked about it. But to be honest, even now, I can’t fathom him being a prince of the Great Li. Gao Xuan is a little better; after all, when we first met, he was dressed splendidly and had attendants by his side. But Song Jixin still seems like that carefree guy from back then.”

Zhu Lian raised his wine jug and lightly clinked it against Chen Ping'an's sword-raising gourd. Only now did Chen Ping'an take his first sip of wine, having kept the gourd untouched until then.

Zhu Lian sighed, “What if one day Song Jixin becomes the emperor of Great Li? You wouldn’t be able to imagine that, would you?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Absolutely not.”

The two fell silent for a moment.

Chen Ping'an suddenly remarked, “Cui Dongshan once made an interesting observation. He said the Three Teachings' sages were all attempting to find a way to slow the inexorable flow of the river of time.”

Zhu Lian became intrigued, asking curiously, “How do they intend to slow it down?”

Chen Ping'an leaned on the railing, tapping it lightly, “The celestial mountain is one entity.”

Zhu Lian was puzzled.

Chen Ping'an continued, “The mortal cities are another entity.”

He elaborated, “War is yet another entity.”

Finally, he concluded, “The myriad teachings that can immerse the heart and mind also seem to be one.”

Zhu Lian felt overwhelmed, “Cui Dongshan speaks in such a mystical manner that I’m even more confused.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “I don’t understand it either.”

Zhu Lian softly asked, “Do you wish to comprehend these profound truths?”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and shook his head, “If I can avoid understanding, then so be it.”

Zhu Lian nodded, “You’ve already learned enough, Young Master. There’s no need to probe into every matter, trying to trace everything back to its source.”

Chen Ping'an turned and said, “Zhu Lian, can you please try to tone down that habit of flattering me?”

Zhu Lian raised his arm, shaking the wine jug in hand, and laughed heartily, “Why should I change? If I do, will there still be wine to drink?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “That’s true.”

Zhu Lian tentatively asked, “You previously mentioned wanting to venture alone to the Northern Julu Continent for training. Can I not accompany you? It’ll be so dull without a cook to prepare meals or a servant to flatter you.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Just stay back at the Falling Rock Mountain. I would rather see you… improve in your martial arts. That old man Cui’s boxing technique is suitable for me, so it’s even more fitting for you. In the future, if you can reach the pinnacle of martial arts, then even if Pei Qian embarks on her first journey through the rivers and lakes, even if she travels far, or accompanies Li Huai to another continent, I’d feel at ease knowing you’re there to protect her in secret.”

Zhu Lian had to abandon the idea of persuading Chen Ping'an to change his mind.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Zhu Lian, can you share some stories from your youth?”

Zhu Lian, surprisingly bashful, replied, “Countless muddled accounts and romantic debts. If I tell these tales, I fear I’ll ruin your interest in drinking.”

Chen Ping'an jumped onto the railing and sat there, “Come on, actually, I’ve secretly read the few martial arts novels you gave Pei Qian several times. I think they’re quite well written. But they are ultimately the imagined worlds of scholars and lack the authenticity. I bet your personal experiences would be far more interesting.”

Zhu Lian also jumped onto the railing, grinning broadly, “Alright, let me recount it. You don’t know how youthful and charming I was back in the day. In those circles, how many fairy-like women and chivalrous heroines admired me to the point of being utterly infatuated!”

However, as Zhu Lian continued, he noticed that Chen Ping'an’s disapproving gaze grew more evident. Eventually, Chen Ping'an patted Zhu Lian on the shoulder and said nothing more before jumping down from the railing and leaving.

This left Zhu Lian feeling somewhat hurt.

His Young Master was good in every respect, but when it came to matters of romantic love, he was truly too upright and too different from the common folk!

Zhu Lian likely didn’t realize that as Chen Ping'an entered the building, he muttered to himself, “You have Ning girl now, you have Ning girl now. Dare to think of anything else, and you’ll be beaten to death by Ning girl without a second thought… Is it even permissible to think? No, no. Once you see Ning girl, there’s no hiding from her; she’ll see right through you in an instant and beat you half to death. Do you dare to fight back?”

 ### Chapter 426: Ziyang Manor, Sword Command Hall

A modestly decorated two-story boat glided from the turbulent waters of the Baihu River into the calm channel of the Tiequan River.

At the bow stood a striking woman in palace attire, accompanied by a close maidservant and three men of varying ages and appearances.

An elderly man sighed wryly, "Madam, our visit to Ziyang Manor may not be well-received."

He and the other two were guests at the lady's residence, having known each other for a long time. Their relationship was marked by a gentlemanly camaraderie, as light as water. Their alliances were primarily aimed at vanquishing demons and upholding justice. For instance, they had once pursued a malevolent fox spirit at Wugong Ridge based on intelligence provided by the lady, which was a far cry from the mercantile exchanges with Ziyang Manor and the Jixiang Temple.

The lady’s brow furrowed slightly, a hint of concern shadowing her features, and she let out a soft sigh.

The young maidservant, who had accompanied her for a century, though a ghostly entity, had been fortunate enough to embark on a path of cultivation after drowning under tragic circumstances. As the lady’s most trusted confidante, she dared to speak, her voice low, "The situation leaves us little choice. The Hanchijiang and Yujing Rivers have already received the peace decree from the Song clan of the Great Li dynasty, while we at the Baihu River have been left in the cold. It’s not merely due to our lack of dealings with the Great Li court; it seems that during Madam’s trip to the capital, the Emperor hinted that the Baihu River might face dire straits ahead. We cannot hope to remain untainted."

The old man frowned, "Dire straits?"

The maidservant continued, her tone somber, "The Emperor also suggested that the water god of Yujing has received a peace decree, yet he remains unsatisfied. He shamelessly went to the Piyun Mountain of the Liyu Cave Heaven, likely leveraging some hidden connections to curry favor with the North Peak's deity, Wei Bo. There’s a strong possibility that the Great Li court will take action against us at Baihu River. The already-sealed Lingyun Sect serves as a cautionary tale. The Emperor is helpless in this matter, allowing the Great Li barbarians to run amok."

The old man shook his head, "That fellow is indeed notoriously shameless."

A tall man stood a little further away, arms crossed as he gazed at the Tiequan River. Though he had successfully attained the Sixth Realm of martial arts two years prior, the current turmoil of the nation left him disheartened. This once-spirited warrior had hoped to join the border army after reaching the Sixth Realm, but now felt a sense of futility.

The marauding Great Li forces trampled across the territory of Huangting Kingdom without needing to consult the current Emperor.

What troubled him even more was the lack of righteous indignation among the officials and common folk—from scholars and officials to rural citizens and those in the Jianghu (rivers and lakes) and mountains. Few were willing to rise in protest; instead, everyone was scrambling to attach themselves to the Great Li officials stationed within Huangting. The Great Li’s seventh-rank officials held more clout than the Huangting Kingdom’s second-rank central officials, and their words carried weight.

What finally pushed the man to abandon his hopes of joining the border army was a rumor that had spread through the capital.

Years ago, while he and his friends were pursuing that fox spirit, they fell into a trap set in Wugong Ridge. The great bear demon, who was supposed to assist the fox spirit, never showed up. Instead, it callously left the fox spirit, skilled in nefarious dual cultivation, to fend for itself. This allowed them to capture the self-proclaimed Lady of Green Bud, earning great merit with the Huangting court.

The fox spirit was bound by secret techniques, stripped of most of its powers, and imprisoned in a special dungeon meant to suppress rogue cultivators and demons.

At that time, he and his friends had enjoyed a hearty drink at the Baihu River god’s residence.

Yet soon after, whispers spread throughout the capital, revealing that the fox spirit, who should have faced punishment, had been taken into the Emperor’s harem, hidden away in a gilded chamber.

The man was seething with anger.

During this visit alongside two fellow cultivators to the river god's residence, the Baihu River goddess had clearly revealed the truth to them.

The rumors were true.

In the face of national calamity, the monarch was living quite comfortably?

When the river goddess visited the Emperor, the fox spirit was indeed standing beside him, now seemingly docile. Fortunately, the restrictions placed upon it by the offering cultivators had not yet been fully lifted by the Emperor Hong.

The sight had made the river goddess, who once shared a fleeting romance with the Emperor’s ancestor, furrow her brow. In her memory, the current Emperor was not known for his lecherous ways.

But time had changed things, and he was, after all, the ruler of a nation. She felt it inappropriate to comment further.

Moreover, as a river deity, she had observed countless human follies over the years from her high perch, having witnessed the absurdities of the mundane world and grown accustomed to them.

Perhaps the current Emperor was under immense pressure. After all, while the Great Li recognized Huangting Kingdom's vassal status, who could say if one day a young member of the Song family might rise to challenge him?

In that case, how could he relieve his burdens? Perhaps only through carnal pleasures.

The river goddess understood the frustrations of the martial artist, Sun Dengxian.

Yet some things she could not voice.

Once spoken, the so-called gentlemanly friendship built over years would vanish like smoke.

The inevitable trend suggested that unless the Huangting Emperor capitulated to the Great Li barbarians, was he really willing to risk a full-scale conflict merely for the sake of reputation, striking against stone with an egg, and provoking the Great Li Song clan, inevitably leading to the easy subjugation of Huangting by the Great Li cavalry? At that point, not only would the Emperor find himself imprisoned, but how many innocent citizens of Huangting would suffer the ravages of war? Tens of thousands? Hundreds of thousands? The world turned upside down, the land in ruins, and no one in Huangting would go unscathed.

For those innocent lives, their very existence depended on a year-round assurance of food and clothing, a modest stability where warmth could be added in winter and meals supplemented during hunger.

She had insisted on visiting Ziyang Manor and brought the three men along, fully aware of Sun Dengxian's discontent. Yet she had no choice but to come.

She even needed the three of them for protection, to prevent the unpredictable ancestor of Ziyang Manor from detaining her. Having three more people, while not a definitive solution, could at least instill a bit more caution in Ziyang Manor.

The lady could only hope for a smooth and successful visit, believing that upon returning to her river god’s residence, she would reward Sun Dengxian and the others.

As they entered the Tiequan River, the atmosphere grew increasingly tense. When they passed the Jixiang River Temple, the elder river god appeared by the riverbank. As a subordinate, he first bowed to the river goddess, but his words, spoken straightened, were less than pleasant. With a smile, he asked, “Madam, it seems you are a rare visitor. I wonder what insights you have for us during your inspection of the Tiequan River? If you still wish to hold a grudge against our current naval commander, I wouldn’t dare say otherwise. But this commander is now a nominal cultivator of the Ziyang Immortal Manor. Are you intending to confront the Ziyang Immortal Manor regarding past grievances?”

The ferry continued onward, and the river goddess remained silent.

The Tiequan River god, unfazed, turned to look at the departing ferry, not missing a beat in fanning the flames as he waved energetically and shouted, “Let me share some fantastic news! Our ancestor, the Lord of Cave Spirit, is currently at the manor! As a river deity, I’m sure the Ziyang Immortal Manor will roll out the red carpet to welcome your esteemed presence, granting you the fortune of meeting the Lord’s true form. Take care, Madam! When you return to Baihu River, if you have time, do visit my Jixiang Temple!”

Once the ferry had drifted away…

The river god spat on the ground with disdain, cursing, “What a farce! Pretending to be aloof, an unknown foreign Nascent Soul who transformed into a semblance of a Baihu spirit after tossing a cup into the water. Just because she once shared a bed with the Emperor of Huangting, now she thinks she can negotiate with our esteemed Lord? She hasn’t contributed a single snowflake of tribute to our Ziyang Immortal Manor in the past few hundred years. Now she realizes her blunders? Ha! It’s a pity that our manor is currently under the direct leadership of our esteemed Lord; otherwise, this shameless woman might have crawled into the bed of the manor’s master. Who knows, she might have even…”

The river god swaggered back to the Jixiang Temple.

He suddenly swallowed hard, a sly grin spreading across his face, wondering what it would feel like to touch that golden skinned figure after she shed her palace garb.

If Baihu River did face calamity, perhaps he might just get the chance to find out?

### Ziyang Manor, Sword Command Hall

Wu Yi was nearing the limits of her patience, about to dismiss the incessantly boasting fellow clamoring for recognition and reward.

Suddenly, a steward from the outer gate stood behind the grand doors of the Sword Command Hall and respectfully announced, “Ancestor, the Baihu River goddess has come bearing gifts and wishes to pay her respects. She hopes to meet with you.”

A smile, half-sarcastic and half-amused, crept across her lips as she looked at the gathered crowd and asked, “I’ve only just arrived, and this Baihu River woman follows right behind. Did that fellow from the Jixiang Temple leak my arrival? Does he seek death?”

The others present understood that this was a sign of the ancestor’s rising anger.

In an instant, all the esteemed elders of Ziyang Manor felt a wave of anxiety wash over them.

When the ancestor was enraged, it was catastrophic; either careless outsiders faced dire consequences, or their own subordinates suffered severe repercussions.

An elder cultivator with a good relationship with the Tiequan River god stepped forward, his face resolute. “Esteemed Ancestor, the Jixiang Temple river god wouldn’t dare! His cultivation is low, and he’s incompetent in all respects. The only thing he’s truly dedicated to is his loyalty to our Ziyang Manor. Thus, I dare to speculate that upon witnessing your magnificent return from your celestial journey, the river goddess must have hurried here to seek your favor.”

She tapped her finger lightly against the armrest of her chair. “That reasoning… does seem plausible.”

Instantly, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 427: Those We Have Met

Even the elder from the Ziyang Residence, who seldom saw eye to eye with the old cultivator, couldn’t help but secretly commend him.

It wasn’t that the old cultivator was particularly righteous, willing to speak a few words of fairness for an outsider from Ziyang Residence; it was that he managed the financial dealings of the outer sect. Each year, they received unexpected income from the obedient River God of Iron Ticket.

Such matters could be significant or trivial.

Generally speaking, even if such petty and troublesome matters were to reach the ears of the esteemed True Monarch of Cave Spirit, who was wholeheartedly devoted to cultivating the Dao, she might not even bat an eyelash or utter a single harsh word.

Perhaps the informant and the poor soul being exposed would both be met with her disdain, receiving fifty lashes each before being unceremoniously tossed out of Ziyang Residence. The reasoning was simple: it would only sour her mood.

Although the ancestor was not fond of managing the secular affairs of Ziyang Residence, whenever someone provoked her anger, she would surely dig to the depths of the issue, pulling up both the carrots and the dirt. In the end, both would suffer tremendously, leaving them utterly ruined and truly unrecognizable.

Historically, several meritorious offerings from the Dragon Gate realm, known for their diligent service to Ziyang Residence, had not been lacking in either merit or toil. A few of the esteemed ancestor’s direct disciples, each with remarkable talent as Golden Core Earth Immortals, also met the same fate after an incident, being taken away by the ancestor herself and never heard from again.

Wu Yi still did not voice her opinion, casually asking, “Do you think we should meet her?”

Opinions varied among the crowd. Some argued that the River Goddess of White Heron, emboldened by her connection to the Hong clan, had never paid tribute or acknowledged Ziyang Residence. Since she dared to come here, it wouldn’t hurt to find a pretext to capture her and imprison her in the water prison beneath Ziyang Residence, then later install a compliant puppet to succeed her, achieving a win-win situation. Others countered, arguing that this Madam Xiao Luan was ultimately one of the few rightful deities of Huangting Kingdom, and with the current undercurrents in Huangting, it was best for Ziyang Residence to act cautiously. After all, as a dignified establishment, why should they clash with a neighboring river deity? Such behavior would only invite ridicule.

Wu Yi, feeling annoyed, tapped the armrest of her chair and addressed Huang Chu, the current head of the residence, “This Madam Xiao Luan does not hold enough sway for me to personally greet her. Huang Chu, go and see what she intends. If her words are displeasing, or if her offers are too low, capture her and throw her into the water prison. If she is sufficiently docile or offers a fair price, then let’s do business with her. Ziyang Residence may be large and prosperous, but who would want to go against the flow of money? If the negotiations go well, we could invite her to tonight’s welcoming banquet for Young Master Chen. Remember her seat… hmm, let’s place it nearest to the entrance.”

Huang Chu clasped his fists in acknowledgment.

Wu Yi’s gaze swept across everyone present as she smiled playfully, “What you do while I’m away is your own business, but now that I’m here at Ziyang Residence, any of you who act with selfish motives are simply treating me like a fool.”

Huang Chu, who had harbored a sly plan regarding the River Goddess Xiao Luan, whose beauty was widely renowned, had long coveted her charms. Moreover, the dual cultivation method of this river deity could greatly enhance a cultivator’s spirit. Once imprisoned in the water prison, he could gradually wear down her sharp edges and, whenever the ancestor left Ziyang Residence, he could have his way with her. However, Wu Yi’s words left him so frightened that his scalp prickled, and he quickly bowed his head again, saying, “How could Huang Chu dare to disregard the ancestor’s grace? I wouldn’t seek my own demise!”

Wu Yi smiled without warmth and said nothing further.

Huang Chu slowly exited the Sword Chastisement Hall, drenched in sweat.

The rest of the crowd, gradually leaving, couldn’t help but feel a sense of schadenfreude.

Suddenly, Wu Yi frowned, reaching out to grasp a streak of light that had pierced through the air, completely ignoring the formations of Ziyang Residence. It was a flying sword message.

Such an impressive feat could only be the work of that father of the one who had gone to become a deputy mountain master in some academy.

Upon reading the contents of the letter, Wu Yi rubbed her temples, feeling a headache and an uncontrollable anger.

With a loud bang, she smashed the armrest of the zitan dragon chair.

Hadn’t she already been sufficiently courteous? What more did they want in terms of hospitality? 
Did they expect her to treat that Chen Ping'an as if he were a revered ancestor?

Yet, just thinking of her father’s sullen expression, Wu Yi’s mood fluctuated. Finally, with a deep sigh, she resigned herself to endure this for a day or two.

---

As dusk descended, the entire Purple Qi Palace of Ziyang Residence was ablaze with lights, bright as day.

Tonight, Ziyang Residence laid out a grand banquet in the Xuemang Hall, designated for hosting distinguished guests.

Madam Xiao Luan, the River Goddess of White Heron, accompanied by her personal maid and Sun Dengxian, was led by a young female cultivator from Ziyang Residence toward the banquet.

The arrangements had been finalized, yet for some reason, Madam Xiao Luan felt that the head of the residence, Huang Chu, seemed somewhat restrained, lacking the previous vigor he displayed when appearing at various immortal estates.

Their accommodations had been placed in a secluded area of Ziyang Residence, quite far from the Purple Qi Palace that belonged to Wu Yi. Furthermore, they were attended to by a mere third-stage female disciple from the outer sect, who had not shown any courtesy to the great deity. The arrogance that permeated Ziyang Residence was evident.

Aside from Madam Xiao Luan, her maid and Sun Dengxian both wore expressions of displeasure, though Madam Xiao Luan remained serene.

Then something even more outrageous occurred, causing the maid and Sun Dengxian to lose their composure, each letting out a cold huff.

After gingerly entering the doors of Purple Qi Palace, the third-stage female cultivator, trembling with fear, explained the general route to the guests. Then she stated that Madam Xiao Luan could find her way to the Xuemang Hall from there, as it would be easy to spot, just by the entrance.

Madam Xiao Luan comforted her companions, but seeing it had little effect, she could only force a smile and proceed ahead.

As they rounded a screen wall, they encountered another group of people.

It was none other than Chen Ping'an and his companions, who had previously been invited by an old cultivator from the Dragon Gate realm. However, Chen Ping'an had asked for directions and opted not to trouble the elder to guide him, stating he could manage on his own. The elder, who held the power of life and death over all the fifth-stage cultivators in Ziyang Residence, had initially insisted, but recalling the earlier words of the ancestor from the Sword Chastisement Hall, he felt it best to acquiesce to this young master Chen and excused himself to attend to his own matters.

The two groups crossed paths at the intersection of two corridors.

Chen Ping'an stepped forward first, allowing Madam Xiao Luan and her entourage to pass.

Madam Xiao Luan smiled and nodded, acknowledging the courtesy of the stranger.

A young man in white with a long sword slung across his back in Purple Qi Palace?
Madam Xiao Luan didn’t think much of it.

Her personal maid couldn’t help but steal another glance at Chen Ping'an, noticing a small vermilion wine flask hanging at his waist.

He looked quite like an inner sect disciple of Ziyang Residence, yet he lacked the arrogance typical of their cultivators. 
Sun Dengxian, walking at the back, was too preoccupied with his own gloomy thoughts to notice Chen Ping'an and his group.

Suddenly, he heard someone call out, “Hero?!”

Sun Dengxian ignored it and continued on.

But the voice persisted, “Hero! At Centipede Ridge, in front of the dilapidated temple, we’ve met before.”

Sun Dengxian paused, turning his head to look at the beaming young man in white, “Who are you?”

Chen Ping'an quickly stepped up to Sun Dengxian, smiling, “Hero, do you remember? At the dilapidated temple, I was with two little ones, one in green and one in a pink dress. After you defeated the demon, you kindly reminded me to be careful, saying not everyone from the mountains would be indifferent to having transformed demons around.”

Sun Dengxian’s face lit up as he burst into hearty laughter, “Oh, so it’s you!”

Chen Ping'an scratched his head, feeling a bit shy, “It’s normal that you wouldn’t recognize me; I’ve grown a lot in the past two years and changed my clothes.”

Sun Dengxian gave Chen Ping'an a hearty pat on the shoulder, “Good lad, not bad at all! You’ve made quite a name for yourself, dining and drinking at Purple Qi Palace now! I reckon our seats won’t be too far apart; we should have a drink together later.”

Chen Ping'an merely smiled and nodded.

Back at Centipede Ridge, this man had wielded a silver knife as a talisman, helping to hunt down a fox demon that had transformed into a beautiful woman. He had nearly clashed with a group of aristocratic youths traveling the rivers and lakes, but in the end, it was this man who subdued the ruthless fox demon, who called herself Lady Qingya.

Chen Ping'an remembered that encounter vividly.

One could say that his vague impressions of the jianghu and what it meant to be a hero, to subdue demons and protect the innocent, were shaped by that chance meeting and observation.

To unexpectedly meet again in Ziyang Residence with this decisive man filled Chen Ping'an with delight.

However, he was so caught up in his joy that he barely noticed the change in expression on Pei Qian’s face as she stared wide-eyed.

That unknown Huangting Kingdom warrior of the sixth stage, the force behind that slap…

This scene brought a smile to Zhu Lian’s face, while Shi Rou’s eyelids twitched. She thought that if Cui Dongshan were here, this reckless jianghu ruffian would likely be in big trouble.

Madam Xiao Luan, walking behind Sun Dengxian, also heard the commotion and came to a halt. Sun Dengxian turned to them, laughing as he introduced Chen Ping'an, “This young brother is the lad I mentioned to you, young as he is, his martial intent is quite impressive, and he’s incredibly bold. Back then, he only had three or four realms of martial cultivation but dared to roam the jianghu with two little demons. Compared to those pampered aristocrats, this young hero here has much more practical experience…”

Madam Xiao Luan, elegant and beautiful, wore a smile again, but her maid had already signaled to Sun Dengxian with her eyes, urging him to hasten to the Xuemang Hall to avoid further complications.

An elder quietly reminded, “Young Sun, you can chat while walking.”

Sun Dengxian felt a bit disgruntled, but luckily Chen Ping'an smiled, “The banquet is important. Is your surname Sun? I’m Chen Ping'an. You can just call me Chen Ping'an, Hero Sun.”

Sun Dengxian, being a naturally bold and free-spirited wanderer, didn’t hold back, “Alright, I’ll call you Chen Ping'an.”

Madam Xiao Luan continued on her way.

Sun Dengxian lingered behind to chat amiably with Chen Ping'an.

At the end of the corridor, a scolding voice suddenly rang out, “What’s going on? Do you expect our ancestor and the head of the residence to wait for you to take your seats before the banquet starts? Madam Xiao Luan, you really have a grand sense of entitlement!”

It was a haughty inner sect steward of Ziyang Residence, rushing into the corridor, completely disregarding the River Goddess.

After the reprimand, the steward turned on his heel and walked away, “Hurry up, enough with the dawdling!”

Once the steward turned away, Madam Xiao Luan narrowed her eyes and let out a breath, her expression returning to normal.

Sun Dengxian muttered a curse under his breath.

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

All the fifth-stage cultivators of Ziyang Residence had gathered in the Xuemang Hall.

As Madam Xiao Luan stepped outside the threshold of the great hall, she slowed her pace, feeling an unsettling sensation creeping up her spine.

The steward stood at the entrance, glaring at the River Goddess, lowering his voice, “Why are you not entering to sit down quickly?”

Madam Xiao Luan’s face remained impassive as she crossed the threshold, followed by her maid and those two jianghu friends. The steward might have felt inclined to insult the River Goddess, but for the other insignificant figures that followed, he could only scoff disdainfully.

However, upon seeing Sun Dengxian, who had a close relationship with someone, the steward’s smile froze, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead.

Sun Dengxian looked confused, utterly unaware of what was happening as he boldly crossed the threshold.

Chen Ping'an, who was a step slower entering the Xuemang Hall, maintained his usual demeanor.

 ### Chapter 428: Night Rain in the Jianghu

Madam Xiao Luan and her three companions took their seats, indeed positioned closest to the threshold of Xue Mang Hall, perfect for enjoying the night scenery outside.

As for her personal maid, known as the "Little Water Deity" because of her connection to the enchanting rivers and mountains of the Bai Hu Jiang district, the Ziyang Manor didn’t even spare her a seat.

Thus, the maid had no choice but to stand behind Madam Xiao Luan, her delicate face as frosty as the night air.

For the past two hundred years, after being drowned and transformed into a water ghost, she had been meticulously promoted by Madam Xiao Luan to the position of Overseer of the Water Deity's Bureau in Bai Hu Jiang. With the authority to take out lower-tier cultivators and demons causing trouble in the region, she had never suffered such humiliation before. This visit to Ziyang Manor felt like throwing away all the prestige she had accumulated over the years, and in this manor, there was no hope of reclaiming it.

Fortunately, having been by Madam Xiao Luan's side for so long, she had learned to gauge the situation. Without needing her mistress to remind her to be mindful of the occasion, she had already lowered her gaze early on, striving to appear composed and natural, daring not to show the slightest hint of discontent. Earlier, after Madam Xiao Luan had a private discussion with the current head of the Ziyang Manor, Huang Chu, the mood of Madam Xiao Luan had not lightened, and she had reminded her companions that there were still uncertainties to navigate before they could return to the Water Deity's Bureau, urging everyone to bear with it a little longer.

At that moment, Madam Xiao Luan had looked quite remorseful, her expression bitter, and her words even carried a hint of pleading, which nearly brought tears to the maid's eyes.

Now, Madam Xiao Luan’s appearance—from her looks and attire to her posture—was nearly flawless, but there was a certain obscurity in her gaze.

She had managed to establish her authority over Bai Hu Jiang, extending its territory from the original six hundred li to nearly nine hundred. Her power rivaled that of a high-ranking official in the secular court, and she maintained close relationships with many prominent celestial masters of Huang Ting Kingdom and renowned martial artists like Sun Dengxian, a feat not achievable solely through force.

She was the first among the two groups to enter the banquet hall. With the hall filled with guests and deities, only two seats remained unoccupied. Since the guests from the Bai Hu Jiang Water Deity's Bureau had already been informed they would be seated in the cool spot near the threshold, Madam Xiao Luan had no trouble discerning who the remaining seats, the most prestigious ones below the main seat, were reserved for.

As expected, she saw Chen Ping’an entering Xue Mang Hall, and the lazy figure of Wu Yi sitting at the main seat—the founder of Ziyang Manor whom even Madam Xiao Luan would prefer to avoid meeting.

To her surprise, Wu Yi stood up with a smile, descended the steps, and approached Chen Ping’an, linking her arm with his as she laughed, “Young Master Chen, we wouldn’t dare start the feast without your presence in Xue Mang Hall!”

With a body already honed through years of martial practice, Chen Ping’an felt a sudden awkwardness as an unfamiliar woman wrapped her arm around his. It was a struggle to not break free from Wu Yi’s affectionate gesture in front of everyone, making the moment excruciating.

Inside Ziyang Manor, the great cultivators felt their minds wavering more than ever, increasingly convinced that this young man named Chen was either Wu Yi's secret lover or possibly a royal relative of the Song family from the Great Li Dynasty who had traveled here. 

Otherwise, Wu Yi's behavior at this banquet was far too peculiar.

Fortunately, after Wu Yi guided Chen Ping’an to a seat, she discreetly released him and returned to the main seat, maintaining a familiar demeanor towards him as she addressed him brightly, “Young Master Chen, our Ziyang Manor may not boast much, but our Old Jiao's Temptation Wine is famous far and wide, and it’s no mere boast. Even an emperor from the Great Sui Dynasty, the Ge family’s elder, has privately requested our Ziyang Manor for sixty jars every year! The wine is already prepared on the tables. Once we finish, servants will bring more to ensure no one’s cup goes empty tonight. Let us drink to our hearts’ content; we shall not return until we are all thoroughly drunk!”

Dozens of young female cultivators, dressed in vibrant new attire, began to serve wine and dishes from both sides of Xue Mang Hall, fluttering about like colorful butterflies, creating a dazzling display.

Wu Yi was the first to stand and raise her glass. “This first cup of wine is dedicated to Young Master Chen for gracing our Ziyang Manor; may our humble abode shine with your presence!”

At this, everyone had no choice but to rise together, lifting their cups in a toast to Chen Ping’an.

In Huang Ting Kingdom, such face-saving gestures were of utmost importance.

Perhaps even Emperor Hong’s presence at the Purple Qi Palace would not garner such treatment from Wu Yi.

After Chen Ping’an and his companions took their seats, Sun Dengxian found himself momentarily stunned, sitting in place until his friend nudged him, prompting him to quickly rise.

Chen Ping’an could only express his gratitude and down a cup of wine.

On the small table before Pei Qian sat two jars of Old Jiao's Temptation Wine, but the Ziyang Manor had thoughtfully prepared a jar of sweet fruit wine for her, which made her quite cheerful as she lifted her cup.

Ziyang Manor truly was a lovely place.

Pei Qian resolved to discuss this with her master later, hoping to convince him to visit Ziyang Manor more often. Though Wu Yi wasn’t particularly handsome—far less so than Huang Ting or Yao Jin—she was kind and warm in her hospitality, leaving no room for complaints! After all, it wasn’t as if they needed to bring her home as his wife; looks didn’t matter.

Afterward, Wu Yi didn’t focus too much on Chen Ping’an, and the banquet proceeded as any ordinary celestial gathering would.

Delicious dishes and delicacies were served one after another by the graceful young female cultivators, adding to the festive atmosphere of Xue Mang Hall.

Huang Chu, the manor’s deputy leader, proved to be quite the conversationalist, leading the toasts to Wu Yi with eloquent words that earned him cheers from the crowd.

Wu Yi spoke little, but compared to past banquets at Ziyang Manor, her demeanor was notably more approachable tonight, almost like a different person. She even shared a few amusing stories from the mountains that had everyone laughing, despite Wu Yi’s usual serious nature. If Huang Chu had shared those tales, he might have rivaled a storyteller, but hearing them from Wu Yi, they didn’t strike Chen Ping’an as particularly funny. Still, the laughter in Xue Mang Hall was sincere and joyous.

Perhaps this was what the Jianghu was truly about.

Chen Ping’an had first felt such sentiments after a grand battle in the ethereal Lotus Flower Paradise, when he encountered the emperor of the Southern Garden Kingdom at a tavern.

Holding a wine cup, Madam Xiao Luan slowly stood up.

Everyone instinctively quieted, the hall falling silent.

Madam Xiao Luan smiled and said, “Xiao Luan raises a glass for the honor of Lord Yuanjun.”

Wu Yi feigned disinterest but kept her gaze fixed on Madam Xiao Luan.

Her posture clearly indicated that she had no intention of giving the Bai Hu Jiang Water Deity’s Bureau any face; Madam Xiao Luan wouldn’t gain even a shred of dignity in Ziyang Manor.

Sun Dengxian nearly exploded with anger, clenching his fists on the table, his entire body trembling.

Wu Yi subtly cast a glance at Chen Ping’an, who was whispering to Pei Qian, likely advising her on proper etiquette as a guest, reminding her to sit and eat decorously and not to lose herself just because they were drinking fruit wine instead of liquor. Pei Qian straightened her posture but shook her head, grinning as she reassured him she understood, only to receive a light tap on the head from Chen Ping’an.

Seeing Chen Ping’an’s disinterest, Wu Yi quickly averted her gaze, stifling a yawn. She held a jar of Old Jiao's Temptation Wine, gently swaying it, and resting her chin on her hand, lazily asked, “Bai Hu Jiang? Where is that?”

Then she turned to Huang Chu and inquired, “How far is it from our Ziyang Manor?”

Huang Chu promptly stood up and respectfully replied, “Returning to the esteemed ancestor, Bai Hu Jiang Water Deity's Bureau is only three hundred li along the Iron Link River from us.”

Wu Yi pretended to be enlightened, “Oh, that’s not far at all.”

Not far at all; even as neighbors, the saying goes that a distant relative is not as good as a close neighbor. For celestial masters and deity spirits, three hundred li indeed felt like just a short distance, akin to a leisurely stroll after a meal. Given that, the way the Bai Hu Jiang Water Deity's Bureau had been acting aloof from Ziyang Manor over the past few centuries appeared to Wu Yi as a direct provocation from Madam Xiao Luan.

However, Wu Yi had her own plans regarding this matter, allowing the Bai Hu Jiang Water Deity's Bureau to expand without interference, not once instructing the cultivators of Ziyang Manor or the Iron Link River’s Temple of Accumulated Fragrance to obstruct them.

Within the warm Xue Mang Hall, a sudden chill swept through the atmosphere.

Madam Xiao Luan held her wine cup in both hands, her exquisitely beautiful face maintaining a serene smile, “I hope the Cave Spirit Yuanjun can forgive my transgression; I, Xiao Luan, shall take a self-punishment shot.”

Just as Madam Xiao Luan raised her arm, Wu Yi abruptly extended her palm, pressing down lightly, “Xiao Luan, a small Ziyang Manor hardly deserves a penalty drink from a river goddess. Huang Chu, as the manor’s leader, should have taken the initiative to visit the Water Deity’s Bureau when she didn’t come to you. Do you need this river goddess to approach you? I see your attitude as the manor leader rivals that of Emperor Hong’s. Hurry up, what are you waiting for? Stand up and give the river goddess a toast. No, Huang Chu, you should drink three cups yourself.”

Without a word, Huang Chu faced Madam Xiao Luan and downed three cups of wine.

The atmosphere in Xue Mang Hall had grown so tense that one could hear a pin drop.

Madam Xiao Luan held onto the cup of wine she hadn’t had the chance to drink, and after bending down to set it aside, she made a strange gesture by lifting two jars of wine from the tables of the two elderly men and Sun Dengxian, placing the three jars before herself. She picked one up, removed the clay seal, and holding the jar, which must have contained around three pounds of wine, addressed Wu Yi, “The Bai Hu Jiang Water Deity’s Bureau has already toasted Huang Chu three cups; this is an act of generosity from the Ziyang Manor not to fuss over a mere woman like me. However, I also wish to drink three jars of penalty wine to apologize to Lord Yuanjun, and at the same time, I wish for you to ascend to the upper five realms and for Ziyang Manor to establish its sect!”

Next, Madam Xiao Luan astonishingly suppressed her divine energy, basically withdrawing the power of the Bai Hu Jiang Water Deity, temporarily taking on the form of a regular martial artist, and with a single breath, downed all three jars of wine.

With her face flushed, as she lifted the wine jar three times and tilted her head back to drink, some wine inevitably spilled, soaking the front of her magnificent attire, and she quickly turned away, covering her mouth with her hand.

Pei Qian gaped at the bold woman, thinking that even for herself, not to mention three jars, she couldn’t even handle a small jar of fruit wine!

Hastily, she poured herself a cup of fruit wine, preparing to calm her nerves.

Chen Ping’an smiled softly at Pei Qian, “That should be enough.”

Wu Yi, once again eyeing Chen Ping’an, turned her head towards the Bai Hu Jiang Water Deity, who still stood without taking her seat, nodding, “We’ve drunk to each other; you’ve taken your penalty drink as well, good. We’re practically family now, so remember to visit often during the holidays. But I must remind you, Madam Xiao Luan, that you owe this opportunity to Young Master Chen; shouldn’t you show some gratitude?”

Madam Xiao Luan was clearly feeling quite uncomfortable, her breathing rapid, but she managed a picturesque smile, “Of course, I shall drink another jar. As Lord Yuanjun said, such opportunities are rare, and we must not leave until we are drunk! With a beautiful night and exquisite wine, I, Xiao Luan, would never dare to disappoint; I just hope that if I lose my composure when drunk, Lord Yuanjun won’t laugh at me…”

As she spoke, she lifted another jar of wine, her fingers trembling slightly as she removed the seal.

After Chen Ping’an stood up, holding his wine cup and glancing at the Bai Hu Jiang Water Deity holding the wine jar, he looked down at his own cup and suddenly turned to Wu Yi at the main seat, smiling, “Lord Yuanjun, my alcohol tolerance is average; how about I share a cup with the river goddess? Otherwise, if I drink one cup, while the river goddess drinks a whole jar, I simply cannot justify it. I wouldn’t want to trouble Ziyang Manor again, nor feel hesitant to visit the river goddess next time I pass by.”

Wu Yi’s expression darkened, shaking the wine jar with a smile, “Young Master Chen, that won’t do! Xiao Luan has toasted me three jars, yet only shares a cup with you—how does that make sense? That’s too unreasonable. What, Young Master Chen is feeling protective of the fair lady? How coincidental, with wine as a matchmaker, our Madam Xiao Luan has been alone for many years. Young Master Chen is indeed a dragon among men…”

Chen Ping’an quickly interrupted Wu Yi’s increasingly unfounded chatter, lifting a jar of wine and unsealing it, as if pleading with Wu Yi, “Lord Yuanjun, I can’t argue with you; I accept my penalty. Half a jar of penalty wine, and the remaining half will be my toast to the river goddess.”

Wu Yi suddenly burst into laughter.

And so, Xue Mang Hall erupted once more with hearty laughter.

Facing the main seat, Chen Ping’an downed half a jar of wine in one go, then turned to Madam Xiao Luan, raising the remaining half jar high, “A toast to the river goddess!”

Madam Xiao Luan drank it all in one gulp.

This time, forgetting all decorum, she quickly returned to her seat, turning away to press her arm against her mouth.

After the farce, the banquet resumed its lively atmosphere.

The decorated female cultivators busily circulated about, pouring wine.

Some guests had already left their seats, moving about to toast one another.

After all, this time, many cultivators from the five realms had gathered in Ziyang Manor, and many of them had come from nearby cultivation caves. The practice of observing the ocean and Dragon Gate was particularly focused on the principle of perseverance, making it quite common for true cultivators who had stepped into the fold to go years or even decades without seeing each other. If they were to reach the legendary Nascent Soul stage, their existence would be as tranquil as a dragon hidden among the clouds.

The maid bent down to gently pat Madam Xiao Luan on the back, but was immediately shaken off by her, causing the maid to quickly withdraw her hand, silent as a mouse.

With tipsy eyes, Madam Xiao Luan, even more enchanting and radiant, whispered to Sun Dengxian, “Dengxian, why don’t you go have a drink with your friends?”

Sun Dengxian’s face showed signs of distress.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 429: Madam, Please Conduct Yourself with Dignity

Madam Xiao Luan, perhaps due to the effects of alcohol, was unlike her usual poised and dignified self. At this moment, she appeared somewhat like a coy young woman, casting a pitiful glance towards Sun Dengxian.

Sun Dengxian felt somewhat helpless. He held nothing but respect for this goddess of the River Jiang, yet how could any hero remain unmoved in the presence of such beauty, with her furrowed brow and captivating gaze? How many could maintain their iron hearts in such a scene?

Reluctantly, Sun Dengxian nodded and stood up, raising his cup as he prepared to toast Chen Ping’an.

Despite his strong-willed nature, Sun Dengxian was aware of Chen Ping’an’s esteemed status as a top noble of the Ziyang Manor. Even the venerable Wu Yi sought to curry favor with such a guest. In his memory, Chen Ping’an had once been a youthful wanderer of the third or fourth realm whom they had encountered in the Jianghu (rivers and lakes). Now that they had crossed paths again, it was only natural for Chen Ping’an to come and toast him. Sun Dengxian would have gladly sought him out for a few words. However, now he felt oddly ill at ease, his bold spirit vanished.

Sun Dengxian froze.

Before him stood the young man in white, a sword slung across his back, accompanied by a lively girl with a complexion as dark as coal.

“Sun Daxia (Hero Sun), I toast you,” Chen Ping’an said as he approached.

Though Sun Dengxian had been somewhat shy earlier, seeing Chen Ping’an made him feel a flicker of joy. It was rare for this trip to Ziyang Manor, which had been so frustrating, to yield even a slight moment of comfort. He smiled as he stood facing Chen Ping’an, clinking their cups together and downing their drinks. When Chen Ping’an lowered his cup slightly, Sun Dengxian felt it was inappropriate, so he followed suit. Yet, Chen Ping’an lowered his cup further, prompting Sun Dengxian to finally relent.

After finishing his drink, having already been drinking alone in solitude, Sun Dengxian felt a bit tipsy. Words that had been on the tip of his tongue slipped out: “Chen Ping’an, where did you learn such table manners? They’re rather vulgar! Besides, I’m not worthy of such courtesy.”

Madam Xiao Luan had already risen from her seat. The two water deity friends of the elder, witnessing Sun Dengxian’s disregard for decorum, were left speechless.

Chen Ping’an’s eyes sparkled. “Sun Daxia, you are worthy!”

Sun Dengxian chuckled. “Didn’t you just catch a fox demon? Is that why you can’t seem to forget it?”

Chen Ping’an refrained from sharing his thoughts about the Jianghu but picked up a wine jar from a nearby table, pouring himself a cup and filling Sun Dengxian's as well. He grinned, “In the narrow paths of the mortal world, the wine cup is wide. Let’s drink another one together!”

The two drank deeply once more. Sun Dengxian laughed heartily, “You’ve got quite the talent for toasting!”

Chen Ping’an smiled back, his face flushed after downing a jar of strong old dragon’s drool wine.

After bidding farewell to Sun Dengxian, there was no lengthy exchange of pleasantries, nor did he engage in idle chatter with Madam Xiao Luan.

Before leaving, Chen Ping’an glanced toward the entrance.

The steward, who could only wait at the threshold, had been anxiously watching Chen Ping’an and Madam Xiao Luan. Upon catching Chen Ping’an’s gaze, he immediately lowered his head and bowed obsequiously.

Chen Ping’an smiled, raising his empty cup before returning to his seat.

The steward, having received this sign, was so overwhelmed with emotion that he nearly wept.

Madam Xiao Luan sat back down, lowering her head to gently wipe wine stains from her attire, exhaling a breath laced with both exhalation and the scent of alcohol.

What was more terrifying than being forced to drink copious amounts of punitive wine was being denied even the chance to lift a cup to drink a few sips.

The maid watched the young man's departing figure, feeling a mix of gratitude after a moment of contemplation.

Pei Qian raised her head, curiously asking, “That old man seems to look down on everyone, doesn’t he? Master, aren’t you angry?”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “What’s there to be angry about?”

Pei Qian whispered, “You’re thinking of Sun Daxia and the others, right?”

Chen Ping’an gave her a light pat on the head. “You’re quite clever.”

Just a few steps away from their seats, Pei Qian grabbed Chen Ping’an’s gentle hand. He looked at her curiously. “What’s wrong?”

With a grin, she said, “I want to soak up the good vibes from my master and the essence of the Jianghu.”

Chen Ping’an laughed, “Indeed, it’s rare to find a master like me to tag along for food and drink.”

Pei Qian cautiously asked, “Master, can I have just a tiny bit of the old dragon’s drool wine? It smells so good, it’s driving me crazy!”

Chen Ping’an inquired, “What do you think?”

Pei Qian nodded vigorously. “I think I could manage a small cup. I want to experience the narrow paths of the mortal world and the wide wine cup!”

Chen Ping’an playfully tugged her ear and set her down on her little embroidered stool. “Drink your fruit brew.”

Just as Chen Ping’an was about to sit down, Wu Yi had already descended from the main seat and approached him. She waved her hand, signaling for the suddenly silent Xue Mang Hall to continue drinking. Once the raucous atmosphere returned,

Wu Yi asked telepathically, “Young Master Chen, have you slain many dragons and similar creatures?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head.

The battle at Jiao Long Valley wasn’t fought by him; he hadn’t killed that old dragon himself.

Suddenly recalling the yellow eel monster at the borders of the Daqian Dynasty in Tongye Continent, he had been the one to slay it from start to finish. Chen Ping’an frowned, asking, “Did the Yuanjun notice something?”

Wu Yi felt a flicker of displeasure upon seeing Chen Ping’an shake his head. However, thinking of the two letters that held more weight than any imperial decree, she patiently explained, “I can’t pry into your past, but I can see that you carry quite a bit of karma.”

Chen Ping’an asked curiously, “How so?”

Wu Yi smiled. “Some monsters in this world, killing them can lead to merit, but they may also bring karma. This unusual principle is something Confucianism tends to avoid discussing, so you might not be aware of it, Young Master Chen.”

Chen Ping’an asked straightforwardly, “Is there a way to resolve or eliminate it?”

Wu Yi teased him, “No need to rush. After all, you’ll be staying at Ziyang Manor for another day or two. Once the alcohol wears off, I’ll discuss this with you. For tonight, let’s just enjoy the wine and not bring up such dreary topics.”

All good things must come to an end.

Wu Yi took her leave first.

Chen Ping’an soon followed with Pei Qian and the others, retracing their steps.

Pei Qian was still very excited, not forgetting to take her hiking staff along, humming a self-composed song all the way, filled with local dialect from her hometown in Longquan County, “Today the thunder sings a tune, tomorrow it won’t rain much. Swallows fly low, snakes cross the path, ants move homes while the mountain wears a hat… The moon has grown fur, heavy rains flood the ditch. The sky is filled with carp spots, tomorrow the grain will dry without flipping…”

She was relentless.

Zhu Lian had heard this song so many times that his ears were starting to feel sore. He pleaded, “Miss Pei, can you spare my ears for once?”

Pei Qian sighed, in a great mood tonight, she decided to let the old cook have his way. She dashed a few steps ahead on the quiet road, waving her hiking staff, “The wild dogs run rampant, and the wolves take the lead, making the Jianghu a dangerous place, where everyone is on edge. But I haven’t mastered the ultimate swordsmanship and knife techniques, it’s all my fault—blame me!”

Zhu Lian kicked her from behind.

Pei Qian stumbled a few steps but regained her balance, turning around angrily, “What’s that for?”

Zhu Lian was about to mock her when he suddenly exclaimed, looking up, “Is it raining?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Yes.”

Indeed, a gentle rain began to fall.

The group quickened their pace back to the Treasure Vault.

Shi Rou, being an otherworldly entity, required no sleep and had been guarding the first floor.

Zhu Lian and Pei Qian stayed on the second and third floors, respectively.

Chen Ping’an stood alone in the corridor on the fourth floor, the rain tonight was light.

He practiced his stance in the corridor for half an hour, dissipating the alcohol that lingered in his system.

Afterward, Chen Ping’an returned to his room to sleep. His sleep was light, especially being in Ziyang Manor, where the enigmatic Wu Yi resided.

In the latter half of the night, a soft knock echoed at the door.

Chen Ping’an got dressed and opened the door, only to find someone he could never have anticipated.

Madam Xiao Luan, the goddess of the River Baihu.

Her eyes were complex, filled with shyness, as if she wanted to say something but hesitated. She seemed to have changed into an even more fitting dress, turning her head slightly, biting her lip, gathering her courage to whisper, “Young Master Chen…”

Chen Ping’an immediately slammed the door shut.

Madam Xiao Luan stood outside, her face in shock.

Inside, the young man’s voice rang out, furious, “Madam, please conduct yourself with dignity!”

Madam Xiao Luan stood frozen outside the door, lingering for a long while. As she hesitated about whether to knock again, she turned to see an inconspicuous hunchbacked old man.

On the corridor leading to the Xue Mang Hall’s banquet, Madam Xiao Luan had a keen eye for observing others. Upon first encountering this man, she noted every detail from the rhythm of his breaths to the sounds of his footsteps, hidden deep within. He had deliberately maintained his cultivation at the fifth realm of martial arts, but now this old fellow’s sudden appearance on the fourth floor exuded a martial presence almost on par with Sun Dengxian.

Clearly, this was someone with a deep understanding of strategy.

Madam Xiao Luan could tell this elderly attendant was a martial artist surpassing Sun Dengxian, but whether he had already reached the Golden Body realm and begun his ascent to the ultimate peak of martial arts, she could not discern.

Not being able to gauge the depth of a purely martial figure meant she had to be cautious around him.

The hunchbacked old man smiled, causing Madam Xiao Luan to feel a chill run down her spine. His words made her feel utterly uncomfortable. “Madam Xiao Luan, you were turned away by my young master? Don’t take it to heart; my young master is always like this, not just towards you.”

Madam Xiao Luan composed herself, forcing a smile, “Old sir, it suddenly rained tonight. You know I’m a river deity, so naturally, I feel a sense of closeness. It’s not easy to dissipate the wine fumes; I thought to take this opportunity to stroll through the Ziqi Palace. By chance, I saw your young master practicing his punches upstairs. I initially thought Young Master Chen was a cultivator, a promising little swordsman. I never expected his martial intent to be so superb, rivaling any Jianghu master of our Huangting Kingdom. Out of curiosity, I rudely came to visit. I hope I haven’t overstepped.”

Zhu Lian interjected grandiosely, “Not at all! In this world, only the foolish don’t understand the subtleties of interaction. Whatever a beauty says or does is never overstepping!”

Madam Xiao Luan didn’t wish to engage with him any further. The events of the night were destined to end without resolution, and she saw no reason to stay and waste time here.

Besides, did she really think herself devoid of any shame? As the goddess of the third-largest river in Huangting Kingdom, she was hardly inferior to the deities of the country’s five sacred mountains. If not for Wu Yi and the overwhelming authority of Ziyang Manor, which had now aligned itself with the Great Li Dynasty, Madam Xiao Luan would have received the same treatment as any other gathering in Huangting Kingdom tonight.

Thus, after a few polite exchanges, Madam Xiao Luan intended to take her leave.

In Ziyang Manor, everything had gone awry, and leaving the Treasure Vault tonight would still present her with a headache waiting ahead.

Zhu Lian grinned, “Madam, please stay.”

Madam Xiao Luan was furious inside, yet her regal demeanor remained intact. She asked, “Old sir, is there something you need? If it’s not urgent, we can discuss it tomorrow.”

Zhu Lian waved a hand, “What do you mean old sir? Compared to the endless years of Madam Xiao Luan, I’m just a slightly older-looking youth. You can call me Little Zhu, the one with green hair and a radiant face. It’s not urgent; I merely lacked the courage to toast to you at the Xue Mang Hall. Now that it’s quiet, with no outsiders around, I was hoping to share the excitement of a night stroll through Ziyang Manor with you. What do you say, Madam?”

Madam Xiao Luan felt more nauseous than after drinking four jars of old dragon’s drool wine.

Still smiling, she replied, “It’s late, and I need to depart Ziyang Manor early tomorrow to return to the Baihu River. I’m a bit tired and would like to rest early. I hope you understand.”

Zhu Lian strode forward, “Of course, I understand, Madam! Allow me to escort you back. I can’t bear to let you return alone. You are a paragon of beauty. Even if the guards of Ziyang Manor were to cast their eyes upon you, I’d be distressed. No, no, you don’t need to worry about me; I must accompany you!”

Madam Xiao Luan forced a smile. With her level of composure, she was on the verge of uttering harsh words.

Turning away, she neither rejected nor accepted Zhu Lian’s offer and dashed out of the building, her graceful figure turning into a rainbow as she took flight.

Unexpectedly, Zhu Lian appeared by her side in an instant, soaring alongside her!

Madam Xiao Luan’s heart raced, nearly causing her to stumble.

A figure of the far-reaching realm!
This old lecher is, surprisingly, a pure martial artist at the eighth realm?! 
The number one martial artist renowned in Huangting Kingdom’s Jianghu for over forty years was merely at the Golden Body realm.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 430: Proceed with Caution

Zhu Lian followed closely beside Madam Xiao Luan. "Madam, I once read in a book that in this world, when the dragon spirits of the rivers and lakes become emotionally stirred, they bring forth a gentle rain upon the land. Is there any truth to that?"

Madam Xiao Luan's anger simmered beneath her embarrassment; she loathed the orchestrator of this situation and would have gladly hurled this old man into the depths of Baihu River, extracting his soul and twisting it into wicks for lanterns to illuminate the water palace!

Zhu Lian babbled on, oblivious to her ire. “To stroll through Ziyang Palace at night with Madam Xiao Luan is truly a great joy in life! I confess without fear of ridicule that I, Zhu Lian, have always enjoyed writing travelogues, chronicling the wonders and oddities of the world. Tonight, being fortunate enough to accompany you, I must describe this experience in vivid detail in my travelogue. Once published, I will personally deliver a copy to you!”

Madam Xiao’s teeth ground together in frustration, her breath quickening. The attire she wore tonight felt excessively revealing, having been forced upon her by that man.

Zhu Lian glanced at the majestic scenery that stretched before them, quickly turning his gaze toward the Iron Ticket River, exclaiming, “What a splendid view!”

---

Zhu Lian had long since returned to his second-floor abode.

Inside the Treasure Pavilion, Chen Ping’an had lost all desire for sleep. He lit a lamp and began flipping through books. After a while, he sighed, recalling a line from a novel about wandering knights: “Heroes can’t escape the allure of beauty.” This river goddess was far too… unprincipled in the ways of the martial world! Snowy Hall had helped her once, yet she repaid him by putting him in such a predicament! He had heard that a true knight would not harbor grudges overnight, resolving conflicts the same night. And here she was, repaying kindness like this? Damn it! If it weren’t for the worry that Zhu Lian might misunderstand and think he was hiding something, he would have slapped her!

Chen Ping’an wiped the sweat from his forehead, grumbling about the river goddess of Baihu River.

In the end, he had no choice but to find some comfort for himself: “The journey through the Lotus Flower Blessed Land wasn’t in vain. If this had happened earlier, I might have foolishly opened the door for her.”

Gradually calming down, Chen Ping’an focused again on his reading. He had borrowed six books from the library at the Cliffside Academy, including texts from Confucianism, Buddhism, Daoism, and the Mo School. The Master of Maoshan had told him not to rush to return them; he could send them back whenever he felt he had thoroughly understood them.

Suddenly, he closed the book, stepped out of the room, and walked to the railing of the corridor.

Unforeseen events often herald strange occurrences.

Outside, the rain had stopped, and the night was heavy.

Chen Ping’an pressed his hand against the railing, walking slowly, the remnants of raindrops mingling in his palm, cool to the touch.

He opened his hand, looking down.

He hopped onto the railing, slowly moving forward, gazing into the distance at the Iron Ticket River outside Ziyang Palace, beyond which lay green mountains.

He stood high in the Treasure Pavilion of Ziyang Palace within Huangting Kingdom, beneath the eaves of the railing.

His thoughts drifted far away.

He recalled his recent journey to Qingluan Kingdom, where he had listened to the local patrons discuss the debate between Buddhism and Daoism, sparked by the tale of a monk holding an umbrella outside while a Confucian scholar sheltered from the rain beneath an eave.

When traveling and encountering rain, one naturally seeks refuge under an eave.

He remembered Lu Tai's lament in the courtyard of Flying Eagle Fortress that human regrets often stem from the impossibility of “holding on.” The deepest sentiments usually boiled down to a reminder to proceed with caution amidst various landscapes and people.

Lu Tai had also said that it was difficult for us to truly empathize with the myriad sufferings of the world. So when misfortune befalls someone, everyone is caught off guard.

Proceed with caution.

Slowly.

The old Daoist master of the Observation Temple, observing the myriad lives within the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, clearly had mastery over the time river of that blessed place, able to speed up, slow down, or even come to a standstill.

But as for the time currents of the four corners of the world, to say one could control them was a stretch; even the Dao Ancestor could not claim such power. Hence, the Sage of the Ancients once reflected upon water and gained insight: the passage of time is relentless, indifferent to day and night.

Cui Dongshan once remarked that all the mountains, immortal abodes, and human cities in the world held profound mysteries. The interplay of war and the teachings of the various schools involved the speed of the time river’s flow. The sages sought an alternative method to request a slower pace.

Why, despite standing so high and seeing so far, did these three sages insist on slowing down? What, in the eyes of the Sage of Sages, the Buddha, and the Dao Ancestor, was so crucial that they would urge the people of the world to “proceed with caution”?

During his first journey through Huangting Kingdom with Cui Dongshan, on a mountaintop, Cui had jokingly remarked that as the wheels of history advance, they inevitably crush many flowers and grasses.

This wasn’t merely the cruel words of a ruler, but the lament of a refined scholar from the Central Lands, hoping that those in power would pause and glance at the trampled flowers and grasses.

As for whether the world is slowly improving, is there any need to worry? As long as it is improving and the direction is right, it doesn’t matter how slow it is, and certainly, there’s no need for concern.

But if the world is deteriorating, as the wheels of history roll forward with great momentum, crushing countless flowers and grasses in its path, even if someone wishes to look down, they may not see clearly.

What then can be done about it?

Is that why we should take it slow?

Because if we proceed slowly, even if we veer onto a wrong path, moving slowly and errantly might just mean there’s a chance to correct it. Or perhaps, it could mean that human suffering could be lessened?

Chen Ping’an walked back and forth along the railing, reaching the end before turning around, repeating this motion again and again.

At that moment, he was unaware that deep within his heart, every profound thought was like seeds in his mind, ready to sprout. Many might wither along the way, but some would bloom and bear fruit one day.

He also had no idea that the words he had painstakingly inscribed onto bamboo slips, words he chewed over and repeated, would lead Pei Qian to sunbathe those slips on a sunny day, believing them to be beautiful and meaningful.

Regardless of the quality of those words or the correctness of the reasoning, they were all seeds sown in his heart.

Chen Ping’an was not an exception; in fact, people were like this too. They might not carve bamboo slips to materialize their thoughts, but the complaints of parents, the teachings of teachers, the phrases in books revisited time and again, the old sayings and lessons that suddenly make sense one day, the mountains and waters seen, the beloved girls missed, and the friends lost are all seeds in everyone’s hearts, waiting to bloom.

For now, Chen Ping’an merely considered it a casual stroll along the railing.

Within the small world of human existence, the green-clad children in the water palace paused their busy tasks, holding their breath in concentration.

Meanwhile, in the golden-walled residence, a sleeping dragon of true energy coiled outside. Inside, a small figure in golden robes, sword slung over his back, with several golden books at his waist, shimmered with ever-brighter golden light, like a deity cast in gold.

Yet this little figure, glowing with golden light, continuously radiated glimmers of gold, clearly unstable.

It was filled with anticipation, eagerly awaiting the moment Chen Ping’an would pause on the railing.

Chen Ping’an continued to walk slowly.

On this journey away from the Cliffside Academy, he had posed a question to Zhu Lian and Shi Rou.

If killing one innocent person could save ten lives, would you do it? Both shook their heads. When Chen Ping’an escalated the numbers to saving a thousand or even ten thousand, Shi Rou began to waver.

Only Zhu Lian candidly stated that even if he could save the entire world, he would not kill that person.

Chen Ping’an then asked why.

Zhu Lian smiled as he replied, “I’m afraid I might be that person who gets killed.”

Zhu Lian turned back to ask Chen Ping’an for his answer.

Chen Ping’an admitted he couldn’t provide one either, unless he truly faced that situation, then he might understand his own heart and choices.

In the golden palace, the small figure in golden robes grew anxious, several times wanting to burst out of the palace doors, to rush out of the small world of human existence and reward that Chen Ping’an with a few big chestnuts. Why dwell on these grand dilemmas that are bound to lead nowhere? Don’t lose focus; don’t let this rare opportunity slip by! The direction you were thinking earlier is correct! Quickly think of that vital word “slow,” the one so easily overlooked by the mundane world, and consider it more deeply and thoroughly! Once you understand it, your soul will resonate, and this will be your opportunity to ascend to the Fifth Realm!

Yet if this inner truth were revealed to Chen Ping’an, it would only plunge him into a terrible state of mind.

Finally, Chen Ping’an stopped at the railing.

The small figures in golden robes and the green-clad children were all filled with anticipation.

Then the green-clad children exchanged glances and suddenly burst into laughter.

It turned out that after Chen Ping’an came to a stop, in that moment of pure thought, he began to miss a certain girl. Not only that, but his thoughts were particularly unchaste—he was considering that next time he met her at the Sword Qi Great Wall, it couldn’t just be a simple hand-holding; he needed to be bolder. If Ning girl was unwilling, he could just scold her a few times, believing they would still end up together. But what if, by chance, Ning girl actually wanted him to take the initiative? He was a man, after all; how could he hesitate? 

Chen Ping’an jumped down from the railing, feeling drowsy. As he walked back to the house, he pumped his fists, cheering himself on, “That’s not right, definitely not right! Besides, over at Upside Down Mountain, you’ve embraced Ning girl before! You were just too dazed then to remember what it felt like; that won’t do! A kiss… Chen Ping’an, are you trying to get yourself killed? You can’t think about that; it’s too soon! Didn’t you just think about taking it slow? You should be more cautious with Ning girl. Slow cooking is also good… what the hell is ‘good’?”

The green-clad children rolled on the ground, holding their bellies with laughter.

It wasn’t that they comprehended all of Chen Ping’an’s thoughts, but tonight was an exception, for what he was thinking was deeply intertwined with his mental state, reaching into the very essence of his being. His thoughts were grand, stirring his soul, almost enveloping the entire small world of human existence.

The small figure in golden robes, enveloped in rich golden light, nearly coalescing into a golden core within his heart, leaned back and couldn’t help but curse, “Damn you, Chen Ping’an!”

After cursing, he couldn’t help but smile.

Though tonight’s “blooming and bearing fruit” wasn’t perfect and far from flawless, it was indeed greatly beneficial to both Chen Ping’an and himself.

For instance, the nascent golden core in the heart of the little figure in golden robes was precisely what Mao Xiaodong had hoped for when he helped Chen Ping’an refine the golden literary spirit of Shen Wen.

 ### Chapter 431: The Perils of the Jianghu

Lady Xiao Luan and her maidservant lived alone in a secluded courtyard within the remote areas of the Ziyang Estate. 

If she had been arranged to stay with Sun Deng and his companions, even with Lady Xiao Luan's temperament, it would have ended in a confrontation.

At this moment, Lady Xiao Luan stood in the main hall, while someone else sat leisurely. The maid had already been put into a deep sleep by that person using secret techniques.

That person cast a sidelong glance at the overly tight-fitting gown of the River God, Bai Hu Jiang, a strange smile playing on his lips.

Lady Xiao Luan's face was a mix of embarrassment and discomfort.

This person was none other than Wu Yi, who claimed the title of the True Monarch of Cave Spirit, the true master of Ziyang Estate.

No matter how bold Lady Xiao Luan was, she certainly wouldn’t dare to enter the forbidden area of the Ziqi Palace uninvited, nor would she dare to knock on Chen Ping'an's door dressed in such a gown that could rival that of a brothel courtesan. All of this was at Wu Yi's insistence.

Wu Yi did not use his cultivation to intimidate her but offered Lady Xiao Luan a condition she could not refuse.

The issue at hand involved the River God of Yu Jiang trying to use connections within Longquan County to harm the Bai Hu Jiang Water God’s estate.

The estate master, Huang Chu, had already promised Lady Xiao Luan that he would help persuade the River God of Yu Jiang to cease his underhanded actions.

For this, the Bai Hu Jiang Water God’s estate would henceforth need to pay a substantial tribute to Ziyang Estate every ten years. From that moment on, Bai Hu Jiang would become a vassal of Ziyang Estate, similar to Tie Quan He, but it was not just a matter of losing money to avert disaster. This arrangement would alleviate their immediate crisis, and after allying with Ziyang Estate, although it meant drifting further away from the current Hong dynasty, Huang Chu assured Lady Xiao Luan that he would extend the length of Bai Hu Jiang from less than nine hundred li to twelve hundred li within a century! The costs would be borne by the Water God’s estate, but Ziyang Estate could assist in dealing with any bureaucratic obstacles from the Huang Ting Kingdom, as well as the fierce resistance from the mountain gods whose fates were being usurped. The Bai Hu Jiang Water God’s estate would merely need to hire cultivators from Ziyang Estate at market prices to suppress and eliminate any opposition.

While the divine tribute money was easy to procure, the length of Bai Hu Jiang would determine the size and capacity of its waterways. It required not just the court's approval for the excavation, but it would inevitably face various powerful resistances. It wasn't merely a matter of having money; after Bai Hu Jiang stretched to twelve hundred li, the increase in the jurisdiction of the water area would bring in all surrounding counties, towns, and scenic spots under the Bai Hu Jiang Water God’s estate's control. The annual profits would become extremely significant, a dream that Lady Xiao Luan had long yearned for. In a hundred years, not only would they surpass the River God of Yu Jiang and become the second-largest river in the Huang Ting Kingdom, but it was also conceivable that one day they could ascend to the status of a Water God's Palace.

This was the true reason why Lady Xiao Luan was so humble and submissive in Xue Mang Hall.

She had to seize this promising future tightly!

This was no longer about enduring temporary humiliation for peace, but rather about enduring now to walk the path of greatness and prosperity.

Thus, when Wu Yi approached Lady Xiao Luan with a second deal, filled with visions for the future, she weighed the pros and cons, and despite her grievances, anger, and shame, she chose to suppress her feelings and nodded in agreement.

Wu Yi said that if Lady Xiao Luan was willing to climb onto Chen Ping'an's bed tonight, and they shared that moment of passion, it would be equivalent to helping Wu Yi and Ziyang Estate. In return, Wu Yi would ensure that Tie Quan He became a true vassal of Bai Hu Jiang, and the incense temple could no longer intimidate with its status, resisting the might of a grand water estate. Furthermore, from now on, Wu Yi would speak favorably on behalf of Lady Xiao Luan and the Bai Hu Jiang Water God’s estate in the Dali Dynasty. As for whether this would ultimately lead to a peace treaty, Wu Yi could not guarantee it, but she would at least personally facilitate the matter.

And thus, Lady Xiao Luan's enchanting night visit was set in motion.

Even the light rain that fell was an illusion created by Wu Yi's magical abilities, meant to convince Chen Ping'an that Lady Xiao Luan was indeed a River God, filled with springtime affection, willingly offering herself for a fleeting encounter with no strings attached. What could be better? Moreover, there was a deeper scheme; previously, Wu Yi had mentioned the karmic burden of slaying the dragon-like creature, which was no empty talk. In fact, she could see that there was indeed a karmic tie on Chen Ping'an that needed resolving. The solution? To use the merit of the Bai Hu Jiang Water God to help dispel it. Wu Yi straightforwardly stated that she would compensate Lady Xiao Luan with divine tribute money for this loss, and after consideration, she agreed.

Unfortunately, Lady Xiao Luan returned empty-handed.

Chen Ping'an hadn’t even let her through the door.

Wu Yi slowly spoke, “Xiao Luan, such a great opportunity, and you couldn’t seize it. You really are useless.”

Lady Xiao Luan forced a smile, her expression bitter.

Wu Yi suddenly asked, “Could it be that Chen Ping'an isn’t interested in women like you? Your maid looks young, and her looks are decent; perhaps she could give it a try?”

Lady Xiao Luan shook her head, “She probably wouldn’t even get past the building where Yuan Jun resides. That fellow named Zhu Lian is a martial artist from the Far Journey realm, and he has been pestering me for a long time. He seems frivolous, but at the final moment, he has shown a murderous intent toward me. Zhu Lian deliberately does not hide this, so if she goes instead, she might be killed right outside the building, with her body either discarded in Ziqi Palace or simply tossed into Tie Quan He, floating downstream until it reaches our Bai Hu Jiang.”

Wu Yi rubbed her forehead, “What is Chen Ping'an thinking?”

Lady Xiao Luan sighed helplessly. When that man shut the door without a word, she was just as furious and embarrassed.

Wu Yi scrutinized Lady Xiao Luan, “Xiao Luan, your beauty is already considered top-notch in our Huang Ting Kingdom, right? Where can I find another woman with such a good figure for him? The worldly women down the mountain may seem fine at first glance, but they all smell foul. Xiao Luan, do you think it’s possible that a woman of your ample stature isn’t to Chen Ping’an’s taste? Does he only like petite and delicate girls, or perhaps exceptionally tall ones?”

Lady Xiao Luan shook her head.

She truly didn’t know.

Wu Yi sighed, “Then tell me, is Chen Ping'an a normal man?”

Lady Xiao Luan replied softly, “He should be.”

Wu Yi looked serious, “What do you think of me?”

Lady Xiao Luan felt a chill run down her spine. From Chen Ping'an to Zhu Lian, and now to this ancestor of Ziyang Estate before her, they were all incomprehensible madmen.

She had to carefully choose her words, saying something flattering, “Yuan Jun is of such noble status; how could you demean yourself like this?”

Wu Yi waved her hand, feeling disheartened, “Forget it. It doesn’t make sense to force you, Xiao Luan, to barge into the loft and have Chen Ping'an take you by force.”

Wu Yi stood up, “However, this deal, even if it doesn’t work tonight, will still be valid for a while. You still have a chance, Xiao Luan. Just see how you handle it.”

Suddenly, both Wu Yi and Lady Xiao Luan sensed an unusual aura of… the Great Dao.

It was high, ethereal, majestic, and vast, indescribable and miraculous.

Both of them had caught a hint of something.

Wu Yi said sternly, “Xiao Luan! What now?”

Lady Xiao Luan’s heart stirred, and without a moment’s hesitation, her fighting spirit ignited. The answer in the heart of the Bai Hu Jiang Water God was now unwavering.

Compared to that chance encounter with the ancestor of the Hong family by Bai Hu Jiang years ago, Lady Xiao Luan's thoughts were now even more fervent.

Wu Yi strode away, and Lady Xiao Luan returned to her room, tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep.

That night, Ziyang Estate saw another rain fall.

Zhu Lian stood in the corridor beneath the eaves on the second floor, grinning as he said, “Well, it’s getting serious now.”

---

Chen Ping'an was unaware of any of this.

He returned to his room, where the lamp on the table still flickered.

Chen Ping'an resumed reading, but after a while, he looked up, glancing around.

The book mentioned that some people’s hearts were like mirrors that revealed the ghosts and monsters lurking around, rendering them unable to hide.

Yet Chen Ping'an hoped his true heart was merely a lamp, placed on the table in his empty ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley, allowing him to see the dust and moths accompanying him. If guests visited, they would see the rough little pottery basin he had placed on the yellow clay windowsill, where a small, swaying green plant grew.

Chen Ping'an leaned over the table.

His chin rested on the back of his hand as he gazed at the flickering lamp.

He vaguely knew that something awaited him to confront.

Chen Ping'an considered many possible outcomes, feeling unafraid.

But there was one thing, one person.

That made him hesitant to think too much.

In this world, there was no distinction between close and distant relationships—this was what he himself had always said.

---

Pei Qian suddenly jolted awake, sitting up as if she had just experienced a nightmare.

She thought for a moment but had already forgotten the dream's content. Wiping the sweat from her forehead and still a bit dazed, she found a talisman, pressed it to her forehead, and promptly fell back asleep.

She could see into the hearts of others, perceiving the inner landscapes of their minds. For example, the bloody storms surrounding the old chef Zhu Lian, with only a tall building standing sturdy amidst chaos; or the deep, serene pool of Cui Dongshan, with golden books scattered along the bank.

She harbored a profound secret in her heart, one she had not even revealed to her master, Chen Ping'an.

Whenever she focused on Chen Ping'an, it felt like she was standing at the bottom of a small well, looking up at a lamp placed at the mouth of the well—a small light that should comfort and beckon her, a timid girl afraid of ghosts and darkness. Yet it would make her gaze up at the scorching sun in the sky, causing her eyes to burn and tears to flow. Each time, she would heal her wounds only to forget the pain, unable to resist looking up again.

When she looked down, she saw the gentle ripples of the moon's reflection on the water's surface, beneath which a shadowy figure, resembling a dragon that should be terrifying, instead drew her heart closer.

The well in her master’s heart was filling with water.

Perhaps one day, the moon in the water would meet that lamp at the well’s mouth.

In her deep sleep, Pei Qian instinctively placed her hand on her heart, where she had secretly kept a small pouch taught to her by Cui Dongshan, meant for the day her master was heartbroken and angry, to be handed over to him.

---

Chen Ping'an had not slept a wink all night.

On a whim, he decided not to linger any longer at Ziyang Estate. He instructed Zhu Lian and the steward to inform Wu Yi of his departure.

Unexpectedly, the estate master Huang Chu rushed over, desperately trying to convince Chen Ping'an to stay. He stated that if Chen Ping'an left Ziyang Estate like this, he would be forced to resign as estate master. Regardless of the circumstances, he implored Chen Ping'an to stay for another day or two, so he could show him the sights around Ziyang Estate. Additionally, he had news to share: the Yuan Jun ancestor had gone to the Cold Food River, but before leaving, she had announced that when Chen Ping'an and the others departed Ziyang Estate, they could each take one item from the treasure vault of Ziqi Palace, from the first to the fourth floor, as a parting gift from Ziyang Estate. If Chen Ping'an refused, then Huang Chu would choose four of the most precious items right in front of him and smash them on the spot.

Chen Ping'an increasingly found it hard to guess what Wu Yi was plotting.

This kind of shameless hospitality was utterly unreasonable; even Wei Ban would never have such a degree of favoritism.

Naturally, Chen Ping'an wished to leave this place of turmoil immediately, regardless of whether Huang Chu smashed four treasures or not, considering Wu Yi's unwarranted affections and Lady Xiao Luan’s late-night visit. Chen Ping'an had developed a psychological aversion to Ziyang Estate.

However, Huang Chu seemed to have anticipated this, discarding all pretenses and adopting a shameless demeanor, saying that whether he could remain the estate master depended solely on Chen Ping'an's decision. Was it too much to ask for a day or two of sightseeing to express Ziyang Estate's hospitality? Did Chen Ping'an really want to watch Huang Chu lose his position?

After discussing with Zhu Lian and Shi Rou, Chen Ping'an decided to go with the flow and agree to Huang Chu’s request to stay for one more day to see the nearby scenery.

As a result, when Ziyang Estate sent someone to guide them, Chen Ping'an regretted his decision, while Zhu Lian seemed to take pleasure in his misfortune, finding it quite amusing.

It turned out that the elegant and poised Lady Xiao Luan would be leading Chen Ping'an and the others on a tour of the scenic spots.

With a resolute heart, Chen Ping'an boarded a boat moored by Tie Quan He, heading upstream.

As night fell, the group returned to Ziyang Estate.

Wu Yi stood in the small courtyard of Lady Xiao Luan’s residence, smiling as she asked, “How did it go?”

Lady Xiao Luan hesitated, wanting to say something but holding back.

Wu Yi's expression soured, “Just speak plainly!”

Lady Xiao Luan sighed, “Throughout the journey, despite my numerous hints and being completely honest about my feelings, Chen Ping'an never gave me a pleasant expression or said a word. Just before disembarking, he spoke to me twice.”

Wu Yi was curious, “What did he say?”

Lady Xiao Luan forced a bitter smile, “The first thing he said was, ‘Lady Xiao Luan, are you trying to kill me on purpose?’”

Wu Yi was left baffled.

Lady Xiao Luan felt a sense of unease, “The second thing he said seriously was, ‘If you keep bothering me like this, I’ll punch you to death.’”

Wu Yi rubbed her temples with her fingers.

Lady Xiao Luan covered her mouth and giggled, a sudden surge of charm flowing through her, but she quickly composed herself, patting her chest softly, and said, “I know he wasn’t joking, so I really felt scared, but I can’t help feeling a bit indignant. However, I also realize that this time, I’m destined to miss a great opportunity.”

With utmost respect, Lady Xiao Luan bowed to Wu Yi in apology.

Wu Yi eyed Lady Xiao Luan sideways, “You do know your own worth.”

Lady Xiao Luan paused for a moment, suddenly realizing, and discreetly glanced at the tall and slightly slender Wu Yi, quickly averting her gaze, feeling a bit shy.

Wu Yi, annoyed, exclaimed, “That Chen Ping'an is just a blind fool!”

---

Zhu Lian had been secretly laughing, standing beside Chen Ping'an on the fourth-floor corridor.

Unable to contain his amusement any longer, Zhu Lian asked, “Young Master, how do you feel about encountering such a mindless romantic fortune?”

Chen Ping'an frowned, “The Jianghu is treacherous!”

**(End of Chapter)**

 ### Chapter 432: Departing on a Sword over the Sea of Clouds

At dawn, Chen Ping'an and his companions packed their belongings, preparing to leave Ziyang Prefecture.

The Prefect, Huang Chu, along with two elderly immortals from the Dragon Gate realm, personally escorted them to the banks of the Iron Ticket River. The river god of Jixiang Temple had already prepared a ferry boat, ready to travel downstream for over a hundred miles before disembarking at a dock to continue towards the border of the Huangting Kingdom.

Chen Ping'an expressed his gratitude to Huang Chu. In response, Huang Chu produced a small purple sandalwood box that emanated a refreshing wood fragrance, a gift from the "Ganyutai" literary offering of the Huangting Kingdom, said to be a token of kindness from the old ancestor.

Pei Qian maintained a stoic expression, pretending not to care at all.

After a moment of hesitation, Chen Ping'an accepted the small box containing four treasures from the Treasure Pavilion, saying, "If you ever pass through Longquan County in the future, please be sure to visit the Dusty Mountain."

He then lifted the precious box with a playful tone, "Without such a generous parting gift and without the old Jiao’s coveted wine from the Xuemang Hall, it would just be some home-cooked dishes. I reckon that even if Huang Prefect were to pass through Longquan County, you wouldn't be too keen to say hello to me."

Huang Chu smiled, "As long as there’s a chance to visit Dali, even if I don’t pass through Longquan County, I will find an opportunity to detour and disturb Young Master Chen."

In a pleasant conversation, Huang Chu accompanied Chen Ping'an and the others to the ferry. Initially intending to board and see them off to the dock, Chen Ping'an insisted they need not do so, and only then did Huang Chu relent.

Once on the boat, Chen Ping'an stood at the bow, the sword pouch at his waist filled with the spiritually-rich Jiao's coveted wine. The ferry slowly glided downstream, and Chen Ping'an cupped his fists towards the direction of the Ziqi Palace.

On the top floor of the Treasure Pavilion, a tall female cultivator performed an illusion spell. It was Wu Yi, the True Monarch of the Cave Spirit. Seeing this scene, she smiled, "It's easy to invite the gods, but sending them off isn’t difficult either."

Her mood was quite pleasant.

Wu Yi had already reported the details of the past couple of days to her father via a flying sword messenger to the Piyun Mountain in Longquan County. She believed that even if she didn’t receive accolades, at the very least, she wouldn’t be punished.

In her line of sight, the distant ferry began to shrink until it resembled nothing more than a mustard seed.

Suddenly, Wu Yi felt a tension in her heart and dared not move.

She was startled to find that at some point, a refined elder in a Confucian robe had appeared beside her. He had effortlessly breached the mountain and water formation of Ziyang Prefecture and silently arrived at Wu Yi’s side.

Steadying her nerves, Wu Yi softly said, “Unfilial daughter greets Father.”

The unexpected guest turned out to be the former Minister of the Ministry of Revenue of Huangting Kingdom, now the Vice Master of the Piyun Mountain Linlu Academy. Over his long life, this old Jiao had adopted countless aliases.

The elder glanced at Wu Yi and, for the first time, offered a smile, “You managed to achieve three benefits with one move; when did your mind become so sharp?”

Wu Yi felt anxious and uneasy, suspecting her father was being sarcastic or implying something deeper, and she was already contemplating fleeing to safety.

The elder rested his palm on the railing and slowly said, “What capabilities does the River God of the Jiang have to wreak havoc on Baihu River's Xiao Luan? His grand journey to Dragon Spring County was merely a drinking binge with that little snake. This blue-clad boy from Dusty Mountain, trying to impress his friends by asking for a peace talisman, was already hitting walls and struggling. In truth, it was Xiao Luan herself who got flustered and, in a desperate bid, lowered herself to seek refuge in your Ziyang Prefecture. However, Xiao Luan wouldn't willingly give up the incense ties with the Hong Clan; she’s quite clever. By serving Ziyang Prefecture, she stands to gain much, and you too can profit while lying down—mutually beneficial, that’s one.”

The elder opened his palm, looked down, and shook his head, then continued with his hands behind his back, “Your attempts to curry favor with Chen Ping'an were rather clumsy and too rigid, especially at the Xuemang Hall banquet, where you even tried to press Chen Ping'an. Yet, just like a misstep in Go, it surprisingly worked in your favor, improving Chen Ping'an’s impression of you. If you had continued to present yourself as overly scheming, Chen Ping'an would only have grown more cautious and wary of you and Ziyang Prefecture. In the end, you would accumulate no goodwill. The most brilliant part was your attempt to create the illusion of the River God developing feelings during the night rain, which inadvertently granted Chen Ping'an a tremendous opportunity. If I hadn’t suppressed it intentionally, the heavenly phenomena would have been much greater. Not only Ziyang Prefecture but the entire Iron Ticket River, and even the spirits of Baihu River, would have sensed it, sharing in the rain and dew. The sage loves the mountains but is even closer to water, which holds great wisdom. So what you did was a delightful surprise for your father, a significant one. That’s two.”

The elder turned and chuckled, “Lastly, your invitation for Chen Ping'an to visit Ziyang Prefecture was arranged by the National Master. National Master Cui explicitly told me that it was merely to slow Chen Ping'an's journey home. As for what the National Master seeks, he certainly wouldn’t disclose it to an outsider like me, and honestly, I don’t want to know. Getting involved in this, win or lose, we’re both fated to reap no rewards. By helping your father accomplish this task, you essentially lent a small hand to National Master Cui, and Ziyang Prefecture will undoubtedly be rewarded by Dali in the future. Just wait for the good news.”

It was indeed great news, but Wu Yi couldn’t help but feel a chill throughout her body. She never thought her father had been observing the farce from start to finish.

At that moment, Wu Yi, standing in the corridor of the tall building facing the old Jiao, felt much like Xiao Luan's wife facing Wu Yi in the small courtyard, sharing the same mindset.

The old Jiao, dressed and looking like a worldly scholar, opened his palm once more, frowning, “What else can we glean from this?”

Wu Yi quietly looked over.

She watched as her father used his divine abilities to condense the essence of the water mist from the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, his palm filled with droplets that seemed freshly plucked from rain-soaked lotus leaves. Then, those droplets simultaneously burst in his palm, turning into a puddle of rainwater. After gazing at it for a long while, her father remained puzzled, and the water transformed back into individual droplets. In Wu Yi’s eyes, her father, who excelled in the scholarly arts, was slightly hesitant. He extended his other palm to catch the original droplets, and in an instant, Wu Yi saw a flash of golden light in her father’s palm. Before she could focus on it, he swiftly clenched his fist, and she could no longer see what was in her father’s palm.

The elder pondered for a moment, then smiled at Wu Yi, “There’s nothing worth viewing.”

Wu Yi naturally did not dare to pry further.

The elder asked, “Do you know why beings with spirits in this world tirelessly pursue human forms? Clearly, the human body is so frail that even eating grains to survive becomes a hindrance to cultivation. That’s why Qi practitioners emphasize fasting to avoid polluting the divine and depleting their innate vitality, which would prevent them from rejuvenating into infancy. In contrast, our kind, the Jiao dragons, are naturally endowed; not only do we possess robust physiques, but our intelligence is also not inferior to that of humans. So why do we stand here in human form?”

Wu Yi was left puzzled, hesitant to speak, because the concept of human apertures and realms was already a consensus among the mountain cultivators and all spirits and demons. Her father would certainly not be spouting nonsense, so where lay the mystery?

The elder did not press Wu Yi, one of the few remaining children in this world, “The marvel lies in a single word: ‘return.’”

He extended a finger and traced a circle in the air.

Wu Yi fell into deep thought.

The elder smiled, “You’re still young and inexperienced. Don’t even mention the scenes from three thousand years ago; even a thousand years ago, if I didn’t tell you, where would you find the answers?”

Wu Yi’s expression grew solemn, realizing her father was imparting her a chance to comprehend the path to enlightenment!

She had been stuck at the Golden Core stage for over three hundred years, and that sideline cultivation method, which could elevate practitioners to the Nascent Soul stage, had proven to be a challenging endeavor for her as a descendant of the Jiao dragons. Instead of making progress, she had faced many setbacks. After much perseverance, she had finally reached the peak of the Golden Core stage, but for over a hundred years, she had encountered a bottleneck, leaving her in despair.

The elder gazed up at the sky, “Aren’t you curious about where the teachings of the three schools and the various philosophers originate? What brings them here? And how do they ultimately become the masters of the world? Hmm, as for the last point, there are many chaotic tales from the mountains and wilds, some far from the truth, and some closer. You might have a general understanding of some insider secrets.”

Wu Yi nodded.

Three thousand years ago, the last true dragon escaped from the Central Divine Continent, relying on its innate divine abilities governing the world’s waterways, choosing to land at the Old Dragon City on the southernmost tip of Baoping Continent. During this journey, it was severely injured, crashing into the earth and forcibly creating a dragon path, only to be suppressed by an unknown great cultivator using a now-lost method. Ultimately, the dying true dragon fell near what would become the Li Pearl Cave, and thus it perished. A great cultivator later used secret techniques to forge that very Li Pearl Cave, hanging like a pearl above the Dali Dynasty.

The elder sighed, “Your understanding truly leaves much to be desired.”

Wu Yi felt somewhat wronged.

The elder waved his sleeve, temporarily transforming Ziyang Prefecture into a small realm. He then took out a small celestial boat, one that had once sailed towards the celestial rivers, and stepped into the wooden vessel, gesturing for Wu Yi to follow before asking, “What do you think is the most powerful existence to have appeared in this world?”

Wu Yi timidly replied, “The founders of the three teachings? And those fourteen transcendents who refuse to enter the world? The former becomes akin to heaven itself as long as they are in their realms, while the latter has transcended the bounds of realms and possesses all sorts of incredible divine abilities…”

The elder neither confirmed nor denied this, casually pointing to a direction along the Iron Ticket River, smiling, “The Jixiang Temple, further out, the Baihu River’s River God’s Manor, and even farther, your brother’s Cold Food River estate, along with the surrounding mountain and river spirits’ temples. What do they have in common? Never mind, I’ll just say it directly. Given your limited intellect, waiting for you to provide an answer would be a waste of my spiritual energy. The commonality is that all those mountain and river deities in the eyes of the people, as long as they have a temple, can be sculpted into golden bodies. Regardless of your previous cultivation aptitude, they all become deities with golden bodies. This can be said to be an instant ascent to the heavens. Do they need to cultivate afterward? It’s merely a matter of receiving incense offerings. The more they receive, the higher their realm, and the slower their golden bodies decay. This is an entirely different path from that of Qi practitioners. Thus, we say that immortals are distinct from one another. Now, back to that word ‘return,’ do you understand?”

Wu Yi shook her head, “Still not quite.”
