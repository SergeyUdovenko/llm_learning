 # Chapter 631: Gu Can is Still That Gu Can

This year, Yunlou City (Yunlou Cheng) in Shujian Lake (Shujian Hu) hosted the Water-Land Grand Gathering and the Zhou Tian Grand Sacrifice, spending countless amounts of money. They invited many divine beings from both Buddhist and Daoist sects, and not the kind that merely sought fame.

This was largely due to the unique status of the two organizers—Jiejiang Zhenjun Liu Zhimiao, who transitioned from a prisoner of Gongliu Island to a revered figure of the Zhenjing Sect, and General Guan Yiran, stationed at Shujian Lake. Otherwise, the costs would have at least doubled. Convincing these mountain cultivators to descend required considerable offerings. Of course, it was a fortunate event as well, allowing the participating divine beings to accumulate merits while also getting acquainted with Liu Zhimiao and Guan Yiran, which motivated the Daoist gods and high-ranking monks to take these rituals seriously.

Among them, three figures remained inconspicuous in the background. However, the military officials accompanying General Guan held a certain admiration for their accounting skills.

Those three were named Gu Can, Zeng Ye, and Ma Duyi.

The two grand events successfully concluded, and everyone praised the merits of Liu Zhimiao and General Guan. 

That night, after drinking a victory toast with the officials under General Guan, a tall and slender youth dressed in a green robe walked alone back to his residence, a quiet alley in the city of Chishui (Chishui Cheng). He rented a small house there, and waiting at the door was a tall young man, anxiously looking out. This tall youth was Zeng Ye, a fortunate one rescued from the fire pit by the old cultivator Zhang Ye of Qingxia Island, who subsequently worked at the sect's gate. During that time, he assisted an accountant and traveled across various countries, improving his cultivation through unconventional methods.

Ma Duyi was also awake. Being a ghost herself, she trained better at night. Currently, she had lit a lamp on the table and was calculating expenses for the two grand events, which had cost a fortune. Fortunately, an old hunchbacked man named Zhu Lian had sent two large sums of money, one delivered personally by Zhu Lian himself, who was amiable and talkative, and the second entrusted to a young man named Dong Shuijing, who brought it to them in Yunlou City.

Ma Duyi was dressed in the fox fur of the Xu family from Qingfeng City, her beauty captivating.

Gu Can stood outside, patting his clothes to dissipate some of the alcohol smell. He lightly knocked on the door, entered, poured himself a cup of tea, and sat opposite Ma Duyi, while Zeng Ye took a seat on the stool between them.

Ma Duyi did not lift her head, “The officials from the General’s mansion are far less greedy than those county officials we dealt with back in the day. Aside from some minor expenses, there’s hardly any corruption.”

Gu Can replied nonchalantly, “Not greedy? First, they lack the guts to act carelessly under General Guan’s watch. Second, they have a bright future ahead and wouldn’t want to jeopardize their careers over money. It’s not wise to sacrifice their prospects for a little silver. Those who can’t see that clearly won’t last long as General Guan’s aides. However, there are indeed some civil officials who, while not after wealth, will act accordingly in the future.”

Ma Duyi stretched lazily, and Gu Can had already handed her a cup of tea.

Over time, having spent day in and day out together, even Ma Duyi no longer felt the slightest awkwardness. As for Zeng Ye, he had long taken the cup of tea Gu Can handed over.

Gu Can smiled, “Everyone’s worked hard.”

Ma Duyi finished her tea in one gulp, rubbing her wrist with enthusiasm, “Finally, we have some leisure time to explore! I plan to visit all the surrounding countries near Shujian Lake! Shihai Kingdom, Meiyou Kingdom, I want to go to all of them!”

Gu Can reminded her, “I’ll give you the Taiping Wushi talisman later. When visiting these vassal states of the Great Li, try to stick close to the main cities where the Great Li garrisons are stationed. If trouble arises, you can seek help. But during normal times, it’s best not to reveal the talisman to avoid attracting hostility from those who’ve lost their kingdoms.”

Ma Duyi rolled her eyes, “You’re being too fussy! Do I need you to teach me these basic things? I’ve been on the road with Mr. Chen long before you!”

Gu Can shrugged, smiling, “Then I’ll head off to rest. Socializing in taverns is exhausting.”

Exiting the small room, Gu Can went to the study on the side of the main house. On the desk lay the ghostly artifact “Underworld” Yama Hall, acquired from the accountant back in the day, along with a replica of the Liuli Pavilion sold by the venerable Yuhai of Qingxia Island to the accountant. Compared to the Underworld, this Liuli Pavilion only had twelve rooms, with eleven filled with resentful spirits, all former cultivators at the fifth realm, now turned into vengeful ghosts, filled with deep attachments. Years had passed, and around half of the rooms were still occupied.

Gu Can sat in a chair, gazing at the Underworld Yama Hall, lost in thought. His mind was as small as a mustard seed, yet as vast as Qingxia Island compared to all of Shujian Lake. Gu Can’s spirit was immersed in it, willing to assist the souls and resentful spirits seeking to leave through the Water-Land Ritual and the Zhou Tian Grand Sacrifice—over two hundred of them. Most were spirits who had achieved their wishes and no longer clung to this life, hoping for rebirth to live differently.

Yet some spirits chose to remain in the Underworld, day after day, year after year, cursing and berating him, the main perpetrator. Many of them also included that accountant in their vile curses.

Despite all this, Gu Can still adhered to his agreement with them, not only refraining from destroying any spirit but also needing to periodically offer them celestial coins to retain some spiritual light, preventing them from becoming vengeful ghosts.

Withdrawing from the Underworld, Gu Can shifted his focus to the Liuli Pavilion, walking through each dark room where nothing was visible. Only when a ferocious spirit stood at the door could Gu Can make eye contact with them.

At that moment, a ghostly figure in snow-white clothing stood stiffly at the doorway. Despite being only a foot apart, she showed no intent to attack.

Before Gu Can took over the Liuli Pavilion, these spirits had made a pact with the accountant, agreeing that if he entered the Liuli Pavilion to seek revenge, he could do so without consequence, but the opportunity was limited to one time.

Back then, none of the eleven spirits chose to attack, but now, two had each made their own requests and decided to leave the mortal realm entirely. One requested that Gu Can promise to care for his family for at least a hundred years, ensuring they would be wealthy and free of calamity. Gu Can agreed. The other requested that Gu Can gift her a direct disciple and a magical artifact, ensuring that the disciple reached the fifth realm and that Gu Can would not interfere with their cultivation, nor harbor any malicious intent. Gu Can also agreed, saying that the artifact must be promised but that he could secretly assist her disciple on their path.

Three others chose to serve Gu Can as ghost generals, essentially becoming lowly deities in Gu Can’s future mountain sect, with their future financial paths and promotions based on their contributions. One of them was the old ghost who had left the Liuli Pavilion early to help Ma Duyi scout for opportunities, and he no longer visited the Liuli Pavilion for cultivation, instead managing the finances for the three of them.

Gu Can withdrew from the Liuli Pavilion, closing his eyes to rest, in a state akin to sleep.

Meanwhile, in the small room, Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye remained seated at the same table.

Ma Duyi was still daydreaming about future travels and considering her current possessions and little savings.

Zeng Ye hesitated, not wanting to leave. 

Ma Duyi asked, “What’s the matter?”

Zeng Ye replied, “What do you plan to do next?”

Ma Duyi frowned, “Isn’t it nice here? This Shujian Lake isn’t what it used to be, a place where life and death were beyond control. Now it has changed, look at how many wild cultivators have become disciples of the Zhenjing Sect. Of course, they’re all high-ranking, mostly from major island families. You, Zeng Ye, a nobody, can’t compare. But if you’re willing to ask Gu Can to help you clear a path, maybe in a few days you could become a ghost cultivator under the Zhenjing Sect. Even if you don’t want to join the Zhenjing Sect, you could just focus on your cultivation. After all, we have a good relationship with the General’s mansion. So Zeng Ye, you’re quite secure in Shujian Lake.”

Zeng Ye lowered his head, “I’m really afraid of Gu Can.”

Ma Duyi laughed, scolding him, “Look at your lack of ambition!”

After Zeng Ye left, Ma Duyi fell into contemplation.

Gu Can was increasingly resembling that accountant, but Ma Duyi was well aware that it was merely a resemblance.

Therefore, in truth, Ma Duyi also feared Gu Can.

At the General’s mansion within the Fan family in Chishui City, General Guan Yiran was still in his study working on official matters when the knock on the door sounded. He closed a confidential document and said, “Come in.”

A military cultivator named Yu Shanfang boldly crossed the threshold, took a chair, slumped back, and burped, “That drink was refreshing! That little brat named Gu, though young, really knows how to drink. He can hold his liquor! Damn it, I ended up in a drink-off with him and two brothers, and we agreed he’d be the one crawling under the table, but before we knew it, the three of us started fighting among ourselves. With nearly twenty people at two tables, only that brat and I managed to stand and leave. That kid even carried a few back to his place.”

Guan Yiran asked, “What do you think of that youth?”

Yu Shanfang replied, “I’ve heard so many rumors about Qingxia Island and that kid, but after a year of interaction, it’s not what I expected!”

Guan Yiran nodded, not saying much more.

Yu Shanfang couldn’t be bothered to think too deeply. His rugged soldier life didn’t allow for many complexities, and with Guan Yiran, a comrade who had been through life and death together for many years, he had little to fear.

Guan Yiran asked, “Yu Shanfang, I plan to get closer to that young man Dong Shuijing from Longquan County. I’m preparing to help him connect with my family to expand some small businesses.”

Yu Shanfang, feeling frustrated, said, “Why tell me this? I can’t be the accountant, nor can I be a guard dog. Let me make it clear, don’t ask me to be Dong Shuijing’s attendant. I’m a proper military cultivator of the Great Li. That clunky talisman armor belongs to my wife. If you dare to make me take it off for some petty fortune, I’ll kick you to death out of spite!”

Guan Yiran maintained a calm expression, “The financial routes below, the grain transport has always been a source of wealth. In the mountains, it’s akin to the celestial ferry service. All secular dynasties with grain transport have officials with considerable authority and reputation. Our Great Li court is about to establish a new office to oversee a ferry route and many docks, and the head will be just one rank below the Minister of Revenue. The court has already begun to fight for positions, and my Guan family has secured three. I can take the lowest position, which is rightfully mine, and no one in the family can object.”

At this point, Guan Yiran asked, “Yu Shanfang, I don’t want you to retire from the battlefield. That would frustrate you to death. I know you too well. I just want to use this opportunity to send you to that new office, so you can be in the open while Dong Shuijing operates in the shadows, helping each other out. You rise in rank and he makes money. Don’t worry; it’s all clean. Just consider it a favor for me.”

Yu Shanfang grumbled, “I’m not interested in any official position, so forget it. Give that opportunity to someone else.”

Guan Yiran asked, “Do you really want to die on the battlefield?”

Yu Shanfang grinned, “There are no death-defying battles now!”

Guan Yiran hesitated a moment, then said cautiously, “The upcoming battlefield is just as dangerous; it’s just not on horseback anymore. I’ll only tell you one thing, which isn’t classified. It’s something I’ve figured out: all military cultivators stationed outside of Great Li are at risk, including me. We could drop dead at any moment for no reason. Especially those near vassal states facing annihilation, the closer you are to the old capital or the fallen celestial peaks, the higher the likelihood of death for military cultivators. I can firmly say that treacherous assassinations will be frequent. Very, very frequent.”

Yu Shanfang replied, “Well, I guess that settles it. Not taking on an official role is the right choice. With your mediocre skills, without me around, wouldn’t you worry about getting stabbed in the back even when going to the toilet?”

Guan Yiran, annoyed, grabbed a bronze paperweight and threw it at him.

Yu Shanfang caught it with a smile, “Thank you for the generous gift, General!”

He leaped up, dashing to the door.

Guan Yiran sat there, irritated, “It’s just a worthless piece worth a couple of taels of silver, and you have the nerve to take it?”

Yu Shanfang stopped, turning back with a disdainful expression, throwing back the bronze paperweight, “You, a Guan family scion from Yizhou, display this shabby object on your table? I almost feel embarrassed for the old master Guan!”

Unexpectedly, Guan Yiran quickly extended his hands to catch it, gently exhaled, and carefully placed it back on the table, grinning, “This is a gift from the Emperor of the Zhu Ying Dynasty’s imperial study, personally given to me by General Su. It’s actually quite valuable.”

As Yu Shanfang opened the door, he turned his back to the future head of the Guan family, raised his arm high, and gave a middle finger before slamming the door behind him.

Guan Yiran shook his head with a smile. When his gaze fell back on the table, his smile faded.

He continued to peruse a lengthy secret report from the Green Wave Pavilion of the Great Li, which was quite rare in the Great Li court. Under the implementation of National Master Cui Zhan, all documents aimed for brevity.

The reason Guan Yiran was able to read this secret report wasn’t because he bore the Guan surname but because he happened to be the military general stationed in Shujian Lake, needing to provide his personal feedback.

This report came from a minor official in the Liu family of Qingluan Kingdom and had significant implications. Just glancing at a few lines made Guan Yiran feel a chill.

It detailed the future strategies concerning Shujian Lake.

Among them was mention of Gu Can, as well as Guan Yiran himself.

An old man quietly descended into the courtyard of the rented house.

Gu Can stored away the Underworld Yama Hall and the replica of the Liuli Pavilion into a bamboo box by his feet. He picked up a bamboo fan crafted from Shenxiao bamboo, tucked it into his waist, and smiled as he opened the main door.

The uninvited guest was none other than his legitimate master.

Rumored to have turned misfortune into fortune while in the water prison, Liu Zhimiao of Qingxia Island now had hopes of breaking through his bottleneck to the Nascent Soul stage.

After Gu Can opened the door, he performed a bow, “Disciple Gu Can pays respects to Master.”

Liu Zhimiao smiled and nodded, “There’s no need for such formality between us.”

The two sat in the main hall, beneath a plaque left by the previous occupants that read, “Eternal Renown.”

The couplets hanging on both sides were also quite old and hadn't been replaced, radiating an antique charm. “Upon opening the door, the mountains and rivers are clear to the eye. When closing the window, moral texts refine the heart.”

Liu Zhimiao surveyed the room, “The place is a bit small, but it’s peaceful.”

Gu Can asked, “Would Master like some wine? There’s no celestial brew here, but I have plenty of a friend’s sweet rice wine. However, you may not be accustomed to such common drinks.”

Liu Zhimiao waved his hand, smiling, “Let’s skip the wine.”

Gu Can refrained from saying more, maintaining a smile as he sat up straight.

Liu Zhimiao asked with a grin, “Master previously went out with a sect reverend and has formed some ties with General Su Gaoshan. Are you considering joining the military to seek a position as a martial officer?”

Gu Can shook his head with a smile, “Disciple wouldn’t waste Master’s offerings.”

Liu Zhimiao didn’t press further but suddenly sighed, “Gu Can, you aren’t even fourteen yet, right?”

Gu Can nodded.

Liu Zhimiao fell into silence for a moment, “If Master successfully breaks through to the upper fifth realm, as a reverend, I can make three requests of the Zhenjing Sect, which was promised by the Sect Leader Jiang long ago. I plan to ask the Zhenjing Sect to grant you the vassal islands including Qingxia Island and Suling Island.”

Gu Can maintained a calm demeanor, not rushing to respond.

Liu Zhimiao continued, “Master considers not only you, my favored disciple, but also has my own selfish motives. I don’t want the incense of the Qingxia lineage to be extinguished. With you at Qingxia Island, the ancestral hall won’t be considered closed. Even if in the end, few remain at Qingxia Island, it doesn’t matter. This way, I, the island master of Qingxia, can wholeheartedly serve Jiang Shangzhen and the Zhenjing Sect.”

Gu Can asked, “What does Master need from disciple? Please speak freely. I won’t say any flowery words like I’ll die without hesitation. What I can do, I will, and will try to do it even better.”

Liu Zhimiao looked pleased, stroking his beard while smiling. After a moment’s thought, he said slowly, “Help the ancestral hall of Qingxia Island branch out. It’s that simple. But let me make it clear beforehand—aside from that true Nascent Soul reverend Li Fuju, I’m not familiar with any other reverends, large or small. I even have potential enemies. Jiang Shangzhen has never truly confided in me. So taking over the ancestral hall of Qingxia Island and several vassal islands isn’t entirely a good thing. You need to weigh the pros and cons carefully. After all, sudden wealth can be deadly. You are the only disciple I regard highly; that’s why I speak frankly with you.”

Gu Can replied, “Then I’ll think it over thoroughly and can give Master a clear answer within three days at the latest.”

Liu Zhimiao nodded, “That’s best. Be cautious; fear of death leads to hesitation, while risking your life for big gains is the foundation of our mountain cultivators.”

Gu Can nodded, “Master’s teachings, I will remember.”

At this point, Gu Can chuckled, “In the past, I thought I understood everything, but really, I understood nothing. I was foolish and ignorant, making a fool of Master.”

Liu Zhimiao laughed, “Those who proudly proclaim they understand everything are usually the least informed. In truth, your actions back then may have seemed reckless, but they weren’t as disgraceful as you thought. As long as you survived, all the hardships you endured are the true foundation of a mountain cultivator. The wisdom of swallowing bitterness is the real understanding.”

Gu Can responded with a hum.

Liu Zhimiao took out an ancient book made of what appeared to be gold and jade, its surface shimmering with light, the title written in four golden ancient characters: “Jiejiang True Scripture.”

Liu Zhimiao extended his fingers, gently pushing the book toward the composed youth in the green robe, speaking in a deep voice, “In the past, the techniques Master taught you were merely the foundational methods of Qingxia Island’s ancestral hall, considered side doors. Only this celestial secret manual is truly the essence of Master’s great path. To be honest, I was once afraid and unwilling to pass this method to you, fearing you would team up with that little mudfish to kill me.”

After presenting the ancient manual he had cherished for hundreds of years, Liu Zhimiao didn’t glance at it again. “Times have changed. If I break through to the upper fifth realm, everything will be easier to discuss. If, unfortunately, I die, there will be no more Liu Zhimiao in this world, and you needn’t worry about settling scores with me.”

Gu Can didn’t reach for the nearly priceless celestial tome but stood up and bowed to Liu Zhimiao once more.

Liu Zhimiao remained seated at the main table, returning the bow from his disciple.

The intricate dynamics of their master-disciple relationship had been filled with schemes over the years.

Tonight, this exchange of a book and bow was quite pure, just the most straightforward transmission of the way in the world of cultivation.

After tonight, the existing complexities of old debts and calculations between master and disciple would likely continue to persist.

Gu Can tucked the celestial manual into his sleeve.

Liu Zhimiao chuckled, “Your senior sister Tian and the other brothers are all increasingly foolish.”

Gu Can smiled, “They brought this misfortune upon themselves; they can’t blame others.”

Liu Zhimiao pondered for a moment, “Go get two jars of wine; let’s chat a bit longer. We can drink and enjoy ourselves, no need to be polite.”

The main door remained open, and moonlight streamed into the room.

Gu Can went to the kitchen, making two trips to bring back two jars of hometown wine gifted by Dong Shuijing, two white bowls, and a few plates of side dishes.

Liu Zhimiao poured a bowl of wine, picked up a crispy dried fish from Shujian Lake, chewed thoughtfully, and took a sip of wine.

This was the flavor of humanity.

Although there was great hope for his breakthrough, and Jiang Shangzhen would spare no effort to assist him, ensuring the Zhenjing Sect would gain another Jade Purity stage reverend, nothing was guaranteed.

This meal under the moonlight might very well be Liu Zhimiao’s last supper in this life.

Liu Zhimiao chuckled, “Back then, the ten heroes of Shujian Lake you stirred up were known by many, but it was really just you nine. I’d wager that even now, few could guess that the last one was that accountant at the gate of Qingxia Island. What a pity; it should have been a grand tale in the making.”

Liu Zhimiao propped one foot on a stool, squinting as he sipped his wine, and started counting with his hand, “The scourge of Qingxia Island, Gu Can; the Lord of Suling Island, Tian Hujun; the fourth senior brother, Qin Jue; the sixth senior brother, Chao Zhe; the young lord of Chishui City, Fan Yan; Lu Caisang of Huangli Island; Yuan Yuan of Guming Island; the exiled prince Han Jingling; and the son of the general, Huang He.”

Liu Zhimiao remarked, “Your senior sister Tian has visited Gongliu Island twice, but I haven’t seen her. The first time she lingered by the border for a day and night, only to return disappointed. The second time, she became increasingly fearful of death and wanted to storm Gongliu Island, risking half her life for a chance at a full one. But alas, as her cold-hearted master, I still didn’t bother to see her. That half-life she risked was wasted. What do you plan to do with her? Will you beat her or kill her?”

Gu Can smiled and said, “Master’s kind intentions are to lead Senior Sister Tian to a dead end, hoping that I, Gu Can, and future Qingxia Island might gain a talented and sensible person.”

Liu Zhimiao replied, “In dealing with Tian Hujun, your previous methods were not bad, but it’s like…”

At this point, Liu Zhimiao pointed at the dishes on the table, “Just drinking without side dishes can make the taste much poorer. It’s easy to say, but hard to do; you can learn from me and my old brother Zhang Ye. This is one of the few good intentions I have. In reality, it’s proven that instead of seeking simplicity with a one-size-fits-all approach, applying benevolence and coercion, tempting with benefits, is essential. The incense of any mountain sect cannot last long.”

Gu Can nodded, “Different people need different incentives, of course, whether it be fame, wealth, magical artifacts, or opportunities for cultivation. Fishing for people’s hearts is a great art.”

Liu Zhimiao laughed heartily, “No wonder I heard that you’ve taken a liking to fishing by the lake, even if the catch isn’t big; you go every time.”

Liu Zhimiao’s joy was not over Gu Can’s seemingly trivial pursuits but because Gu Can had finally learned the art of moderation, understanding the timing of heartfelt exchanges instead of believing that shedding the luxurious dragon-skin robe for a coarse blue robe was enough for everyone to trust that Gu Can had turned over a new leaf and become a kind-hearted youth. If that were the case, it would only indicate that Gu Can had grown since those days, but not by much. He still habitually took others for fools, and where would that lead him?

Fan Yan from Chishui City, acting like a fool, had simply pinpointed Gu Can’s soft spot, and back then, had been able to toy with Gu Can as easily as walking a dog.

Since Liu Zhimiao could offer that “Jiejiang True Scripture,” he could easily take it back at any time.

Thus, Liu Zhimiao would have to put Gu Can to the test regarding his character.

That Tian Hujun, who was destined to be inconsequential, would merely become a side dish on the table tonight.

But the Jiejiang True Monarch wasn’t in a hurry.

This was just the beginning of their drinking.

Liu Zhimiao casually remarked, “Fan Yan has long been the true decision-maker behind the scenes in this Chishui City; you’ve noticed, right?”

Gu Can smiled wryly, “Master, I’m not blind.”

Liu Zhimiao chuckled, “Then have you noticed that Fan Yan already has connections in the court? It’s neither General Guan Yiran, the direct descendant of the old Minister of the Li Department, nor General Su Gaoshan, who was the first to breach the capital of the Zhu Ying Dynasty.”

Gu Can considered, “I’ll just endure him a bit longer.”

He hoped that by then, Fan Yan and his parents would still be alive, preferably in a prosperous and thriving family.

Liu Zhimiao continued, “Yuan Yuan was born with good fortune, as his parents were both Golden Elixirs, and the support of Guming Island. To be precise, it’s Yuan Yuan’s mother’s backing, a Nascent Soul sword cultivator from the Zhu Ying Dynasty. Yet he was chased for thousands of miles by an enigmatic young man in white and Ruan Xiu of Longquan Sword Sect, ultimately being killed near the border. Logically, Guming Island should have perished, but now they’ve secured a reverend from the Zhenjing Sect and even obtained the Taiping Wushi talisman from the Great Li’s court.”

Gu Can didn’t hold much animosity towards this chubby little Yuan Yuan. How clever could a braggart be, flaunting his cunning? 

Guming Island’s opportunism was nothing remarkable; anyone could do it.

As long as this fellow didn’t provoke him again, letting him be a guest of Qingxia Island would pose no problems. 

As for Yuan Yuan’s sneering remarks behind his back, how much weight could those words carry?

Gu Can had heard worse insults throughout his life.

Now, Gu Can wouldn’t be driven to kill out of spite.

At least not for the moment.

And this “moment” might stretch out to be extraordinarily long.

But Gu Can could wait; he had that patience.

For he had learned one truth: when you can only break rules without the power to establish them, you must first adhere to the rules. During this period, not dying after suffering hardships is an invisible gain. Because Gu Can can learn more, every bump and bruise, every wall he hits and closed door he faces, is a lesson about the rules of the world.

Liu Zhimiao said, “Han Jingling, the new emperor of Shihai Kingdom, is truly remarkably fortunate.”

Han Jingling ignored the plight of the commoners under the vassal kings and fled to Shujian Lake. Miraculously, he became a widely praised sage king, donned the dragon robe, and sat on the dragon throne—he probably laughed in his sleep for two years. Meanwhile, the once-promising prince, Han Jingxin, perished in the wilderness beyond the capital, so this new emperor’s position is quite stable. Huang He, who helped elevate Han Jingling to the throne, also isn’t doing too badly. As a young Vice Minister of Rites, he was conferred the title of the new Five Peaks of Shihai Kingdom, accompanying the new emperor everywhere. The Minister of Rites doesn’t even dare to complain, and when he arrives at the office, he even proactively serves tea. Huang He’s father is said to be the one who effectively crowned the emperor, although he isn’t wearing the dragon robe, he certainly can wield a sword in court.

Gu Can smiled, “Good fortune can also be a talent.”

This arrogant kid, Huang He, likely wouldn’t need Gu Can’s intervention; sooner or later, Han Jingling would deal with him in a far more severe manner.

Still, Gu Can hoped to get a hold of Huang He.

Because this was the only one who dared to step onto Qingxia Island and demand entry into that room after Gu Can had fallen into obscurity.

Gu Can was waiting for an opportunity.

And this opportunity had to be reasonable and within the rules.

After Liu Zhimiao finished naming everyone, Gu Can’s general attitude towards each individual was evident to the Jiejiang True Monarch.

He still held grudges.

Yet compared to his earlier recklessness, Gu Can had become clearer-headed. Not only could he endure without a word, but he also seemed to accept his current situation of being under someone else’s roof, bowing to others in all things, with no complaints, rather relishing the experience.

Excellent.

This could lead to living longer and better.

Among the immense hardships and difficulties, those who can endure the most intolerable sufferings will eventually see sweetness. 

This is another form of cultivation.

Liu Zhimiao never worried about Gu Can’s visible path of cultivation being fraught with obstacles.

This kid was a born wild cultivator, and perhaps one that could rival the seasoned Liu from Gongliu Island!

Liu Zhimiao poured himself another bowl of wine, asking, “How will you deal with those resentful spirits and ghosts? If it’s something you can’t speak of, you don’t have to.”

Gu Can had just lifted his wine bowl when he set it down, pausing before shaking his head, “There’s nothing I can’t say. If they die and become ghosts, with their only obsession being revenge, it’s simple. I’ll give them the chance to seek vengeance. You should already know, Master, that Sect Leader Jiang has carved out several islands with continuous mountains and rivers near Yunlou City, intending to hand them over to me, Gu Can. I’ll build a ghost cultivation sect there, where all the resentful spirits can cultivate. Need funds for cultivation? I, Gu Can, will provide! Need secret manuals? I’ll help find suitable ones. Whenever they feel ready for revenge, they just need to let me know. Besides that, for various requests and wishes, I will do as much as I can. I know many of these spirits are waiting for the right price; it’s all fine, as long as they’re willing to speak up.”

Liu Zhimiao suddenly laughed, “If back then, Chen Pingan could have killed you with a punch or a sword, wouldn’t it have been an easier choice for both of you?”

Gu Can lowered his head, lifting his bowl of wine, his wrist hovering, thinking for a moment before expressionlessly saying, “Chen Pingan isn’t that kind of person, and I wouldn’t want to die so early.”

When he lifted his head to drink, the youthful expression had returned to normal.

Liu Zhimiao chuckled dismissively.

In reality, Liu Zhimiao felt turmoil within.

He had no knowledge of the island's fate!

Liu Zhimiao sighed; thus the final test of Gu Can's character had some variables.

However, after weighing his thoughts, Liu Zhimiao still asked, “Where do you think Qingxia Island’s path lies? No rush; drink up and think it over.”

Gu Can set down his wine bowl, wiped his mouth, bent down, and plucked a small dried fish from the banquet table to chew slowly, then began to slowly articulate, “First, I can reach the upper fifth realm. Second, I’ll find a backing from the Great Li, at least a powerful family head from a prominent lineage. Third, through this backing, I’ll meet the Great Li emperor and become a pawn he can use to keep the Zhenjing Sect in check in Shujian Lake.”

Liu Zhimiao’s eyes sparkled, “How about a fourth?”

Gu Can smiled, “Let’s take it slow.”

Liu Zhimiao pressed on, “If you proceed with this plan, won’t it be ungrateful to me, your master, who serves as a reverend in the Zhenjing Sect, and to Jiang Shangzhen, who has given you the islands?”

Gu Can’s demeanor remained calm as he turned to look outside, “The long night stretches on; I can drink several bowls of wine and enjoy many dishes. Today, discussing this matter might seem like an act of ingratitude, but by the time I do this in the future, it may very well be a timely aid. Moreover, in the midst of this speech and action, there are countless dealings to be made. It’s possible that one day I, Gu Can, might just die.”

Liu Zhimiao, who rarely drank much at once but raised his cup frequently, now had only one final bowl of wine left. He downed it in one gulp.

At this juncture, it was no longer a mere exchange of sentiments.

Tonight’s gathering was indeed worth the trip.

Unbeknownst to Gu Can, seeing that Liu Zhimiao had finished his wine and there was no wine jug left, he stood up, took his own jug of wine, and poured another bowl for the elder.

Liu Zhimiao didn’t stop him.

After sitting down, Gu Can lifted what was also his last bowl of wine, saying to the elder, “Let’s discuss matters without sentiment; I, Gu Can, want to thank you, Master, for leading me out of Mud Bottle Lane back then, allowing me the opportunity to do so many things and live to this night to speak so much.”

Liu Zhimiao raised his wine bowl, clinking it with Gu Can’s, and they both drank their wine dry.

Liu Zhimiao stood up, and Gu Can followed suit.

They walked together to the door of the main house, standing shoulder to shoulder. Liu Zhimiao said with a smile, “If youths don’t enjoy themselves and don’t seek pleasures while young, they waste their golden time.”

Gu Can shook his head, “Youth is fleeting; how much time can we have?”

Liu Zhimiao raised an eyebrow, surprised. Turning his head, he smiled, “Have you read quite a bit?”

Gu Can nodded, “I’ve read the reports from the mountains and miscellaneous books from the lower world; I’m willing to read anything. After all, I’ve only attended a few days of school; it’s a bit of a regret. From Mud Bottle Lane to Shujian Lake, I haven’t moved much, so I want to learn more about the world through reports and books.”

Liu Zhimiao glanced at the bamboo fan at Gu Can’s waist, smiling, “That’s a good item.”

Gu Can took the folding fan down, offering it to the elder, his eyes clear, “If Master likes it, take it.”

The moment this item was revealed, it signified that Gu Can had made a decision regarding a certain sacrifice.

Liu Zhimiao waved his hand, “Keep it for yourself. Who gave it to you?”

Gu Can replied, “A friend’s friend.”

A friend’s friend, not his own.

Even if that person was Liu Xianyang.

But Gu Can had never considered Liu Xianyang as a friend.

From childhood, Liu Xianyang was merely that person’s friend. Even Gu Can had to admit that Liu Xianyang was one of the few good-hearted people in his hometown.

But Gu Can would never regard Liu Xianyang as a friend.

He disliked Liu Xianyang’s carefree nature, especially when he made jokes about his mother, which led Gu Can to chase after Liu Xianyang a few times, crying and fighting.

Usually, in the end, Liu Xianyang would laugh and apologize.

Then, the tear-streaked little snot would walk back to Mud Bottle Lane with another person.

As they walked, that little snot would often laugh and shed his worries.

So he, Gu Can, only ever had one friend.

In the past, now, and for his entire life, it would always be so.

But he, Gu Can, would never become someone like that.

Gu Can is Gu Can.

There is only one Gu Can in this world.

Yet he is willing to change his words and actions.

And he learns quickly and adapts well.

Because that person said something when they parted ways.

A tree that stands out in the forest will be felled by the wind, which are two different principles.

Liu Zhimiao finally asked, “Gu Can, do you know what family foundation means?”

Gu Can smiled, “Please enlighten me, Master.”

Liu Zhimiao said, “It’s not the vast wealth of a wealthy merchant, nor the vast fields of a rich family, nor is it the many officials and generals in the bureaucracy, nor is it the clouds of immortals in the mountains.”

Liu Zhimiao only said half of it and still didn’t provide an answer.

Gu Can pondered it over, nodding, “Understood. It’s a family that, after making a grave mistake, can restore itself, not one that vanishes without a trace.”

Liu Zhimiao expressed regret, “I, Liu Zhimiao, was unable to do so. After this calamity, I ended up disappointing Zhang Ye. Even if I miraculously become a Jade Purity cultivator, I am merely a hound for the sect’s ledger.”

Gu Can smiled, “Qingxia Island still has me, Gu Can.”

Liu Zhimiao shook his head, “It’s that Shujian Lake still has you, Gu Can!”

Mountain cultivators, grievances are clearly defined.

Even between master and disciple, it is the same.

Liu Zhimiao vanished, returning to the ancestral hall of the Zhenjing Sect on Gongliu Island, where he began his seclusion.

Gu Can did not sleep all night.

He merely strolled slowly in the small courtyard.

Although Liu Zhimiao had concealed the words and actions within the house, the elder didn’t deliberately hide when he stepped out.

Thus, both Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi naturally learned of the Jiejiang True Monarch’s arrival and departure.

Ma Duyi opened the window, looking around before making eye contact with Gu Can, silently asking if there was trouble.

Gu Can smiled and waved his hand, signaling her not to worry.

As for Zeng Ye, being timid and naive, he remained hidden in the house, feeling anxious to himself.

However, cultivation is a strange matter. Zeng Ye had great foundational skills but Ma Duyi’s aptitude for cultivation was better, while Zeng Ye had better opportunities, and Ma Duyi’s character was evidently more pleasant.

In the end, Zeng Ye was more likely to reach greater heights.

Fortunately, Ma Duyi, who had died once, didn’t care much about these things.

So sometimes, Gu Can envied Zeng Ye’s naïveté and also envied Ma Duyi’s worry-free nature.

Zeng Ye tossed and turned, eventually falling into a deep sleep.

Gu Can sighed; if this Zeng Ye had practiced in the Shujian Lake of the past, even with his current level of cultivation, he would still have walked into a tiger’s den, leaving no bones behind.

Through the various banquets at the General’s mansion, Gu Can had noticed a clue.

The rules of Shujian Lake had been established, and that young general Guan Yiran, destined to come from a wealthy family, had likely received an accounting book in advance because Gu Can felt a sense of familiarity.

Thus, in today’s Shujian Lake, the traces of that accountant from Qingxia Island were everywhere.

Gu Can held the folding fan, gently tapping his shoulder, muttering to himself, “There’s still much to learn.”

This fan crafted from Shenxiao bamboo had inscriptions on both sides.

“Clear Breeze, Bright Moon. Five Thunder Eruptions.”

This should have been personally written by Liu Xianyang, a show of his scholarly pursuits to display to Gu Can.

However, Gu Can had always felt that if Liu Xianyang had gone to the same school as that person, he would have only been left behind, eating dust.

But fate had allowed that person to roam the world, while Liu Xianyang pursued his studies.

Thus, Gu Can had never quite liked this world.

As for that celestial manual hidden in his sleeve, Gu Can had not opened it that night.

Do I, Gu Can, need to rush my cultivation?

At dawn, Gu Can opened the door, sitting on the steps outside. The door gods and spring couplets had been purchased last year.

Once a snot-nosed kid had vowed to hang the spring couplets he wrote on a certain house in Mud Bottle Lane.

At that time, the person must have been very happy, rubbing the snot-nose’s head, saying this year, he’d pay for the spring couplets for both families.

Wasn’t that nonsense?

Ever since that kid became an apprentice at the dragon kiln, the family at the end of Mud Bottle Lane had received spring couplets purchased by him every time.

The poorer people often spent more money on others.

What a strange phenomenon.

How could such people exist in the world?

Gu Can sat at the bottom of the steps, resting his elbow on the step above, quietly waiting for the door of the small family across the way to open.

Because there was a brat over there, who always had two sticky little dragons on his face.

That was why Gu Can chose to rent a house here.

Across the way was a poor family, both parents working to make a living, with a kid who had just started school not long ago. He had an older sister who wasn’t particularly pretty, and her name wasn’t pleasant either. The delicate and shy girl easily blushed and would lower her head and walk quickly whenever she saw him.

Gu Can certainly wouldn’t like such a common girl.

A boisterous child preparing to go to school swaggered out, sniffling upon seeing Gu Can, stepping back two paces, standing on the threshold, “Hey, Gu, what are you looking at? My sister is such a beauty; how could a poor boy like you have eyes for her? I advise you to give up on that thought; you’re not worthy of my sister! I don’t want to call you brother-in-law.”

Gu Can straightened up, gently tapping his knee with the bamboo fan.

The kid couldn’t help but glance at the fan a few more times, jumping down from the threshold to sit beside Gu Can, extending his hand, “Let me play with it.”

Gu Can teased, “Shouldn’t you go study your classics?”

The kid rolled his eyes, “Those classics won’t run away. I’ll go later and tell the teacher my stomach hurts.”

Gu Can squinted, “You better smear some mud on your butt before heading to class, otherwise the teacher won’t believe you.”

The kid pondered for a moment, then suddenly erupted into a curse, “Gu, are you stupid? The teacher won’t beat me; if I dirty my pants and go home, my mom will probably kill me!”

After cursing, the kid asked, “Hey, Gu, can you teach me some fancy words? So I can show off to my two friends.”

Gu Can casually recited, “The old man at the east village guards against the tiger, as the tiger enters his room, he bites its head. The child of the west family doesn’t recognize the tiger, wields a stick to drive it away like it’s a cow.”

The kid fumed, “So many words? I need something shorter, more impactful!”

Gu Can said, “A boy sharpens his knife at night; whoever dares defy me will die standing or kneeling.”

The kid frowned, “That’s too murderous; I’m afraid of getting beaten. But I could say it to those who can’t outrun me.”

Gu Can burst into laughter, slapping the kid’s head, “You’re so clever, just like I was as a child.”

Gu Can stopped laughing, “Forget that nonsense; just forget it after hearing it. I’ll teach you a phrase that has more bravado.”

The kid eagerly nodded, “Hurry up!”

Gu Can said seriously, “Every night, the bed is chilly.”

The kid, blushing with anger, slapped the boy’s shoulder, “You’re the one who wets the bed!”

Gu Can suddenly asked, “By the way, the teacher doesn’t hit you? Don’t you often go home crying, saying that old bastard loves to hit you with the board?”

The kid shrugged, laughing, “You don’t know? We changed to a new teacher at school. The old one was so annoying; he never beat the good students, only targeted us who didn’t study well, beating us like we stole something from his house. I was thinking of growing a bit bigger, not a child anymore, and once I had some strength, I’d secretly beat him up. But now, this new one is great; he never beats anyone and doesn’t even care about us. Life is so comfortable now!”

Gu Can chuckled, “So you like the new teacher better now?”

The kid froze, “Hey, Gu, did you hit your head on the door this morning? Why are you asking such dumb questions? If you were to go to school, wouldn’t you like the new teacher? Now we can mess around as long as we don’t disturb the obedient students. The new teacher never cares about us; he doesn’t even beat or scold us!”

Gu Can leaned back, smiling, “A teacher who only cares for good students can be called a good teacher? What do teachers in this world need to do?”

The kid sighed dramatically, “Gu, your brain is really fried. Actually, I used to want you and my sister to be together, but now I’ve given up. If I don’t study hard, what if one day my brother-in-law isn’t up to par?”

Gu Can smiled, “How do you know you won’t excel in your studies? I think you’re quite clever.”

The kid drooped his head, “Not only the new teacher but the old teacher also said I’m hopeless, just a waste. The old teacher beat me every time he scolded me. He hit me the hardest; I hate him!”

Gu Can ruffled the kid’s hair, “When you grow up, if you see those two teachers on the street, you can ignore the new one. After all, he’s just a hired hand, not really a teacher. But if you run into that old teacher, make sure to call him ‘Sir.’”

The kid suddenly looked up, indignantly retorting, “Why should I!? I won’t!”

Gu Can looked up at the sky, “Just because that teacher still has hope for you.”

The kid was left puzzled, feeling misty after a lengthy pause. He tentatively asked, “Have you been beaten hard by a particularly bad-tempered teacher too?”

Gu Can nodded, softly saying, “But he had a good temper.”

The kid gasped, “How pitiful! You’re not much better off than I am! Hey, I’m better off; the old teacher is no longer around, and the new one doesn’t hit people.”

The kid stood up, wiped his face, secretly rubbed against Gu Can’s shoulder, and fled.

Gu Can turned to look, seeing only the kid’s snot.

Gu Can quietly shook his clothes, dispersing the traces.

He stood up, returned to the house, and closed the door behind him, tucking the folding fan back into his waist.

Many people would die, and inevitably, there would only be more in the future. But the precondition was that Gu Can must first survive, to later use so-called good deeds to accumulate power, complemented by clever methods of managing people’s hearts, and then kill according to the rules. Although it wasn’t particularly satisfying, what else could he say? He did good deeds and killed bad people, and he killed in such a way that even Chen Pingan couldn’t find any fault!

Gu Can leaned against the door.

Yet he felt a bit sorrowful.

Because that snot-nosed kid from Mud Bottle Lane was, in fact, truly dead.

In Chen Pingan’s heart, in Gu Can’s heart, he had died.

But what saddened Gu Can even more was another possibility.

That he had never changed.

But that Chen Pingan was no longer that grass-soled youth from Mud Bottle Lane; he had changed too much.

Regardless of how it turned out, no matter who had changed.

Gu Can.

Can.

That person, so full of hope, the beautiful jade that once shone, was forever lost.

The room sounded with a door opening.

Gu Can instantly removed the folding fan, snapping it open to cover his face.

Moments later, Gu Can closed the fan, his smile radiant, greeting, “Zeng Ye.”

Zeng Ye smiled and scratched his head, responding with a soft “Mm.”

In truth, his forehead and palms were all sweaty.

Gu Can walked into the main room, diving into his studies. 

(End of Chapter)


 ### Chapter 632: The Kites in the Sky Have Their Differences (Part 1)

On Gongliu Island, even at the end of autumn, the willows still swayed gracefully.

This island was the main peak of the True Realm Sect, the very site where the Ancestor Hall was constructed. Throughout this year, the entire area around Shujian Lake, including Gongliu Island, had been bustling with construction. Dust filled the air, blocking out the sun. The affluent True Realm Sect had employed numerous mechanists from the Mohist school and geomancers from the Yin-Yang school to survey the terrain, assess the water routes, and oversee the work of various craftsmen from mountain clans. As the sect leader Jiang Shangzhen put it, "Don’t you dare save on expenses for the immortals! Every tile, every window decoration, and every flowerbed must be the finest on Baoping Continent."

Among those especially skilled in crafting immortal residences were several hundred cultivators, the vast majority hailing from Tongye Continent. Just the cost of transporting them across continents via the intercontinental ferries, coupled with the True Realm Sect's comprehensive takeover of the project, meant that many old sects on the islands of Shujian Lake could go bankrupt overnight due to the amount of celestial money spent.

Thus, all the mountain cultivators on Baoping Continent became aware of a second piece of news: the True Realm Sect was wealthy to an outrageous degree.

The first piece of news, of course, was that the True Realm Sect had three and a half offerings at the upper fifth realm. One was a female sword immortal named Li Cai from the North Julu Continent, who had once hoped to assume the position of sect leader. The second was the elder Liu Lao Cheng from the Yuguizong, and the half offering was the True Monarch of the Jiang River from Qingxia Island.

Now that Liu Zhimo had begun his seclusion to break through, the islands surrounding Gongliu Island had recently been sealed off.

Two individuals strolled slowly along the willow-lined banks: Sect Leader Jiang Shangzhen and Chief Offering Liu Lao Cheng.

Jiang Shangzhen plucked a willow branch and wove it into a ring, placing it on his own head. He smiled and said, "In the past, I was like this. Right, Brother Liu?"

Liu Lao Cheng remained silent.

Jiang Shangzhen was a peculiar kind of hero; his methods were ruthless, adept at concealing daggers beneath his smile. Yet, he placed great importance on rules. This feeling wasn’t conveyed through Jiang Shangzhen’s words, but rather by the fact that this location, chosen by Yuguizong for its sect, was meant to communicate this principle to the sect cultivators. Of course, many of the rules Jiang Shangzhen established were quite unyielding.

As a result, General Guan Yiran of the Great Li Iron Cavalry had negotiated with the True Realm Sect multiple times, while Yuan Ying Offering Li Fuju often had to argue with the general’s office. Both parties would become red-faced, banging the table and glaring at each other. Luckily, they had argued without resorting to violence.

It wasn’t that Li Fuju had a particularly good temper; rather, Jiang Shangzhen had warned this woman, who seemed to represent the True Realm Sect, that her life was of little value—just as the sect’s face was also of little value. In this world, what truly held value was only money.

Jiang Shangzhen’s earlier remark, "In the past, I was like this," meant something rather simple. The fact that he was willing to openly discuss this matter with Liu Lao Cheng indicated that he was aware of Liu’s past entanglements with love and hatred. Jiang Shangzhen reassured Liu that he would not engage in any underhanded actions against him.

Liu Lao Cheng, feeling reassured, did not hold back.

As for Liu Zhimo successfully breaking through, the True Realm Sect's upper fifth realm offerings had dwindled to three.

Because that high-ranking member of the Yuguizong, who had publicly claimed to be in seclusion, or more accurately, the elder from the Tongye Sect, was now dead beyond resurrection.

At the time, they had set up a formation to jointly kill him, but only two had actually made a move.

Liu Lao Cheng and Liu Zhimo had merely acted as anchors, or one could say, they had just watched the performance.

To kill a chicken to scare the monkeys.

Right here on Gongliu Island.

Li Cai and Jiang Shangzhen, one drew a sword from its sheath, the other summoned a willow leaf. That old acquaintance who had brought a heavy treasure from the Tongye Sect to join the Yuguizong, upon seeing Li Cai, didn’t even entertain the thought of perishing with Jiang Shangzhen, the madman. Unfortunately, he failed to escape and thus died.

The fight lacked any dramatic flair; even many cultivators on Gongliu Island merely sensed a momentary change in the atmosphere, and then the world fell silent, the clouds light, and the moon bright.

Jiang Shangzhen suddenly said, "In the future, when encountering the Daoists of the Divine Decree Sect, let our True Realm Sect disciples show some respect. They should act with their tails tucked between their legs. Regardless of right or wrong, as long as there’s a confrontation, if someone dies, the True Realm Sect will treat it as though nothing happened. If someone accidentally kills the opponent, the True Realm Sect will behead this so-called hero and send the head to the Divine Decree Sect as an apology."

Liu Lao Cheng nodded, "Understood."

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, "Are you not quite understanding?"

Liu Lao Cheng shook his head.

It wasn’t difficult to understand.

The taller the tree, the more the wind blows; becoming a target for all.

The True Realm Sect had no connections on Baoping Continent. Although it appeared to be prosperous, it was, in reality, surrounded by enemies, such as the Great Li Song family’s iron cavalry.

However, understanding aside, Jiang Shangzhen, this young sect leader, was willing to bow down to this extent, which Liu Lao Cheng found somewhat admirable.

This master of a vast celestial ground was indeed more unruly than the wild cultivators of the mountains.

Jiang Shangzhen sighed, "My current situation is actually similar to yours and Liu Zhimo’s; we need to grow stronger and accumulate power while making our opponents feel they can control us. What remains unclear is which individual the Great Li Song family will eventually send to hinder our True Realm Sect. The only drawback of Baoping Continent is this: the Song family is the ruler of a continent, a secular dynasty, and they have hopes of completely controlling both the mountains and the world below. If it were Tongye Continent, with the sky high and the emperor small, the cultivators in the mountains would truly be at ease."

Liu Lao Cheng chuckled, "The old Shujian Lake was actually like that too; the kings and nobles of surrounding nations were all on edge."

Jiang Shangzhen shook his head, "Not the same. A place like Shujian Lake, which lacks rules, resembles the barbarous lands of ancient times. With myriad demons running rampant, the gods in the heavens feed on human incense, and the demon races on the ground feed on people, thus the separation of virtue and saintly beings. It’s not just foolish people who are ignorant of their blessings; in fact, almost all of us fall into this category."

Jiang Shangzhen walked slowly, "Today, when our common folk talk about deities, flower spirits, wood charms, strange creatures, and ghostly beings, what are they? They are far removed in the high heavens and in the shadows, in scarcely visited mountains, lakes, and marshes. Even if there are those who live among us, they are still bound by unimaginably complex rules. Thus, we hear the saying that where demons cause trouble, the Heavenly Masters draw their swords. In the urban alleys, there are peach charms, door gods, and ancestral temples filled with incense, where one can pray for blessings and exorcise disasters, and there are opportunities to visit the mountains and seek immortals."

Jiang Shangzhen stopped, looked around, removed the willow ring, and casually tossed it into the lake. "So, if one day we, whether commoners or cultivators, must reverse our positions with them, what kind of situation will that be? Are you afraid? As for me, Jiang Shangzhen, I am afraid."

Liu Lao Cheng replied, "I won’t think about these things."

Jiang Shangzhen nodded, "That’s fine. Because some will think about it. So, you and Liu Zhimo can focus on your own cultivation. Because even if the world turns upside down in the future, you’ll still be able to find refuge and survive. With sufficient cultivation, there will always be an escape route and a way to live. And no matter how bad the world becomes, it seems there will always be someone to cushion the fall for you and Liu Zhimo; you two are born to live a life of comfort. Hmm, just like me, I can make money standing, and I can also make money lying down."

Liu Lao Cheng frowned.

Jiang Shangzhen chuckled, "But what if all the cultivators on the mountain tops think like you, Liu Lao Cheng?"

Liu Lao Cheng shook his head, "They won’t."

Jiang Shangzhen scratched his head, sighing, "So that’s the most interesting part; all the good we take for granted, there’s no need to think too much about it. Those bad things, we grit our teeth and can think about them for a long time."

Liu Lao Cheng was somewhat puzzled, not knowing what this sect leader aimed to convey with these words.

Jiang Shangzhen had already shifted the topic, appearing relaxed, without the unusual tension from before, his steps light. "In martial tales, a hero's friends always do good deeds, and even if they die, they die for a good reason. In tales of gods and spirits, human hearts fluctuate, and ghosts run rampant; there’s always retribution for both good and evil. Liu Lao Cheng, do you read these miscellaneous books?"

Liu Lao Cheng shook his head, "Never."

Jiang Shangzhen laughed, "Then you should read more."

Liu Lao Cheng knew that the sect leader was joking and naturally did not take it seriously.

This sect leader was bored every day; outside of cultivation, he would cast illusions and wander among the four great cities by Shujian Lake. Each time he returned, he would buy some toys for the child of the sword immortal Li Cai, teasing the child and teaching him to walk. Jiang Shangzhen could spend a long time on this, and sometimes even Liu Lao Cheng would feel frustrated, wondering whether it was Jiang Shangzhen’s inscrutable nature that had allowed him to reach his current position or whether it was the change of heart and temperament after ascending that had led him to become the sect leader of the True Realm Sect today.

Jiang Shangzhen approached a ferry dock. "Before Liu Zhimo entered seclusion, he asked me for the old territories, including Qingxia Island and Su Lin Island. He plans to give them to his disciple Gu Can. Little did he know, that territory near Yunlou City was specifically allocated for Gu Can by me. Yet, that young lad dared to accept it after hearing this, truly a case of 'the timid starves, the bold survives.'"

Liu Lao Cheng remarked, "This kid staying at Shujian Lake might be a hidden danger for the True Realm Sect."

Jiang Shangzhen turned his head, a playful smile on his face.

Liu Lao Cheng candidly added, "Naturally, it’s not just about the enmity between me, him, and Qingxia Island. I, Liu Lao Cheng, and the True Realm Sect would not want to see Gu Can quietly rise to power; nurturing a tiger brings disaster, and that is a great taboo."

Not just that.

Jiang Shangzhen laughed, "What do you think Gu Can's greatest support is?"

Liu Lao Cheng replied, "Of course, it’s the Chen Ping’an who is no longer in Shujian Lake, along with the rules he taught him. Guan Yiran, who has a good relationship with Chen Ping’an, or others I may not know, will definitely keep an eye on Gu Can’s every move. This means that Guan Yiran will also be watching me, Liu Zhimo, and the True Realm Sect. Gu Can should have already thought of this."

Regarding the so-called nurturing a tiger that brings disaster, Jiang Shangzhen remained noncommittal.

Although Liu Zhimo's realm was lower than Liu Lao Cheng's, he had often dealt with the Great Li court and had once aspired to be a legitimate ruler of Shujian Lake, so he saw some things more clearly than Liu Lao Cheng. Ultimately, it involved Liu Zhimo's interests, so his thoughts were more elaborate; while Liu Lao Cheng, as a wild cultivator, pursued the Great Dao, his thoughts were naturally purer and less cluttered.

In fact, before Liu Zhimo entered seclusion, he found Gu Can in a humble dwelling in Poolwater City.

Jiang Shangzhen could guess the reason behind it.

To impart knowledge and teachings.

Asking for the territory of Qingxia Island from the True Realm Sect was a means of long-term protection for Gu Can.

Because Liu Zhimo had also guessed Jiang Shangzhen’s long-term plans.

Rather than letting the Great Li Song family support an unknown force against the True Realm Sect, it was better for the True Realm Sect to send suitable candidates right to their doorstep.

For both parties, this was the most sensible choice without "internal strife."

Jiang Shangzhen had strutted into Longquan County twice; those with keen eyes would not fail to notice. This was something Jiang Shangzhen intentionally wanted others to ponder.

The down-and-out Chen Ping’an from Laopo Mountain.

Jiang Shangzhen of the True Realm Sect.

The bridge between them was Qingxia Island and Gu Can.

Thus, the True Realm Sect's true challenges never lay with Gu Can, Shujian Lake, or even the Divine Decree Sect.

But rather, in facing two major forces: one was the Great Li Iron Cavalry swallowing a continent, and then blocking another even greater force.

Only then would it be a critical moment for the True Realm Sect to transition from choice to decision.

However, none of this was known to Liu Lao Cheng or even Liu Zhimo; they were completely in the dark. The vast True Realm Sect stood before the two wild cultivators, and would they ponder deeply about matters seemingly unrelated to them?

Wild cultivators, aside from having some cultivation weight and a slightly larger fist, what else did they understand?

Having endured enough disdain and oppression from celestial lineage cultivators, yet in the end, they foolishly thought that cultivation was everything.

They wouldn't take the time to consider why the Yuguizong had a sect leader about to ascend, or why Jiang Shangzhen could possess the current estate he had. The order of precedence must not be mistaken. The strictly regulated three teachings and hundred schools had all originated from humble beginnings, struggling for survival on the earth. Who hadn’t been a puppet in the hands of deities?

Jiang Shangzhen did not look down on the wild cultivators of the world; in fact, he had spent many years as a wild cultivator during his travels in North Julu Continent, and had done quite well.

Jiang Shangzhen gazed at the rippling waters of Shujian Lake and softly said, "The teachers’ yardsticks are not too many, but too few. They strike too lightly; disciples often have poor memories and forget the beatings. Yet, no one considers whether the teachers have their own worries about daily sustenance, or whether one day, they might simply say they’re disappointed. All those who like to calmly discuss reason, once disappointed, fall into true despair."

Liu Lao Cheng still felt little impact from this.

Jiang Shangzhen suddenly turned and asked, "A sect leader of the upper fifth realm lays bare his heart to you, and you don’t have to listen carefully. What about an immortal?"

Liu Lao Cheng shivered.

Jiang Shangzhen grinned, "Ignorance is no crime, after all, as the sage said, 'To punish without teaching is cruelty.'"

Jiang Shangzhen rubbed his chin, "I originally shouldn’t have revealed the truth to you so early. The mountain treasure I hid on my maid Yaya is the real matter of life and death for you and Liu Zhimo. But I’ve changed my mind. Because I suddenly realized one thing: when reasoning with you wild cultivators, a fist is sufficient. Spending more thought is simply wasting my money."

Not time wasted in making money, but time wasted in spending money.

Liu Lao Cheng's expression remained unchanged, and he did not say another word.

The once familiar deadlock, the long-lost aura of danger.

Jiang Shangzhen sighed, "I always thought that everyone, whether good or bad, whether on the mountain or below, would become smarter once they reached a higher level. But after all these years, I’m quite disappointed. Liu Lao Cheng, if you don’t tighten your grip and truly immerse yourself in your heart, changing some fundamental thoughts and ideas, let alone catching up to me, even Liu Zhimo could leave you behind. Of course, there’s also that Gu Can; it’s only a matter of time. By then, you, the chief offering, would be a huge joke. The future will find Gu Can, who has always been like an ant, could never be killed, and Liu Zhimo would already stand on equal footing with you, while I, Jiang Shangzhen, would need to look up at him."

Jiang Shangzhen raised his hand, shook his sleeve, and casually spun, producing a green water bead condensed from the essence of water transport, then gently pinched it apart with his fingers. "Do you think that the accountant who came to the island to see you back then was looking up at you? No, what he respected and feared was the rules you had amassed at that time. But one day, perhaps not too far in the future, a few decades? A century? You, Liu Lao Cheng, could be standing atop Gongliu Island, yet that person standing at the ferry dock would make you feel shorter."

Liu Lao Cheng said, "I’ve learned a lot."

Jiang Shangzhen laughed, "Indeed, talking with an immortal is much more pleasant to hear. So you need to read more, and I need to cultivate harder."

Liu Lao Cheng let out a sigh.

Jiang Shangzhen inexplicably said, "Perhaps one day, I might return to Tongye Continent to take charge of Yuguizong. Then you would become the next sect leader of the True Realm Sect. As for Liu Zhimo, you could control him at the bottleneck of the upper fifth realm, preventing him from daring to break through to the immortal realm. If you feel good at that time and think he no longer poses a threat, you could generously allow him to ascend, letting him create a branch of the True Realm Sect on Baoping Continent."

Jiang Shangzhen kept his hands tucked in his sleeves. "This isn’t just painting a pie in the sky for you, Liu Lao Cheng; I’m not that lowly."

Liu Lao Cheng seemed to have gained some insight.

Now, the True Realm Sect had dedicated individuals collecting all the news from the mountains and rivers of Tongye Continent. Among them were rumors that the Yuguizong, which held the top position among immortals on Tongye Continent, might already have its sect leader in seclusion.

Pursuing the elusive realm of ascension.

As for the old sect leader Xun Yuan, Liu Lao Cheng was not unfamiliar, having traveled far on Baoping Continent together.

In fact, Liu Lao Cheng was originally appointed as an offering of the True Realm Sect by Xun Yuan.

However, on Jiang Shangzhen's side, this connection held no value whatsoever.

Liu Lao Cheng took a deep breath, feeling the vastness of the world, suddenly filled with ambition. He nodded solemnly, "Then from now on, I, Liu Lao Cheng, will sincerely fight for my True Realm Sect, risking my life!"

Jiang Shangzhen turned his head and gently patted Liu Lao Cheng’s shoulder, "We’re all family here. I may have said some harsh words earlier, so Brother Liu, don’t take offense."

Liu Lao Cheng hesitated for a moment.

Jiang Shangzhen said, "As family, you can certainly speak a few harsh words. Don’t mind it; I am a person who worries about nothing, only that I have too much money."

Liu Lao Cheng replied with a stern face, "Sect Leader Jiang, why are you so insufferable?"

Jiang Shangzhen rubbed his cheek, pondering for a moment, then suddenly realized, "Perhaps it’s because you’re not a woman."

 ### Chapter 633: The Kites in the Sky Have Their Differences (Part Two)

In the country of Qingluan, there was a strikingly handsome young man dressed in white, accompanied by an old man and a child, as they roamed through the picturesque landscapes of the half of the nation.

Previously, this young man had seized an opportunity in the hometown of Liu Laocheng, the only Fifth Stage wild cultivator from Baoping Continent. At the Bee Tail Ferry, he had acquired a deposed national seal from a man whose family had fallen on hard times. However, this seal belonged to the Kingdom of Wenjing, which had not been destroyed under the hooves of the Great Li's iron cavalry, but rather succumbed to the annals of history long before that.

The last prince of Wenjing seemed to have abandoned any thoughts of restoration. After all these years, he still had not descended the mountain, remaining in seclusion to cultivate. As a result, even if remnants of Wenjing's luck still lingered, it was effectively the end of the line for the kingdom. After all, any cultivator at the Fifth Stage could never become an emperor—this was an unbreakable law of the mortal realm.

Besides the low-priced national seal he had acquired, the young man also visited an old apricot tree known by several titles: "Emperor Wood," "Prime Minister Tree," and "General Apricot." He stood there, captivated, squatting at the tree's hollow and muttering to himself for quite some time.

Later on their journey, having obtained the national seal, the young man used the excuse of "collecting for completeness" to visit a certain mountaintop. There, he engaged in a game of chance with an elderly cultivator who walked the path of the dragon. After winning a wager, he raised the stakes again and again, narrowly emerging victorious each time, until finally, he had wagered everything and won the last two seals from a foreigner named Cui. This foreign man, driven by his gambling passion, foolishly declared he would bet his sixteen treasures against the last two seals, and, astonishingly, he won.

Thus, through sheer luck, the young man in white inexplicably acquired the remaining sixteen treasures of the Kingdom of Wenjing. With a swagger, he descended the mountain, stuffing those priceless national seals into a cotton bag, which a frail child was tasked with carrying. As they made their way down, the bag clinked and clanked.

The elderly servant, the Liuli Immortal, felt an uneasy chill as they traveled down. He worried that the protective mountain array would activate at any moment, leading to a chaotic ambush. Of course, who would be attacking whom was hard to say. The old cultivator was concerned that the treasures might misfire, and if Cui Daoshi failed to care for them, he could end up being mistakenly killed. The old cultivator understood well that the only person Cui Daoshi cared for was that muddle-headed child with cloudy eyes.

Fortunately, luck was on their side, and no one attacked them on the way down.

The trio walked quite a distance. They witnessed the so-called iron cavalry of the Kingdom of Yunxiao perform in the capital, enjoyed the Mid-Autumn Festival lantern fair in the capital of the Kingdom of Qingshan, and the old cultivator felt a twinge of regret for missing the emperor's eccentric preference for "plump beauties." Otherwise, it would have been a good opportunity to broaden his horizons. Nevertheless, Cui Daoshi purchased a popular book titled "Qian Ben Cao" (The Book of Money), which wasn't a rare edition but rather a common find in bookstores. He often perused it while walking along the mountain paths, claiming it had a bit of substance.

After crossing the border into Qingluan, Cui Daoshi began to move slower, frequently taking out a national seal and rubbing it against the face of the child he affectionately called "Little Gao."

The Liuli Immortal served as a portly servant, carrying an assortment of goods. Yet, he felt he was luckier than that frequently-mounted "Little Gao," so he often reminded himself to cherish his fortune.

As for Cui Daoshi's whimsical behaviors, the old cultivator had grown quite accustomed to them. For instance, during an encounter with a group of wild cultivators, one of whom was named Lu Yangzhen, they traveled together for a while. The Liuli Immortal couldn't understand what qualifications these mere wild cultivators had to engage in friendly conversation with Cui Daoshi. Eventually, they were granted an opportunity by Cui, who intentionally left behind a chance for them—a rain shelter cave. Accidentally triggering a mechanism inside, one of the array masters was incredibly fortunate, receiving a large stack of talismans known as Huangxi (Yellow Seals). If converted into divine currency, it would amount to a significant fortune, while Lu Yangzhen and his companions also enjoyed considerable gains. Those three must have felt as if they had stepped in dog poop only to discover gold hidden beneath.

As the Liuli Immortal observed the three wild cultivators rejoicing, he hesitantly suggested sharing some divine currency with Cui Daoshi, who unexpectedly accepted it with a look of "pleasant surprise" and "overwhelming gratitude." The Liuli Immortal was left feeling sour.

But what could he do? He decided to not think about it. The Liuli Immortal, a practitioner of the demonic path, had a clear understanding of certain matters.

As for the cosmetics shop in the Kingdom of Yunxiao, where many female cultivators gathered, the young man in white stood at the entrance with his hands on his hips, loudly hawking his divine spring palace illustrations. Naturally, no deals were struck, and he was soon chased down the mountain by a horde of furious female cultivators.

Such events were hardly worth mentioning.

The Liuli Immortal felt that he had made great strides in cultivating his heart along this journey!

Aside from these antics, Cui Daoshi occasionally grew serious, which left the old cultivator in awe. At the Golden Osmanthus Temple, Cui Daoshi sat down with the temple master to discuss the Dao. As their conversation deepened, the old master fell into a state of forgetfulness.

This master, named Zhang Guo, was at the Dragon Gate stage, and it seemed he was on the verge of advancing to the Golden Core stage.

The Liuli Immortal watched with envy.

At the White Water Temple, where water bubbled up from below, Cui Daoshi sat atop a well that had been inexplicably sealed, engaging in discourse with a young monk who preached more outside the temple than inside it.

Both were dressed in white.

One was a Confucian scholar, and the other a monk.

Initially, they debated the saying, "Any deviation from the classics is heresy." The Liuli Immortal found the discussion completely uninteresting.

The child, "Little Gao," squatted by the bamboo gate, listening to the various arguments within, occasionally babbling as he still could not speak properly.

Eventually, the young man in white, sitting cross-legged atop the well blocked by a blue stone, continued to chuckle and share a few Zen sayings: "To sever the tongues of all under heaven, shall we not sit and silence the world's voices? Should we not kick over the lotus seat and smash the Buddha's head?"

With that, he slapped down, shattering the blue stone that sealed the well.

The young man in white hovered above the well, laughing as he asked, "Does the old monk also have a cat's nature, afraid to call out in front of people?"

The white-clad monk lowered his head, clasping his hands together, and softly intoned a prayer.

Cui Daoshi chuckled again, "The Buddhist scriptures are heavy; only those who can carry them can let them go. There are two doors in the West; if you cannot see through them, you cannot open them."

The young monk raised his head, sharing a knowing smile, and slowly said, "A game as brilliant as you, the world is rare; a fool like me, there is none."

At that moment, the Liuli Immortal observed Cui Daoshi, who seemed to have said all he wanted, then jumped down from the well, laughing as he left. He playfully tapped the child's head, and the three departed from the White Water Temple.

As the young man in white swayed his large sleeves, he exclaimed, "If this stubborn stone refuses to nod, buried in the weeds and thorns and never encountering the unexpected, would it not be a great pity?!"

The Liuli Immortal, having not understood a word, feigned comprehension and nodded, "Master, you are indeed knowledgeable; I never thought you also possessed such profound Daoist wisdom and deep Buddhist understanding. You could certainly participate in debates among the Three Teachings!"

The young man in white laughed and scolded, "You speak nonsense!"

The Liuli Immortal felt a bit awkward but still nodded, "The Master is right."

Cui Daoshi turned, "You have quite a good mind; why not stay here and become a monk?"

The Liuli Immortal feigned despair, "I would rather not! I truly lack the aptitude to practice Buddhist teachings! Not even the slightest!"

Afterward, Cui Dongshan, accompanied by the old man and the child, visited the capital of Qingluan.

They met with the master of a small Daoist temple called the White Cloud Temple, which was a secluded place the size of a tofu block, adjacent to shabby alleys where chickens crowed and dogs barked amidst the laughter of children and vendors shouting their wares.

Cui Dongshan stayed there for several days, donating a considerable amount of incense money. Of course, he also borrowed and perused many books, as the temple master had a vast collection. This unremarkable middle-aged Daoist had accumulated nearly a million words of reading notes, which Cui Dongshan read even more. The temple master was generous and did not hoard his knowledge, glad to have someone peruse his works, especially since this foreign youth was a generous patron, ensuring that their White Cloud Temple would not face financial ruin.

On the morning of Cui Dongshan's departure, a young temple boy who had finally enjoyed a few days of heavenly life was genuinely reluctant to see him go, crying and sniffling. Even the temple master felt a twinge of sadness, questioning his own inadequacies as a master.

Cui Dongshan had not gone far when the young temple boy continued to grieve while sweeping the temple, distracted.

Then, seven or eight ox-drawn carts arrived outside the White Cloud Temple, claiming to deliver books.

The carts were filled with various texts from a hundred schools of thought, which were carried into the small temple box by box. The sight left the thin-faced middle-aged temple master utterly dumbfounded.

However, when the last cart unloaded a plaque, the temple master joyfully called over the ecstatic young temple boy to carefully carry it to the study.

The plaque bore two characters, "Zhai Xin" (Auspicious Heart).

After leaving the capital of Qingluan, the Liuli Immortal served as the driver for a horse cart, with Cui Dongshan sitting beside him and the child napping inside the cart.

The old cultivator softly asked, "Master, why do you hold the master of the White Cloud Temple, who is not a cultivator, in such high regard?"

Cui Dongshan waved his arms, one left and one right, one up and one down, as he said, "He is someone like my previous two teachers. In a time of peace, their greatness does not shine; but in tumultuous times, they become..."

The old cultivator waited for further elaboration, but there was only silence.

Just as he was about to give up on the answer, Cui Dongshan smiled, "The best teachers."

Cui Dongshan paused, then spoke slowly, "Ordinary teachers can help good students improve their studies; slightly better teachers help both good and poor students and are willing to guide people to correct their mistakes and do good. As for the very best teachers, they are those who wish to extend the greatest patience and kindness to great evils that arise from ignorance. Such people, regardless of where they are, their schools and the sound of books are always there. Some may find it noisy, but it doesn't matter; as long as someone can listen, that is sufficient."

Cui Dongshan suddenly stood up, raising his arm high as if holding a wine cup. At that moment, the young man in white stood tall, his spirit soaring, "In this world, there are many rich and indulgent things that everyone desires, and there is nothing wrong with that; it should be so. When thirsty, one can drink water, so help yourself—how delightful and fortunate is that?!"

The Liuli Immortal carefully drove the cart.

Alas.

Cui Daoshi spoke in such a way that left people puzzled.

Suddenly, the old cultivator received a kick from behind, and someone cursed, "Damn it, can’t you say a word of flattery or give a little applause?!"

The old cultivator was startled and hurriedly began drafting a response.

But such words of flattery were not easily conjured, and after such a scare, the Liuli Immortal could not come up with even one suitable compliment.

Fortunately, the person behind had already said, "Forget it; anyway, you won’t have the fortune to visit the Falling Dust Mountain in this lifetime."

The Liuli Immortal then felt a bit lighter.

Around the cart, paper birds folded from colored paper fluttered like real creatures, circling and spiraling around.

These were not the ordinary Yellow Seals that Fifth Stage cultivators purchased with great sums. Instead, they were made from a rare and precious material known as "Clear White Talismans," believed to be special talisman paper used by Daoist sects, extremely rare and expensive.

The old cultivator had some expertise in talismans. 

Therefore, he recognized that the most mysterious talisman paper was a type of blue talisman that contained the true essence of the sages, without a specific name.

Yet, these precious talismans were carelessly used to fold paper birds.

Cui Daoshi—was this appropriate?

It would be nice if you could give me a few as family heirlooms.

The old cultivator sighed deeply within.

Throughout this tumultuous journey, he had not truly gained any benefits; he could only hope that one day in the future, Cui Daoshi would acknowledge that he at least had some share in the labor despite not having any merit.

However, thinking of being a beast of burden lightened his mood a little.

The child in the cart was the true beast of burden.

Cui Dongshan suddenly said, "Let's take a detour; we're not going to the Liu family's Lion Garden. We're going to see a pitiful person."

Then the old cultivator followed the route provided by Cui Dongshan, steadily driving south.

Along the way in the Kingdom of Qingluan, there were many rumors about the Liu family's Lion Garden.

The head of the Liu family, a leader among scholars, had fallen from grace, his reputation tarnished. Once regarded as a national literary treasure, he had become a laughingstock, with his poetry and prose deemed worthless. There were even more scandals pouring down on him, and there was no escape—one of the four private gardens in Qingluan had turned into a den of filth. Various small bookstores in the city were filled with poorly printed scandalous pamphlets, circulating among officials and commoners alike.

Thus, when Liu Qingshan returned from his travels and held a wedding banquet at the Lion Garden, marrying an unknown woman from outside, the old Minister Liu did not see a single familiar face among his friends.

As for the eldest son, Liu Qingfeng, who had "sacrificed family for righteousness," he had long been removed from the Liu family tree. Now, he held a low-ranking position overseeing the transportation of goods, and while he was technically promoted from county magistrate, no one believed he could rise to a prominent position in the esteemed Qingluan Kingdom. It was likely that one day he would lose even his official title, and no one would care to discuss him—he was just another dull joke.

Moreover, the Kingdom of Qingluan was flourishing, its national fortune invigorated.

In the temples, on the mountains, within the martial world, and among scholars, talent was emerging like bamboo shoots after the rain—a magnificent display.

For instance, a six-year-old child had quickly gained fame as a prodigy within a year. During this year's Mid-Autumn Festival, the young prodigy was summoned to the capital by the emperor and empress. The doting empress, upon seeing the child, affectionately held him on her lap, while the emperor personally tested the child's poetry, asking him to compose a poem on the spot. The child, cradled in the empress's embrace, pondered briefly before effortlessly reciting a verse. The emperor was delighted and awarded the child the title of "Da Zhou Zheng" (Official Candidate), which, while not a formal government position, signified an official status. This meant that the child was likely to be the youngest civil official in the history of both the Kingdom of Qingluan and the entire Baoping Continent!

At this moment, as winter approached, atop a bumpy cart along the bank of an incompletely dredged river, the young man in white sat cross-legged, while the child held a kite made from a Qingluan specialty known as a "Muyu" (Wood Kite).

As long as the string remained unbroken, all kites in the world were destined to fly high, yet could not venture far.

Cui Dongshan leaned back, gazing blankly at the kites in the sky.

How is my master doing now?

The reopening of the river transport was an extremely complicated matter, involving many aspects of the Kingdom of Qingluan. Thus, the court did not rush, and progress appeared slow.

The officials overseeing this matter were not of high rank—three in total. Two were low-ranking officials summoned to the capital from the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Works, and the third was a governor from a certain state along the river route. Since the court had not publicized this matter widely, there was little attention to it among the populace. The two court officials seemed more interested in theoretical matters, while the local governor was pragmatic. In reality, the opposite was true; the governor, who had initially thought this would just be a formality, found that the two officials from the capital were already well-prepared, with detailed procedures that bordered on tedious. Even he, an experienced local administrator, felt he had little to contribute, only needing to follow the established process.

In addition to the two officials from the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Works, there was another one—a fifth-rank assistant named Liu Qingfeng.

Governor Hong, who had a disdainful attitude toward this Liu Qingfeng, was quite contemptuous. It was already looked down upon in the martial world to sell friends for profit, and to sell one's father for gain in the officialdom was even more despicable. Governor Hong found it exhausting to discuss matters with such a person, feeling that he would need to change his official robes each day to rid himself of the unpleasantness. Just drinking a cup of tea felt uncomfortable.

For the past six months, Governor Hong had treated Liu Qingfeng with disdain. The two court officials seemed to understand Hong's feelings and deliberately ignored him. As for Liu Qingfeng, he likely pretended to be respectful due to his small official hat and his guilty conscience, seldom speaking unless prompted by the two court officials.

One day, near a section of the river, there was lively entertainment with bamboo horse jumping.

A scholar, who had traversed the old river route twice, sat on a low earthen wall with a teenager named Liu Suo, watching the lively scene of drums and gongs. The bamboo horses, woven from bamboo strips and wrapped in colorful cloth, were tied at the waist of the performers. According to local customs, specific colors were designated for different participants—red for the groom, yellow for the young men, green for the girls, white for the scholars, and black for the warriors, each with its own meaning.

The scholar had completely lost the appearance of an official; his skin was tanned and shiny, wearing rough hemp clothing, save for a sturdy but worn pair of deer-hide boots that were not typical for common villagers.

Not every village hosted bamboo horse performances; it depended on which village had the funds. The more money spent, the better the performance would be.

This village clearly had invested quite a bit, making their bamboo horse performance particularly spectacular.

Nearby the wall, there were many young men from other villages who had come to enjoy the show, pointing at the girls from the wealthy village and making crude remarks about which maiden would surely develop a fuller figure in the future. The atmosphere was filled with laughter and banter, with discussions over which girl was the most beautiful in the area, as everyone had their own opinions.

The scholar watched the girls they pointed out without hiding his gaze, making the young servant beside him feel somewhat helpless. "Master, why are you behaving so indiscreetly?"

The scholar smiled, "The essence of a woman lies in her complexion; it's the white ones that are hardest to find. Actually, size doesn't matter."

The servant replied helplessly, "If you say so, Master."

The scholar chuckled, "You're still young; you'll understand in the future. A woman's face is not the most important; a good figure is what truly matters."

The servant rolled his eyes, "Master, what does that have to do with me? I haven't read many books yet, and I still have to take the examinations to become an official like you."

The scholar nodded, "You're a seed of knowledge; you will surely become an official one day."

The servant's spirits lifted instantly. 

Whatever Master said was authoritative!

In the distance, cheers and applause erupted from the bamboo horse performance.

Yet around them, there were also many onlookers who were scrutinizing the performers with skepticism, and more than a few scoffed, their applause sparse.

The servant softly asked, "Master, since you are so knowledgeable about the origins of the bamboo horse performances, can you tell me if they really aren't performing well? I think they’re quite good."

Liu Qingfeng replied softly, "Of course, they are good. But since we aren't paying, why should we say so? In this world, good things always come at a cost."

The servant was puzzled, "What does that mean?"

Liu Qingfeng smiled faintly, saying no more, and patted the boy's head, "Don't overthink these things; you are in the prime of your studies."

The servant nodded, then recalled something and curiously asked, "Why has Master only been looking into the historical records of the Ministry of Revenue's taxation lately?"

The boy didn't yet understand that these were not records accessible to a mere official like his master, but documents secretly delivered to his desk.

Liu Qingfeng spoke quietly, "When reviewing history, it’s always written by later emperors about the affairs of previous dynasties, which inevitably distorts the truth. However, the matter of money—its inflow and outflow—remains untainted. So, when we read history, we must examine the biographies of those who had control over finances throughout the ages, as well as the processes by which they minted and distributed various coins. By centering on an individual and expanding from there, it will be easier to see the successes and failures of national policies."

The servant scratched his head.

Liu Qingfeng gazed at the distant commotion, smiling, "You need not hurry; whenever you wish to read, I have plenty here."

Seeing his master in a talkative mood today made the servant happy since the grueling inspections along the river had drained him, and at that time, his master had not been very chatty, merely taking notes while observing the indistinct mountains and waters.

Taking advantage of his master's willingness to converse, the servant asked, "Master, why is it that whenever you arrive at a place, you always take a moment to speak with the local scholars and teachers?"

Liu Qingfeng replied, "Where do the seeds of knowledge come from? After one’s parents, it is the teachers. How could this not be a matter of great importance for us scholars? Is it possible for learned individuals to just fall from the sky?"

The servant nodded, "That makes sense, Master."

Liu Qingfeng smiled slightly, "This is something you should start pondering now."

The servant replied eagerly, "Certainly!"

Suddenly, a group of young men came rushing over, pushing their way toward the prime viewing spot where Liu Qingfeng and the servant sat. One of them jumped onto the wall, shouting, "Get lost!"

The young servant's face flushed with anger.

However, Liu Qingfeng had already stood up without saying a word and silently jumped down from the low wall. The boy had no choice but to follow suit, moving to another vantage point to watch the bamboo horse performance, but from that distance, it was harder to see.

This left the boy feeling quite upset.

His master was great in every way, but his overly accommodating nature was a flaw.

"Not arguing with those who spread rumors means in the end, you become one of them."

Liu Qingfeng chuckled, "Do not contend with false gentlemen over fame; do not compete with true villains for profit; do not argue with stubborn individuals over reason; do not vie with commoners for bravery; do not compete with resentful scholars for talent. Do not offer kindness to foolish people."

This was about not contending.

Yet there was also an art to contention.

However, Liu Qingfeng felt it would be better to discuss this with the boy later.

The young scholar, not focusing on his studies and merely contemplating grand principles, would not find it beneficial.

He just needed to avoid making major mistakes.

The young Liu Suo mustered his courage, rebelling for the first time against his all-knowing master, "If we don't contend for anything, then won't we end up with nothing? That seems like a huge loss! How can living mean stepping back at every turn? I think that's not good!"

Liu Qingfeng smiled, "Think it over again."

Liu Suo shook his head, "I just can’t understand."

Liu Qingfeng withdrew his gaze and turned to the boy, teasing, "With such foolishness, how can you be my servant?"

Liu Suo laughed sheepishly.

Liu Qingfeng suddenly said, "Let's go."

Liu Suo followed his master as they departed.

Liu Qingfeng walked slowly, contemplating matters of both minor and major significance.

Young Liu Suo originally had more questions, but upon seeing his master's demeanor, he understood he should not disturb him.

Li Baozhen's actions were for Liu Qingfeng merely a matter of observation.

Li Baozhen's ambition could be said to be considerable, though not small.

As one of the key figures among the spies of the Southern Green Wave Pavilion of the Great Li, he was attempting a careful strategy from the ground up, manipulating the chess pieces of scholars, martial heroes, and officials from the moment he entered the Kingdom of Qingluan. All were now effectively his pawns, and most were still young and ignorant, like the prodigious child awarded the title "Da Zhou Zheng."

At first glance, this might seem improper and reek of conspiracy, appearing ominous and threatening. However, it was not entirely so.

Li Baozhen was building a structure, with his first objective not to become the hidden emperor of the Kingdom of Qingluan, but to one day control the fates of even the immortals on the mountains through the secular dynasty. The reasoning was simple: even the seeds of cultivation had been sent to the mountains by Li Baozhen and the Great Li court. Year after year, as those seeds matured into founding ancestors or pillars of various sects, it would become quite easy to discuss the rules of the mortal world.

During this time, the great general of the Kingdom of Qingluan, Wei Liang, observed coldly from the sidelines, occasionally establishing rules that even Li Baozhen himself had to abide by.

Liu Qingfeng saw through Li Baozhen’s plans—from his intentions to his methods, he understood them clearly. To speak bluntly, either they were ideas Liu Qingfeng had discarded, or he had purposely left them for Li Baozhen.

For example, since the beginning of this year, several notable literary figures in the Kingdom of Qingluan had fallen from grace.

How to proceed? It was still the three tactics Liu Qingfeng had taught Li Baozhen back in the day: first, to praise them, declaring their poems and writings to be as commendable as those of the sages, lifting their personal integrity to the level of moral saints.

Then, someone would voice an opinion of moderation, quietly building momentum to lead public opinion in the literary sphere, causing neutral parties to grow increasingly weary of these so-called moral saints, whom they themselves found absurd.

Finally, it became simpler: "Aren't you flawless moral saints?" Then, using casually spoken words, they would fabricate accusations of personal faults against these figures. At this point, it would be the turn of the martial world and the marketplace to act. Traveling storytellers and booksellers would take turns stepping up, not to mention Li Baozhen’s carefully cultivated group of “imperial” writers, who would start expressing their indignation and taking up the righteous cause. In the end, one by one, they would be ruined, and the public, who had unknowingly stoked the flames, would hardly care for the truth. There might be a few who did, but they would be few and far between; most were just there for the spectacle. Just like Liu Qingfeng today, watching the lively bamboo horse performance from a distance.

Why expect those who already sought entertainment from a spectacle to think deeply?

Liu Qingfeng would not.

Moreover, there has never been a lively event that did not come to an end.

After the clamor, only silence remained.

This had always been the case.

Liu Qingfeng smiled to himself, "I’ve made a good start."

Furthermore, Li Baozhen was clever and easily drew inferences from one example to another.

Liu Qingfeng suddenly halted and said to the boy beside him, "Liu Suo, remember this: if one day someone tries to persuade you to harm me, whether as a long-term hidden pawn or in a rushed assassination, you must nod in agreement. Not only that, you must give it your all without hesitation or mercy."

The young servant's face turned pale.

His mind went blank.

He couldn’t understand why his master would say such frightening things.

Liu Qingfeng maintained his usual demeanor, speaking softly, "Because you will definitely fail. Keeping you by my side is, in fact, a way to harm you, so I must save you once. I don't want you to die in vain because of some so-called principles. During this time, how much you learn from me, how many connections you accumulate, and where you ultimately end up are all up to your own abilities. As for why I would keep you around knowing this, it is because I want to see if you can become a second Li Baozhen, only smarter—smart enough to genuinely benefit the world."

The young servant's face was drenched in tears, frightened by the unfamiliar nature of his master.

Liu Qingfeng gently asked, "Do you remember?"

The boy wiped his tears and nodded.

Liu Qingfeng smiled, "Very good. Now, from this moment on, you should try to forget all of this. Otherwise, you won't be able to deceive Li Baozhen."

Moments later, Liu Qingfeng was surprisingly astonished.

A young man in white was approaching him, but the personal guard sent from the Great Li had not shown himself at all.

That young man held a kite in his hand, his smile bright, "Liu Qingfeng, I'm here to dig my own foundation with a little shovel. You’ve been mingling with that old bastard, and it leads nowhere. Come follow me, Cui Dongshan. Besides, what is mine is mine, and his is still mine—no need to be polite. In the entire southern part of Baoping, I am the biggest; that old bastard has no authority over me!"

Liu Qingfeng laughed, "That seems a bit difficult."

Given the young man's hidden identity, Liu Qingfeng could access all the intelligence of the Green Wave Pavilion, allowing him to guess some things. Even if it was just a superficial identity, it was still sufficient for the young man to boldly spout such rebellious words.

Cui Dongshan tossed the kite he held to Liu Qingfeng, who caught it and looked down to find there was no string attached, prompting laughter.

Liu Qingfeng raised his head, shaking his head, "You should know that my aspirations do not lie here. The pursuit of self-preservation and material freedom has never been the goal of scholars like us."

Cui Dongshan strode forward, tilting his head and extending his hand, "Then give it back to me."

Liu Qingfeng smiled, "Of course, if someone gives it to me for free, that’s even better. I’ll keep it without returning it."

Cui Dongshan grinned, "Liu Qingfeng, if you keep satisfying my tastes like this, I might just have to help my master take disciples!"

Liu Qingfeng inquired with a smile, "I wonder who your master is?"

Cui Dongshan stood still, his feet unmoving, shoulders bobbing playfully as he mischievously grinned, "You've already met him."

Liu Qingfeng pondered for a moment, "I can’t guess."

Cui Dongshan burst into laughter, "To show my sincerity, I won’t keep you in suspense. My master is the very person who caused your cart to fall into the water back then."

Liu Qingfeng froze for a moment before tentatively asking, "Chen Pingan?"

Cui Dongshan was momentarily stunned, then in an instant, he jumped in front of Liu Qingfeng, lightly slapping the latter on the head with a loud smack, nearly causing Liu Qingfeng to stumble, as he angrily scolded, "You little brat dare to call out my master's name directly?!"

*End of Chapter*

 ### Chapter 634: The Land of One Continent Awakens to Sword

Two Daoists, one old and one young, were bound by local customs to travel on foot. The elder Daoist was no exception as he walked alongside his disciple by the banks of the Great River. The young Daoist, Zhang Shanfeng, was wide-eyed with wonder.

The Chen family of Yingyin truly deserved their reputation as the singular embodiment of "scholarly elegance." They were indeed the pinnacle of scholarly families in the realm. It wasn’t that they couldn’t hire a carriage to reach the Chen family shrine; rather, they were financially constrained. Even if Zhang Shanfeng consented, his pockets didn’t allow for it.

Fortunately, Zhang Shanfeng was used to traversing the rivers and mountains, and though he felt guilty for making his master endure hardship, it was clear that his master’s cultivation might not be high, but he had long since attained the practice of fasting, making the hundreds of miles not too difficult to travel. Still, a disciple should show filial piety, right? Each time he turned back, he found his master walking along, dozing like a chick pecking at rice, which made Zhang Shanfeng admire him. His master could sleep even while walking.

As they passed a blue stone cliff by the riverbank, Zhang Shanfeng spotted a young scholar in a Confucian robe, sitting with his back turned to them, lost in thought.

The Fire Dragon True Man opened his eyes and smiled, saying, “Ah, another who loves to sleep. Surely he will amount to something great.”

Zhang Shanfeng replied with a hint of grievance, “Master, when I first ascended the mountain, I was young and loved to sleep. Why didn’t you say the same about me? Why does my senior brother always use a chicken feather as a command to get me up for practice? Senior Brother Xiangzhi always claims he has the same talent as I do, saying it would be a great pity if I were to slack off in my cultivation. So even if you didn’t care, he couldn’t just let me waste my chance at cultivation on the mountain. In the end, I found out that Senior Brother Xiangzhi was actually only at the cave dwelling level. Whenever he spoke, he always carried such an air of authority, making me think he was a true Golden Core Earth Immortal. So, when he passed away, I cried terribly—not just because I couldn’t bear to part with Senior Brother Xiangzhi, but because I was somewhat disappointed in myself, feeling I was both foolish and lazy, destined to never reach the cave dwelling level in this life.”

The Fire Dragon True Man chuckled, “How could the teachings of a master turn into chicken feathers? Besides, what makes the cave dwelling level so low?”

Outside of Padi Peak, under the Fire Dragon True Man were the four main branches: Taixia, Taoshan, Baiyun, and Zhixuan. Even though the Fire Dragon True Man never set strict rules for the mountain, allowing any disciple to roam freely, the great cultivators of Taixia, including Lady Li Yu, forbade disciples from disturbing the True Man's sleep at Padi Peak. The disciples of Padi Peak were notorious for being reclusive and, indeed, their cultivation levels were not high.

Thus, disciples from the other branches, regardless of their seniority, primarily remembered their elders at Padi Peak as merely high-ranked with low skill levels.

During this time, Zhang Shanfeng had been the most deceived among the disciples of Padi Peak. Perhaps in the eyes of the great cultivators like Lady Li Yu, this little junior brother was as oblivious as one could be under the lamp, but seeing how well his master got along with him, they didn’t dare to intervene.

What’s more, back when Zhang Shanfeng boldly declared he would descend the mountain to slay demons and remove evil, his master, the Fire Dragon True Man, had played a trick on him, suggesting that since he was going down for experience, he might as well go far because there were no demons plaguing Padi Peak.

As a result, when Zhang Shanfeng left, he not only distanced himself from Padi Peak but eventually traveled far away to Baoping Continent. At that time, while Lady Li Yu was in seclusion, the founding ancestors of Taoshan, Baiyun, and Zhixuan grew somewhat anxious, fearing that their junior brother might stray too far from their mountain, leading to unforeseen accidents. Especially for the ancestor of Zhixuan Peak, whose combat strength could match that of an Earth Immortal, they hoped the master would permit him to leave Beijulu Continent to secretly protect Zhang Shanfeng. However, the Fire Dragon True Man did not agree, stating, "Cultivators should focus on their own practice; having someone guard them leads to nothing."

The founding ancestors felt somewhat uneasy but had always obeyed the master's words as law and did not dare to defy him. However, the ancestor of Baiyun, along with the other two masters, privately discussed the matter and believed that their master was not attentive enough toward the junior brother. Thus, they felt it was their responsibility to protect the path. The old Daoist then concocted a plausible excuse and went down the mountain to quietly escort Zhang Shanfeng for a while.

Hence, the dangers Zhang Shanfeng faced while slaying demons and the frustrations that followed were well known to the ancestor of Baiyun, and it implied that the other two ancestors understood as well. Especially when the ancestor of Zhixuan learned that Zhang Shanfeng had boarded the ferry to Daijiao Mountain with a heavy heart, the ancestor of Taoshan calculated and was shocked. He couldn’t help but decide that even if the master forbade him from following, he would let the Zhixuan Peak junior brother carry a sword down the mountain to protect his little junior brother. But unexpectedly, the Fire Dragon True Man suddenly appeared and stopped them. When the Zhixuan ancestor tried to argue, he was pushed back into his secluded cave by the master's hand. When the Fire Dragon True Man turned and smiled at the direct disciple of the Taoshan branch, the latter immediately said there was no need to trouble the master and returned to the mountain to enter seclusion.

Later on, the Baiyun ancestor received a message from the ancestor of Padi Peak via flying sword and promptly returned to Padi Peak, inevitably receiving a scolding.

However, when he left Padi Peak, he wore a joyous expression, while the two junior brothers of Taoshan and Zhixuan learned that their master had scolded their senior brother and then rewarded him with a date to eat.

In the end, everything was within the master’s calculations; it was merely a matter of who had the courage to care more for the little junior brother and dared to take the risk of being held accountable by the master, resolutely descending the mountain to escort him. Both were high-level individuals and quickly understood everything, leading the Zhixuan ancestor to chase after the Baiyun branch's senior brother, wanting to spar. Unfortunately, their senior brother escaped quickly, leaving no chance for his junior brother to vent his frustration.

Upon reaching the blue stone cliff by the river, they were already nearing the Chen family. A distance of several dozen miles wasn’t too long for cultivators. Even without riding the wind, they were only a few steps away in spirit.

Zhang Shanfeng spoke up, “Master, although we were invited this time, we still need to observe the proper etiquette when visiting. Let's not emulate that time at the Middle Land’s Shenze, where we just stomped our feet to greet the host without waiting for them to come out to meet us.”

The Fire Dragon True Man nodded with a smile, “Alright.”

Zhang Shanfeng asked with concern, “Will the books we bought from the bookstore truly not offend the scholars?”

The Fire Dragon True Man shook his head, “Giving books to scholars is the greatest courtesy in the world.”

Zhang Shanfeng felt somewhat reassured.

In truth, the young Daoist still had no idea who they were about to meet.

Zhang Shanfeng recalled something, “Master, as cultivators, we embrace the mountains and waters, cleansing our hearts with spiritual energy and distancing ourselves from the mundane. We do not visit kings or bow to emperors. But how do Confucian disciples cultivate? Is it truly solely through studying? If studying alone could lead to enlightenment, wouldn’t that mean everyone in the world could cultivate? If someone were to secretly transport the vast teachings of the world to other realms, especially to that wild land, wouldn’t it lead to disaster, with an influx of demon cultivators? What would happen then?”

The Fire Dragon True Man chuckled, “That is indeed an excellent question. However, it is not something an old Daoist like me should answer, or else it would truly be lacking in decorum, right?”

Zhang Shanfeng suddenly felt a refreshing breeze and turned to see an old scholar in a green robe approaching, smiling and nodding, “Before answering your question, I’d like to know what books you’ve brought for me?”

The Fire Dragon True Man patted his disciple’s shoulder, “Shanfeng, do you see? Someone is asking you for a gift.”

Zhang Shanfeng quickly bowed and addressed the old man as “Mr. Chen,” then unwrapped his bundle and took out three books.

The old man received them and glanced at them with some reluctance. After thanking the young Daoist, he tucked them into his sleeve.

Chen Chunan was regarded by the world as the foremost disciple of the Sub-Sage lineage.

Ironically, this outsider, the Great Celestial Master from Longhu Mountain, had gifted him three books that were supposed to be banned and destroyed by the Confucian School.

After accepting the books, Chen Chunan said, “Confucian disciples actually follow a cultivation path quite similar to that of Daoists, just with the added nurturing of the righteous qi within the heart. You embrace the mountains and waters, distancing yourselves from the world to create a pure realm free from the dust of both self and others. As for us scholars, we merely ‘read behind closed doors as if in a deep mountain.’ Regarding the places of cultivation and methods, they are akin to study rooms and the writings of sages, along with the principles contained within the texts. However, there are certainly thresholds; not everyone can cultivate simply by reading. For instance, the foundational breath control methods must be taught by virtuous gentlemen to the Confucian students. As for the innate roots of cultivation, that is another threshold. Therefore, many eloquent literati and seasoned scholars still cannot extend their lives simply by reading.”

Zhang Shanfeng found this explanation quite profound but still bowed and said, “Thank you, sir, for the clarification.”

Chen Chunan smiled, “There’s no need for excessive decorum. Scholars study, and cultivators cultivate; we are all kindred spirits. The essence of etiquette lies in its simplicity, not in its complexity.”

In truth, Chen Chunan was well aware of Zhang Shanfeng’s last question but deliberately chose not to reveal the answer.

Contrary to what the young Daoist thought, Confucianism never prohibited the existence of sentient beings in the world from studying and cultivating.

This was a rule set forth by the Sage of Rites.

Zhang Shanfeng turned to look at his master.

The Fire Dragon True Man chuckled, “What’s wrong? Just because you happened to encounter an imagined transcendent figure, you’re now finding fault with your own master for lacking a celestial demeanor?”

Zhang Shanfeng blinked, somewhat taken aback. This was something his master had said himself; he hadn’t thought that way.

The Fire Dragon True Man pointed to the not-so-far-off blue stone cliff, “Is that the kid who practices swordplay in his dreams?”

Chen Chunan nodded, “It’s a pity I’ll have to return it to Baoping Continent later. I’m somewhat reluctant. Over the years, I’ve often chatted with him here, and it seems I won’t have the chance anymore.”

The Fire Dragon True Man said to Zhang Shanfeng, “That person is the best friend of Chen Ping’an. Aren’t you going to say hello?”

Zhang Shanfeng was momentarily stunned, then bid farewell to his master and the old gentleman before rushing over.

The Fire Dragon True Man and Chen Chunan didn’t head toward the Chen family shrine but instead strolled leisurely along the riverside. The old master said, “At least you’re here on Nanposao Continent. What about the other southeastern Tongye Continent and southwestern Fuyiao Continent?”

Chen Chunan remained silent for a long time.

It was a somewhat strange question.

If the demon race from the wild land truly broke through the Sword Qi Great Wall, flooding like a tide and submerging the greatest mountain seal in the world, the Upside Down Mountain…

Then could Chen Chunan defend the Nanposao Continent, which was closest to Upside Down Mountain? It was uncertain. What relation did he have with Tongye and Fuyiao Continent?

Chen Chunan smiled, “The old scholar once advised me, which amounted to two choices: either don’t die or die early, so as not to die at an inopportune moment.”

The Fire Dragon True Man lamented, “The former Sage views the hearts of men, and there are none like it in the world.”

Although the Fire Dragon True Man was much older than that old scholar, he still sincerely regarded him as a senior.

Chen Chunan nodded.

He didn’t refute.

Even though he was the backbone of the Sub-Sage lineage, his own understanding was fundamentally at odds with that advocated by the old scholar.

In the world of Haoran, the contention of the sages regarding the direction of the Dao ultimately hinges on who’s great path better protects the common people and benefits society.

The contention of gentlemen is about clear distinctions of right and wrong, striving to establish a definite truth.

The contention of wise men merely concerns the temporary merits and flaws of their own knowledge, disputing on paper.

The intricate rules of Confucianism serve as the greatest protector of the realm of Haoran.

Yet the confinement of each Confucian Sage is the most binding action in the world.

That individual in the southern end of Baoping Continent, who was personally punished heavily by the Sub-Sage and regarded by the myriad cultivators as one of the seventy-two sacrificed sages who lost their chance to enjoy cold pig head meat, had also, in the matter of knowledge, led the Confucian disciples of different sects and academies across the continents to great benefits, thus enabling the wise to rise to the ranks of gentlemen. Despite his deep-seated animosity towards the old scholar, who was not a disciple of his, the old scholar still acknowledged the excellence of that individual’s knowledge, seeing the potential merits of it for the current world.

Time passes endlessly, indifferent to night and day, as it has since ancient times.

Two long-separated elders discussed the greatest matters in the world.

Meanwhile, two young men on the blue stone cliff found a common language, talking about trivial matters.

The young scholar dozing at the cliff was Liu Xianyang, who had been brought to Posa Continent from Baoping Continent by Chen Ping’an.

Upon learning that the young Daoist named Zhang Shanfeng was a close friend of Chen Ping’an, Liu Xianyang became quite happy and began to inquire about the sights and experiences from their travels.

Liu Xianyang knew some insider information about Baoping Continent, the Great Li Iron Cavalry, and the Li Zhu Cave Heaven, but not much, as he could only glean bits and pieces from the Mountain Water Gazette. He had no one to rely on while studying away from home, needing to be frugal. In the Yingyin Chen family, all books, no matter how rare or expensive, could be freely browsed by students, but the Mountain Water Gazette required payment. Fortunately, Liu Xianyang had made friends with a few disciples of the Chen family and scholars from the academy, allowing him to learn about affairs from other continents through them.

Compared to the tall, bright young man from the small town of years past, Liu Xianyang had become increasingly composed and introspective, diligent in his studies and rigorous in his academic pursuits, quietly cultivating without any laxity, increasingly aligning with the scholarly family tradition of the Chen family and the landscapes around him.

Conversely, the boy from Mud Bottle Alley, Liu Xianyang's best friend, was in pursuit of his own freedom of mind, having achieved what he sought.

Zhang Shanfeng poured out his admiration for Chen Ping’an.

For the young Daoist of Padi Peak, even if he found out he had missed the Great Celestial Master from Longhu Mountain, he might feel some regret, but he wouldn’t be too heartbroken. More so, he’d just think his master was foolish. Did he, Zhang Shanfeng, really dare to reach for the Great Celestial Master’s title? He wouldn’t even dare to think about it.

Even upon learning of that inexplicable loss, Zhang Shanfeng wouldn’t be too disturbed.

This might just be one of Zhang Shanfeng’s most unrecognized virtues.

Even more so than his belief that his master’s Daoist skills were mediocre at best.

However, when Zhang Shanfeng spoke of his parting with Chen Ping’an, he genuinely felt a pang of sadness.

Zhang Shanfeng took the ancient sword he had been carrying on his back and handed it to Liu Xianyang, a newfound friend, with a bright smile, “This is the sword that Chen Ping’an bought at Qingfu Workshop, called ‘Zhenwu.’ The previous armor charm that could transform into a rain of sweet dew was also on credit; I owe Chen Ping’an quite a bit. But now my master has helped me obtain two vials of water elixirs from the Shenze side. In the future, whenever I get the chance, I can give them to Chen Ping’an as repayment of my debt.”

Liu Xianyang slowly unsheathed the sword, noticing its fine cracks and rust. 

He flicked the blade with his fingers, producing a soft, resonant sound, nodding, “It’s very heavy.”

Zhang Shanfeng was puzzled, “This sword isn’t that heavy, is it?”

Liu Xianyang squinted, observing the subtle ripples along the blade, sensing the underlying mysteries within it. This had nothing to do with Liu Xianyang’s cultivation level; in fact, he had experienced numerous absurd battlefields in his dreams, witnessing countless fine swords—many were easily unsheathed, while others he couldn’t lift even if they were broken. However, Liu Xianyang had grown accustomed to remembering the names of those swords, their scabbard designs, and the patterns of sword energy they emitted, carefully feeling the differences in sword intent of each.

The more mysterious aspect was that he, who could disregard the passage of time in dreams, often found himself facing the swords of ancient masters, leaving him breathless and forcing him to withdraw from the dream in a cold sweat. In worse cases, he would vomit blood and suffer dizziness for days afterward.

Thus, when it came to swords, Liu Xianyang had already become quite an expert.

Not to mention his level of cultivation, just his broad horizons alone might surpass many sword immortals from Beijulu.

Liu Xianyang gently returned the sword to its sheath.

This sword, he had never seen in his dreams.

Yet the feeling seemed familiar, as if he had clearly sensed it on the greatest battlefield ruins, making him feel as if the world was a bit heavier.

As for whether this sword was indeed that one, it was hard to say; perhaps it was a finely crafted imitation, carrying a hint of “sword intent.”

Zhang Shanfeng re-secured the Zhenwu ancient sword on his back and turned to find the tall young man seemingly lost in thought.

Zhang Shanfeng was somewhat puzzled as to why Liu Xianyang, upon hearing that his best friend from his hometown had achieved so much, still appeared more melancholic than joyful. 

Liu Xianyang, with his fists pressed against his knees, gazed into the distance and murmured, “You’ve known Chen Ping’an longer than I have, so you might not know that his greatest hope in this life is simply to be safe and sound. He’s the most timid person, scared of illness and disaster. Yet, in the early days, he was the least afraid of ghosts in the world. Isn’t that strange? Back then, it seemed he felt that as long as he was living earnestly, if he were to die, he would have no regrets, thinking that perhaps he would reunite with people in another place.”

Liu Xianyang continued softly, “So the Chen Ping’an you know has become so cautious because he must have found an absolute reason for not wanting to die. Would you think there’s anything wrong with such a change? I think it’s good, but I understand it will be burdensome for him. When we met, aside from me, no one knew how much he had done for the mother and child from Mud Bottle Alley who had shown him kindness, how much effort he put in, and how much grievance he bore.”

Liu Xianyang smiled, “I’ve only seen him cry twice in my life. The last time was when I was close to dying. The first time was long ago when we were both apprentices at the dragon kiln, and I heard some gossip from Xinghua Alley, accusing the woman from Mud Bottle Alley of having an unclear relationship with him. I got out of bed in the middle of the night and didn’t see him, so I went outside and found him sitting on a stool by the door, tears streaming down his face.”

“I squatted beside him and learned what had happened. My heart became heavy. I had always been carefree about the trivial matters of the marketplace, initially treating it as a joke, so I laughed and asked him if there was any truth to the rumors. He was already so heartbroken that he ignored me. So I knew at that moment he was truly hurt. I refrained from making light of the situation. I couldn’t comfort him, so I could only stay with him. In the end, he came to terms with it, telling me that the favor from Gu Can’s family would take a lifetime to repay. In the future, he would have to be even more diligent in helping them, not letting others gossip and speak ill, nor could he only care for his own feelings, ignoring everything, because in the end, the ones who would suffer the most would be Gu Can and his mother.”

Liu Xianyang leaned back, resting his head on his hands, “Actually, I wanted to tell him back then, could it be possible that Gu Can’s mother didn’t care about those idle words, and it was just him, Chen Ping’an, overthinking? But in the end, I never said those words because I couldn’t bear to. I was afraid that if I spoke, he would become enlightened, and our bond would change. These were my selfish thoughts because I knew that if he treated Gu Can poorly today, he would naturally treat me less well tomorrow. But now that I’ve traveled across a continent to here, after so many years, I regret not letting Chen Ping’an be who he truly is. Why should he live his life for others? Why should he?”

As dusk fell over the riverside stone cliff, a gentle breeze caressed them.

Tonight, the same bright moon would hang in the sky.

Zhang Shanfeng fell silent for a long time before softly asking, “When will you return home to take a look?”

Liu Xianyang lay there, closing his eyes, “I’ll strive to return as soon as possible, maybe within ten years at the shortest.”

Zhang Shanfeng sighed, “It should be sooner. The books say that wealth and honor do not return to one’s hometown, like wearing brocade at night. For us cultivators, it’s quite difficult. On the mountain, we lose track of the seasons. It seems like just a blink, and when we return home, what will be left? Who can we boast to? Even if the family still exists, with descendants, what more can we say?”

Liu Xianyang replied, “I don’t have much attachment to my hometown. I’m not going back to prove anything to anyone. So when I return to Baoping Continent, the first place I want to go isn’t that small town, nor the first person I want to see, not even Chen Ping’an.”

Zhang Shanfeng turned to look, “Is there a knot in your heart?”

Liu Xianyang kept his eyes closed, smiling, “The only way to untie a dead knot is through death.”

Suddenly, Liu Xianyang sat up, “When I reach Baoping Continent, I’ll choose a Mid-Autumn Reunion Night to ask the Sword at Zhengyang Mountain in my dreams!”

Zhang Shanfeng softly asked, “Aren’t you waiting for Chen Ping’an?”

Liu Xianyang crossed his arms and laughed, “Don’t forget, it’s always been me, Liu Xianyang, taking care of Chen Ping’an!”

Yet Liu Xianyang didn’t forget.

In truth, from the first day they met, it was Chen Ping’an who had saved Liu Xianyang from that Mud Bottle Alley.

Zhang Shanfeng didn’t think Liu Xianyang was speaking grandly.

After all, Chen Ping’an had often mentioned that there was someone named Liu Xianyang who had taken care of him a lot and taught him many things.

However, the two best friends hadn’t spoken a word about their encounters and partings in their youth.

Suddenly, Liu Xianyang turned his gaze northeast.

Something stirred in his heart.

Liu Xianyang suddenly said, “I need to sleep for a while.”

Zhang Shanfeng felt somewhat helpless; he was quite like his master.

In the distance, an old scholar in a Confucian robe and an old Daoist in a Daoist robe both sighed at the same time.

Especially the Fire Dragon True Man, who felt a deep sense of sorrow.

For the friend who had visited Padi Peak before embarking on the long journey to Upside Down Mountain had been the first sword immortal from Beijulu Continent to die in battle south of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Now that Beijulu had received the news, this was the commotion that ensued.

This was an ancient tradition passed down through generations in Beijulu.

To hold a sword memorial.

The sword energy soared to the heavens.

The world would know.

On a small hill in the Fuhua Kingdom, Chen Ping’an quietly stayed for three days, both practicing his fist techniques and cultivating.

Regarding the breathing methods of cultivators, Chen Ping’an had never been so focused and dedicated. Sitting cross-legged, he was able to forget himself entirely.

When the time came, the array set by Liu Jinglong that could withstand three attacks from the Nascent Soul dissipated on its own.

This commotion finally caused Chen Ping’an to open his eyes.

Previously, Chen Ping’an had already taken off his black Daoist robe and changed into a plain green robe. He slung a bamboo box over his back and took out a simple green bamboo walking staff, heading down the mountain.

Once more, he resembled a scholarly traveler.

The serene cultivation of a fifth realm cultivator, besides refining the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into their own small world, also strengthened their bones, unlike ordinary people. Upon reaching the cave dwelling realm, their bones became strong and solid, appearing like jade. When the power reached them, it manifested.

Upon reaching the Golden Core realm, further along, as bones and meridians melded, they exhibited the “golden branches and jade leaves” phenomenon, with clouds and mist swirling around their energy chambers, lingering for long periods. Especially upon reaching the Nascent Soul realm, they would open small worlds within their bodies at critical acupoints, refining the condensed essence of heaven and earth into a small Nascent Soul that resonated with their own great path. This was the foundation of the outer body of the Yang God of fifth realm cultivators, though it was similar to that of the Golden Core, each having its own hierarchy.

This was the innate nature and potential of a Qi practitioner.

The so-called innate nature of a cultivator refers to the size of their small world, which can carry spiritual energy.

As for potential, it determines whether a Qi practitioner can reach the Earth Immortal level and the quality of their Golden Core and Nascent Soul after embarking on the cultivation path. The speed of a Qi practitioner’s cultivation may vary drastically.

As for temperament, it pertains to cultivating the heart, being the most ethereal and elusive, yet often failing at critical moments, leading to unforeseen incidents. For example, the determined Liu Laocheng from Gongliu Island could have perished early due to a momentary lapse caused by a heart demon born from love. Lu Fang from Ouhua blessed land, too, was troubled by love, and for a century, Jiang Shangzhen, who had taken the name Zhou Fei, still couldn’t fully open his heart.

In contrast, Jiang Shangzhen, who seemed to have been marred by more romantic entanglements, was not troubled by such heart demons at all.

This was all due to the differences in temperament.

As for opportunities, they were difficult to seek, appearing to rely solely on fate.

Previously, He Xiaoliang from the Divine Revelation Sect, Huang Ting from Tongye Continent, and of course Li Huai, who was well acquainted with Chen Ping’an, all belonged to that kind of fortunate individuals.

Now, Chen Ping’an had successfully refined two of his life’s objects, the Water Character Seal from the Water House and the Five-Color Earth from Great Li, creating a splendid landscape of mountains and waters.

In terms of cultivation, progress accelerated significantly.

The extraction and refining of spiritual energy became quicker and more stable.

Thus, it could be said that as long as Chen Ping’an sought a serene and beautiful place rich in spiritual energy, even if he remained still on that small hill, just sitting there, day and night would be spent in cultivation, actually enhancing his cultivation and realm.

Therefore, it’s not hard to understand why the more talented cultivators are, the less likely they are to linger on the mountain, unless they encounter a bottleneck, they will descend the mountain for a while, engaging in quiet reflection and heart cultivation, avoiding wayward paths and walls without realizing it. Many insurmountable obstacles are incredibly profound; perhaps moving just a step may lead to a new world, or perhaps it requires traversing thousands of miles, accumulating profound insights in order to make a breakthrough, turning what was once an obstacle into a path.

For ordinary cultivators, the third realm is a moderately sized hurdle, referred to on the mountain as the “Retaining People’s Realm.”

However, this notion is utterly fallacious in properly inherited sects of immortal families.

This is why wild cultivators envy the disciples of the sects so much.

They might have to bleed and suffer before finding a path through the third realm's difficulties, whereas for the disciples of the great immortal families, it’s as simple as lifting a hand to observe hand lines; all paths are laid bare.

And Chen Ping’an's third realm is that of the wild cultivators.

Because regarding cultivation, it seems no one ever provided any specific guidance.

Initially, the Bridge of Longevity was broken and shattered, discussing this matter would be meaningless.

Later was the practice of swordplay and fist techniques, with a focused heart.

Previously, at the Luying Kingdom’s Dragon Head Ferry, the immortal guest known as the Kingfisher had detailed the key to the cultivation of the lower five realms. However, since both parties belonged to different sects and lineages, Qi Jinglong was bound by mountain rules and restrictions, making it impossible to explore Chen Ping’an’s various energy chambers, thus he couldn’t give precise guidance.

Nonetheless, Qi Jinglong’s advice remained invaluable.

Because it was destined to be correct.

It required Qi Jinglong to stand at an elevated position on the mountain to articulate it clearly.

Chen Ping’an naturally remembered this well.

He had just taken a sip from the jar of wine left by Liu Jinglong, savoring it slowly, intending to save at least half a jar.

Refining on the first and fifteenth days was still quite taxing.

Currently, his bodily injuries had not yet healed, so Chen Ping’an walked increasingly slowly and cautiously.

However, when he neared the border of Lujiu County, he became aware of something.

He simply continued to feign ignorance.

Dealing with such matters of being tailed, Chen Ping’an wouldn’t claim to be exceptionally skilled at it, but among his peers, he likely wouldn’t be too far from the mark.

Earlier, when Li Fuhua, a Nascent Soul cultivator from Shujian Lake, had secretly followed him, Chen Ping’an had sensed something was awry early on. Later, he had engaged in mutual calculations with Gao Cheng from Beijulu’s Jingguan City, leading to that second wave of assassins from Gela Mountain.

Moreover, the current stealthy assassin couldn’t be considered very powerful, and was merely self-assured in their concealment, but they displayed incredible patience, refraining from making a move despite several seemingly opportune moments.

Chen Ping’an allowed this assassin to “guard the path” for him.

Lujiu County was the hometown of the down-and-out scholar Lu Dun, whom Chen Ping’an had once encountered on the mountain.

However, Chen Ping’an had no intention of visiting his family because even if he had that thought, he might not find anyone.

One of the nearby scholars, surnamed Zhou instead of Lu, possibly out of a precautionary mindset, didn’t reveal his true surname to Chen Ping’an.

But Chen Ping’an believed this was the right approach.

True sincerity in meeting others is never just about exposing one’s heart through words.

Casual acquaintanceship can easily lead to self-deception.

If one cannot even be responsible for oneself, how can they be responsible for the world and others, and then genuinely offer goodwill?

However, while the principle stands, the world has its complexities, and being genuine everywhere is ultimately not too good.

Chen Ping’an detoured around the small town, unwilling to entangle himself further with the assassin.

Thus, on a secluded path, he suddenly vanished, appearing next to the assassin who was lying in the reeds. Chen Ping’an stood atop a reed, his figure swaying with the wind, quietly looking down to find a young boy dressed in black robes with a snow-white mask—definitely an assassin from Gela Mountain. Yet this was the most intriguing part; this young assassin from Gela Mountain had been trailing Chen Ping’an all this way, enduring considerable hardship. Either Qi Jinglong hadn’t found the right person, or reason had failed to communicate, leading to the involvement of high-level cultivators from Gela Mountain in the assassination attempt on him. Alternatively, it could mean that Qi Jinglong had thoroughly clarified the reasoning behind it, leading Gela Mountain to choose to abide by a larger rule: even if different employers were involved, if they attempted to assassinate the same person three times, they would no longer attack even if someone else came along offering mountains of gold and silver.

If that were the case, why hadn’t Qi Jinglong shown his face?

Chen Ping’an pondered and spoke, “Aren’t you in a hurry to find your employer?”

The Gela Mountain assassin moved stiffly, turning to look at the young man in green standing amidst the reeds.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to flee, but his intuition told him that escaping would mean death, while staying put offered a slim chance of survival.

He sat up, took off the mask, and said, “I made a pact with that Liu fellow: as soon as you discover my whereabouts, even if my assassination attempt fails, I’ll follow him in cultivation and call him master, so please don’t kill me.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “And where’s he?”

The boy shook his head, “He told me to inform you that he needs to make a trip to the Great Zhuang Capital first and will return to find us later.”

At this point, the boy slammed his fist into the ground, feeling frustrated, “This is my first time descending the mountain to assassinate someone!”

Chen Ping’an gracefully landed, stepping out of the reeds, using his walking staff to clear the path.

The boy hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth, discarding the mask and following behind the young man.

Chen Ping’an slowed his pace, and the boy glanced at him, stiffly keeping up, walking side by side.

Regarding this assassination target, there had been some rumors within Gela Mountain. As someone who was heavily cultivated and had grown up alongside the mountain lord, he had the chance to learn some insider information.

In general, despite looking amiable and scholarly, the mountain lord had once told the boy that the person standing next to him was someone who could get into trouble easily and excel at resolving issues.

Chen Ping’an asked, “Are you a sword cultivator?”

The boy nodded, “My master says I’m a valuable innate sword seed, so I must cherish my life and not rush to take on tasks. Otherwise, with all the resources he’s invested in me, he’d suffer a loss. So I’ve always wanted to take on work early to help my master and Gela Mountain earn money. I never expected to encounter someone like Liu. He claims I can simply stand still and let my master make his moves. Every time he attacks, I have to listen to him explain something, and my master ended up making two moves, then followed two of his words.”

Upon reaching this point, the boy looked utterly despondent.

In his memory, his master had never returned empty-handed after a sword strike.

Regardless of the opponent’s cultivation level, they had always ended up with their heads rolling.

The boy let out a long sigh, releasing the pent-up frustration that had been building inside him. “Our Gela Mountain always keeps its word. In the end, my master had no choice but to send me to assassinate you. From now on, I’ll have no connection with Gela Mountain, and I’ll have to go with that Liu fellow to some ridiculous Taohui Sword Sect.”

Chen Ping’an smiled as he extended his hand, opening his palm.

The boy frowned, “What are you doing?”

Chen Ping’an said, “You should thank me for allowing you to go to the Taohui Sword Sect for cultivation.”

“You must be joking!” The boy rolled his eyes, “Who wants to be a disciple of a pedigree immortal? I’m just lacking in ability. Those countless opportunities I’ve had don’t feel like opportunities. If it weren’t for that, I would have stabbed you to death long ago and felt utterly relieved!”

Chen Ping’an withdrew his hand, laughing, “Such a heavy killing intent should be directed towards Qi Jinglong instead.”

The boy turned his head and spat, “Even if that Liu fellow is better than our mountain lord, so what? Do I have to switch my allegiance? Besides, he looks like a bookworm; if I follow him, every day I’ll have to call out ‘master’ to this slowpoke. I’m afraid I won’t even become a sword immortal in this lifetime.”

Chen Ping’an said, “Have you thought about the possibility that your master actually hopes you can follow Qi Jinglong?”

The boy was silent for a moment, “I can guess. My master treats me well; I’ve always known that. So I plan to call that Liu fellow ‘master’ on the surface, but in my heart, I’ll only recognize my master as my one true master.”

The boy turned his head, worrying that the fellow might spread rumors about him when he reached Liu Jinglong’s side, which would cause him trouble in the future.

But for some reason, as he walked alongside this person, he felt the urge to speak more of his heart.

Perhaps the change was too immense, and he couldn’t hold it in anymore; it wasn’t hard for the boy to feel like he might suffocate.

Chen Ping’an smiled, “It’s good that you can think this way now, and it’s also correct. Changing your thoughts in the future doesn’t mean your current feelings were wrong.”

The boy furrowed his brow, “Who do you think you are to say such profound things? What? You think I can’t kill you, so you’re acting all high and mighty? You think you can just point fingers at me?!”

This temper of his...

Was truly not good.

Chen Ping’an remained unbothered, “Anyone can speak reason. I’m stronger than you and still willing to talk reason. Is that a bad thing? Do you want me to punch you to death, or beat you half to death, forcing you to kneel and beg me to impart reason? Would that be better?”

The boy felt a headache coming on, raising his hand, “Stop it! My mountain lord has been annoyed by that Liu fellow for half a day, and now I’ve been kicked out without even being allowed to say a word.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and twisted his wrist, producing two flasks of sweet rice wine, “Drink or not?”

The boy’s eyes lit up as he snatched one of the flasks, opened it, and took a hearty swig. Afterward, he grimaced, “So this is what wine tastes like? Not interesting at all.”

Chen Ping’an didn’t even glance back, just continued walking slowly, “Now that you’ve had a drink, you might as well finish it. It’s fine if you take your time. If you dare to toss it aside right now, I’ll teach you some lessons that you won’t want to hear.”

The boy wore a sarcastic expression, “See? In the end, you’re still resorting to force. Don’t think I’m saying this lightly; you’re not even as good as that Liu fellow!”

Chen Ping’an laughed, “While Qi Jinglong hasn’t returned yet, you should enjoy your wine. If all goes as planned, you might not get to drink for a long time in the future.”

The boy’s brows knitted together, “You know Liu warned me in advance not to drink if you offer it to me?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “I’m not a clairvoyant.”

The boy raised his arm and glanced at the wine flask in his hand. After hesitating a moment, he didn’t dare to toss it aside. He took another sip of the rice wine; in truth, it wasn’t bad, and he didn’t feel any burning sensation in his throat.

It seemed he was someone who could naturally drink.

No wonder he was an innate sword seed!

He suddenly asked tentatively, “How about you speak to Liu and tell him you’re willing to accept me as your disciple?”

Chen Ping’an didn’t respond.

The boy began to persuade this young man in green, saying he would definitely remember his kindness and would repay him in the future. When he returned to Gela Mountain, he would burn incense at the shrine, acknowledge his ancestors, and would not charge for helping him assassinate his enemies…

Chen Ping’an asked, “By the way, what’s your name?”

The boy wasn’t typically one to answer questions readily, but this matter of names was a source of personal pride, even more so than being an innate sword seed. He scoffed, “My master named me Bai Shou! Don’t worry, within a hundred years, there will be a sword immortal named Bai Shou in Beijulu!”

Chen Ping’an exclaimed, “Then you should be careful of your future title. Bai-Tou Sword Immortal or something, that doesn’t sound pleasant.”

The boy thought about it, and Chen Ping’an’s words made sense!

He nodded, “Thanks for the heads up!”

Chen Ping’an raised his wine flask, and the young sword cultivator named Bai Shou paused for a moment before realizing, raising his own flask to clink it against Chen Ping’an’s, then both took a drink.

Bai Shou wiped his mouth, feeling quite good; he believed he had a bit of heroic spirit and sword immortal demeanor now.

Chen Ping’an murmured with a smile, “You should listen to your master in other matters, but when it comes to drinking, a sword immortal should partake; it would be a pity otherwise.”

Bai Shou nodded vigorously, “Although you were quite annoying at first, I find you much more agreeable now. What’s your name?! You should know, I Bai Shou won’t remember many names in my lifetime. Do you see that Liu guy? Have I ever called him by his full name?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “My name is Chen Haoren.” 

Bai Shou angrily retorted, “You better know your place!”

Chen Ping’an turned to ask, “Are you going to hit me?”

Bai Shou rolled his eyes, “You think I’m an idiot?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Exactly. Go ahead and hit me.”

Bai Shou felt deeply humiliated, downing another gulp of wine.

This was practically the second humiliation since he had come down the mountain.

Chen Ping’an turned his head.

Dusty and weary, Qi Jinglong should have arrived long ago, having followed them for quite a while.

Qi Jinglong sighed helplessly, “Are you really addicted to persuading others to drink?”

Chen Ping’an laughed, “Every swordsman will likely remember those who encouraged them to drink.”

Qi Jinglong asked, “Who was it that encouraged you?”

Chen Ping’an said, “Originally, it was a swordsman, later an old gentleman.”

Despite Bai Shou’s constant mention of that Liu fellow, upon Qi Jinglong’s arrival, he immediately fell silent, as if standing next to Chen Ping’an while holding the unfinished wine flask. Even if he wouldn’t drink anymore, it felt wrong.

The land dragon of Beijulu, Liu Jinglong, had indeed remained stationary, allowing Bai Shou’s master, the mountain lord, to deliver two sword strikes!

What appeared to be a casually drawn talisman array, a place unseen by the flying swords of the small world, after two strikes from his master, had left him with no will to deliver a third.

Qi Jinglong said, “Before I set out, let’s find a secluded mountaintop. You will witness a rarely seen spectacle. Afterward, you will understand more about us Beijulu.”

Chen Ping’an nodded, naturally in agreement.

That night, the three of them reached the peak of a high mountain.

At the Great Zhuang Capital, by the banks of the Yuxi River.

Ji Yue stood on one side of the riverbank.

A green-robed old scholar stood on the opposite bank, smiling, “Just go ahead and hold the sword memorial.”

Ji Yue nodded, “I still trust your character, Gu You.”

That night in Beijulu.

From a great sword immortal who had journeyed to Upside Down Mountain in his early years, the sword cultivators of the mountain gate were the first to raise their flying swords, shooting into the heavens.

Like a bright white rainbow of sword energy arising from the earth.

Then came the first sword immortal of Beijulu, Bai Shang, whose dazzling sword light soared into the sky.

Moreover, all the sword cultivators of the Taohui Sword Sect, led by their sect leader, rode their flying swords, illuminating the night sky with their sword lights, casting brilliance over the entire sect’s territory, making the heavens shine bright as day.

Zhixuan Peak also had an ancestor who raised the peach wood sword, often used for slaying demons and removing evil.

Even as the battle of life and death with a tenth realm martial artist was about to commence, Ji Yue still first took to the skies with his sword, memorializing a fellow cultivator who had died far away.

At the Floating Duck Sword Lake, led by the sword immortal Li Cai, all sect sword cultivators drew their swords.

From the ancestor hall of the Mima Sect, aside from a few sword cultivators already raising their swords, the sect leader Zhu Quan pressed the hilt of his sword, allowing Pang Lanxi beside him to also ride her long sword into the sky to pay tribute.

On the Bone Marsh, the spirit of the hero Pu Rang also unsheathed his sword, with Gao Cheng breaking the heavens’ taboos with a punch, solely to allow Pu Rang’s sword to rise higher!

Even all the sword immortals, sects, and sword cultivators, who opposed the sword immortal who had died, without exception, raised their swords to memorialize.

Thus, one by one, beams of varying sword energies rose from the territory of Beijulu.

Under the night sky of Haoran, there were naturally many lights in the human realm.

But never had Beijulu seen so many sword immortals and sword cultivators raising their swords together, illuminating the entire continent like lights simultaneously.

On a nameless high peak within the Fuhua Kingdom, Qi Jinglong also began to raise his sword.

This time, he gave it his all. His life’s sword, named “Regulations,” shot up into the sky, its sword energy like a rainbow, creating a magnificent spectacle.

Qi Jinglong stood with his hands behind him, gazing at the delicate lines rising from the earth.

All were sword cultivators of the continent memorializing that fellow cultivator, while also honoring a shared great path among sword cultivators.

He suddenly turned his head to look at Chen Ping’an beside him, smiling, “Have you truly thought it through? If someone with ulterior motives sees it, revealing your hidden methods might bring you trouble in your future travels.”

Yet Qi Jinglong was already aware of the answer.

At some point, Chen Ping’an had already grasped a long sword.

The sword's name was Sword Immortal.

Chen Ping’an tilted his head slightly and softly said, “Thinking of so many things others would rather not think about is precisely for the sake of not having to ponder some matters.”

In that moment, the green-clad figure swayed atop the mountain, his sleeves fluttering loudly.

The boy named Bai Shou, who had already been dazzled by Qi Jinglong’s sword light, instinctively strained to open his eyes, not wanting to miss that scene.

When that person gently called out, “Let’s go,” a golden sword light appeared in the heavens, soaring sword energy shooting up to the sky.

Moreover, two streaks of white and green sword light flew out from that person’s acupoints, rushing into the sky.

When Qi Jinglong retracted his life’s sword, Chen Ping’an raised his sword sheath, the Sword Immortal descending from the heavens, the sound of metal ringing as it returned to its sheath.

Then, the traveler from Beijulu, this green-clad swordsman, gently slung it over his shoulder.

At that moment, the young sword cultivator named Bai Shou felt that receiving a jar of wine from that green-clad man was quite something to take pride in.

They parted ways.

Qi Jinglong rode the wind back north, while Bai Shou could also ride the wind to journey far.

Bai Shou turned to see that person standing in place, performing a gesture of raising his flask in salute. Bai Shou nodded vigorously, and both sides didn’t exchange words.

Unexpectedly, Qi Jinglong spoke, “As for drinking, don’t even think about it.”

Bai Shou, infuriated, retorted, “Liu, if you keep this up, I might just slip away and seek out your friend to make him my master!”

Qi Jinglong laughed, “You’re welcome to try; he’ll surely send you away.”

Bai Shou questioned, “Why would that be?”

Qi Jinglong smiled, “Because he’s stingy with wine money.”

Bai Shou scoffed, “You’re lying! How could he be that stingy?”

Qi Jinglong nodded, “He’s stingier than you could imagine.”

Bai Shou sighed, “I must have been blind, thinking I’d make him my master.”

Bai Shou suddenly asked, “So is it because you’re worried about delaying my sword practice or is it because you’re stingy with money that you don’t allow me to drink?”

Qi Jinglong said, “It’s both.”

Bai Shou angrily exclaimed, “You’re even worse than him!”

Qi Jinglong turned his head, smiling, “When did I ever say I was better than him?”

Bai Shou felt a surge of frustration, having held it in for so long, he finally couldn’t help but shout, “You and your friend are both like this! Damn it, have I fallen into a den of thieves?”

Qi Jinglong laughed, “That’s not quite the case.”

Bai Shou sighed again.

Times were truly tough.

On the other side of the mountain, the re-equipped Chen Ping’an began to descend slowly, thinking that Qi Jinglong and his newly accepted disciple were probably discussing his good traits, like being generous and magnanimous. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 635: On the Path of Cultivation**

As Chen Pingan descended from the mountain peak, he hesitated for a moment before donning the black robe known as the "Hundred-Eyed Glutton," which he had "picked up" from Yang Ningxing of the Chongxuan Bureau in the Dayuan Dynasty. The robe's golden embellishments were still too conspicuous. Previously, he had switched to a plain blue shirt out of caution, worried that traveling along this peculiar river that led to the ocean at both ends would attract unnecessary attention. However, after witnessing Qi Jinglong's sword offering at the mountain's summit, Chen Pingan reconsidered. Now that he had entered the realm of Liu Jin (the realm of staying), wearing a robe of decent quality would help him absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth more quickly, beneficial for his cultivation.

Lu Jiu County was one of the top counties in the Kingdom of Fuqu, known for its rich cultural atmosphere. Chen Pingan had bought several miscellaneous books at a bookstore in the county city, including a collection that had gathered dust for years—a compendium of agricultural edicts issued in early spring by the Kingdom of Fuqu. Some of the texts were eloquent, while others were simple in style. As he meticulously flipped through the collection, Chen Pingan discovered that those similar scenes he had observed in the Three Continent lands each spring were, in fact, part of a set routine: land prayers for good harvests, official tours, and encouragement for the people to engage in farming.

The beauty of reading and traveling lay in the serendipity of flipping through a book, as if the sages had helped future generations of readers string together a thread, linking the affairs and emotions of the world into a dazzling array of beads.

After taking a rough tour of the scenic spots in Lu Jiu County, Chen Pingan spent the night at a well-known inn in the city. Upon entering the county, he deliberately suppressed the robe's ability to absorb spiritual energy to avoid attracting attention from the City God's Pavilion or the Civil and Military Temples.

In fact, for every Qi practitioner, especially those who had reached the Middle Five Realms, traveling through the mountains and rivers of the mortal world was akin to a dragon swimming through the river, not an insignificant affair. Generally, once they descended from the mountains to continue their training and absorb the spiritual energy of various landscapes, it was a matter of adhering to the rules. As long as one did not show obvious signs of over-extraction—like fishing in a dried-up pond—the local deities would usually turn a blind eye.

Under the night sky, Chen Pingan lit a lamp on the table in his inn room and flipped through the compendium of agricultural edicts again. After closing the book, he began to enter a meditative state.

Not relying on the Hundred-Eyed Glutton robe to absorb the thin spiritual energy of the county city did not mean he was not cultivating. Absorbing spiritual energy was never the entirety of cultivation. Throughout his journey, within the small universe of his body, it resembled the crucial acupoints of the Water Palace and the Mountain Shrine. The accumulation and refinement of spiritual energy were fundamental to cultivation. The interconnectedness of his two life-bound items required him to cultivate a phenomenon akin to the interplay of mountain roots and water currents. In simple terms, Chen Pingan needed to refine the spiritual energy and solidify the foundations of his Water Palace and Mountain Shrine. However, the spiritual energy he had gathered was far from reaching a point of overflowing saturation. Thus, the urgent task was to find an unclaimed treasure land of feng shui. Unfortunately, this was not easy, so retreating to a place like the Dragon Head Ferry in the Green Oriole Nation to seclude himself for a few days was a viable alternative.

In fact, he could use the naturally rich spiritual energy of the Immortal Money to directly refine it into spiritual energy for his Qi Palace. However, at this moment, Chen Pingan had not even fully refined the existing spiritual energy, making such an act counterproductive. The lower the cultivation realm, the slower the absorption of spiritual energy, while the spiritual energy of Immortal Money was exceedingly pure and dissipated too quickly. This was akin to many precious talismans losing their effectiveness once "opened," resulting in a valuable talisman becoming worthless paper. Even if the Immortal Money could be crushed and refined for temporary storage by the robe, it would inadvertently conflict with the illusion spell applied to it, making him even more conspicuous.

Every cultivator was essentially the lord of their own small universe, relying on their skills to become their own sage. The key was the extent of control over their domain and the size of their territory. The path of cultivation was akin to a cavalry force expanding its territory on the battlefield.

Ultimately, the height of a realm and the efficacy of one's Dao were determined by how many residences one could establish. In the mortal world, there were countless types of buildings, each with its own hierarchy, and caves were no different. The best quality naturally belonged to blessed lands and paradises.

After steadying his breath and focusing his mind, Chen Pingan first arrived at the entrance of the Water Palace. With a thought, he could effortlessly pass through walls, as if the rules of heaven and earth did not bind him; he was the rule, and the rule was him.

However, he paused outside the door for a moment before two young attendants in green quickly opened the door, bowing respectfully to him with beaming faces. 

Inside the Water Palace, which now featured a suspended water character seal and a mural depicting water currents, the little green-robed boys, who finally had work to do, were evidently in high spirits and very busy. They were no longer idly sitting around, waiting for Chen Pingan to stroll through their small universe. In the past, they would line up neatly on the ground, looking up at him with mournful eyes, silently watching.

They were diligent little ones, never slacking off, but having someone like Chen Pingan, who was not particularly focused on cultivation, was akin to being a skilled cook without any rice—how could they not feel disheartened?

Now, the scene had completely transformed. The Water Palace was bustling with activity; the little ones ran around cheerfully, working diligently, finding joy in their tasks.

From a small pond resembling a narrow well, Chen Pingan scooped up water. Since the harvest from Cangjun Lake, he had reaped considerable rewards. In addition to several streams of exceptionally pure and rich water currents, he had also received a bottle of Water Pill from the Lake Lord. The green-robed boys split into two groups: one used their innate divine abilities to send strands of dark green water currents into the slowly rotating water character seal, while the other group, armed with tiny brushes that seemed to have appeared from nowhere, dipped them into the pond and then dashed toward the mural, carefully painting and adding color to the mural that depicted water currents in a meticulous style. 

They had already painted tiny water deities and slightly larger shrines on the vast mural, which Chen Pingan recognized as the water deities and shrines he had personally visited, including the Water Goddess of the submerged river in Tongyezhou, which should now be referred to as the Bi You Palace.

However, those water deities had yet to be animated, and the shrines lacked the lively scenes of incense wafting. For now, they remained as lifeless as the mural itself, lacking the vitality of the surging rivers depicted.

Standing beside the small pond, Chen Pingan looked down and saw a water dragon, carried in by the green-robed boys from Cangjun Lake, swimming lazily. It had not been directly refined by the little green figures, while another anomaly appeared: the Water Pill gifted by the Lake Lord had seemingly transformed into a small bead resembling a green "Li Pearl," which, no matter how the little dragon swam, remained suspended at its mouth, like a dragon holding a pearl, drifting through the rivers and clouds.

Chen Pingan planned to visit the Mountain Shrine next. Some of the green-robed boys smiled at him, raising their tiny fists, likely encouraging him to keep up his efforts.

With a touch of helplessness, Chen Pingan thought about the water currents. The more refined they appeared like jade, the more they represented the fundamental path of the water deities. Surely, it was not so simple to find; it was something as difficult to obtain as Immortal Money. Just imagine if someone were willing to offer one hundred Gu Yu coins to buy a foundational stone from a mountain shrine—Chen Pingan might acknowledge it as a profitable trade, but would he genuinely be willing to sell? It was merely a transaction on paper; the path of Dao cultivation should never be so calculative.

After leaving the Water Palace, Chen Pingan began to travel "visiting mountains." Standing at the foot of a mountain that resembled a blessed land, he looked up at the summit, where five-colored clouds swirled. The mountain appeared shrouded in fog and presented a grayish-black hue, still giving off an ethereal, uncertain feeling, while the majesty of the mountains paled in comparison to the previous Water Palace.

Fortunately, at the mountain's base, there were some shimmering white stones. However, compared to the towering mountain peak, this little patch of glistening white was pitifully small. Yet, it was already the result of Chen Pingan's arduous cultivation journey since leaving the Dragon Head Ferry in the Green Oriole Nation.

The foremost sword immortal of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Qingdu, with his keen insight, had predicted that if Chen Pingan's innate porcelain was not shattered, he had the potential of an Earth Immortal.

In the mundane sense, both Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators were considered Earth Immortals. But perhaps, in the eyes of that great sword immortal, there was no difference between the two.

Thus, Chen Pingan neither overestimated himself nor underestimated his worth. He understood that even with the same Water Palace and Mountain Shrine, if it were in the hands of a true genius like Qi Jinglong, the phenomenon would be much grander.

However, cultivators in the world were ultimately rare geniuses among the common multitude. If Chen Pingan lacked even this degree of composure, he would have already lost his spirit in the martial path at the Sword Qi Great Wall. As for cultivating, he would be repeatedly struck down until his mental state shattered, not much better than a broken bridge to immortality. The foundation of a Qi practitioner, like Chen Pingan's Earth Immortal potential, was akin to a naturally gifted "iron rice bowl." Yet, it still required one to talk about potential, which came in countless forms. Finding the cultivation method that suited oneself best was the true blessing.

Competing with others, whether in strength or reason, would always reveal shortcomings and lead to lifelong dissatisfaction. But competing with oneself would yield long-term benefits, accumulating every bit of progress as one's own foundation.

Every mistake made, as long as one could recognize and correct it, would seem like a stream that flows gently, even if the mental journey remains hard to erase. The riverbed remains, and there is no need to fear floods; this is the essence of cultivating the heart, ensuring that even in the face of great adversity, as long as one lives, their resolve will not collapse. By observing oneself through the lens of one's mindset, even if the mirror has cracks, one does not have to genuinely believe they have become unrecognizable.

Chen Pingan had once feared becoming one of the people atop the mountain, just as he feared becoming like Gu Can, the person he once despised most. For instance, the man who nearly killed Liu Xianyang in Mud Bottle Alley, the drunkard who had once kicked Gu Can in the stomach, and later, Fu Nanhua, the Mountain Moving Ape, and then Liu Zhimo and Jiang Shangzhen.

Chen Pingan even feared that the teachings of the old master of the Dao Viewing Temple, which he had repeatedly used to weigh worldly affairs and emotions, would one day quietly overshadow the orderly teachings of the venerable Confucian sage, without him even realizing it.

Yet, in truth, as he remained grounded, moving step by step, the truths of the world, regardless of which school of thought, were never fearsome. What was truly frightening was being unable to discern clearly while mistakenly believing one already "knew."

To truly open one's eyes is to see the light.

This phrase had come to Chen Pingan after he had closed his eyes in deep sleep atop the mountain and then opened them again, not only recalling the phrase but also seriously inscribing it on a bamboo slip.

On the bamboo slip, Chen Pingan recorded numerous poetic phrases, but the words he had truly comprehended were few and far between, carefully etched with gravity.

He left the five-colored "Mountain Shrine" and made his way to a pass.

The sword energy surged like a rainbow, like iron cavalry striking the gates, a tide of momentum that could never breach the impervious fortifications. This was the final barrier of the Sword Qi Eighteen Stops.

Chen Pingan stood at the mountain peak, facing the iron cavalry and the pass, sitting cross-legged in silence for a long while, propping his chin in thought.

Afterward, he went to two "Sword Mounds," locations for refining on the first and fifteenth days of each month.

The two flying swords, which appeared small and delicate in the eyes of mortals, towered like mountains within Chen Pingan's Qi Palace, suspended upside down on two vast, smooth mountain platforms. The sword tips rested against the stone platform that manifested as the Dragon-Slaying Platform, sparks flying everywhere, creating a magnificent scene of fire raining down upon the entire Qi Palace. Even though Chen Pingan had already experienced this scene before, each time he beheld it, his spirit would still sway.

One could imagine that if the two flying swords were to leave the confines of the small universe of his Qi Palace and return to the vast world, if they bore such an aura, how would those opposing him feel?

Chen Pingan's mind left the sword polishing area, retracting his thoughts and exiting the small universe.

In fact, there was another place that resembled a hermitage by a heart lake; however, seeing it or not seeing it made no difference.

Because it was all part of himself.

Even without the need for divine awareness, Chen Pingan was fully aware.

After opening his eyes, Chen Pingan gently exhaled a breath of turbid air, then continued to close his eyes, slowly refining the spiritual energy of the Water Palace and the Mountain Shrine through breath control.

Before long, dawn broke, and Chen Pingan stopped refining the spiritual energy. After practicing stances for an hour, he settled his bill and left the inn.

There were no immortal inns in Lu Jiu County, nor were there any significant immortal sects in the Kingdom of Fuqu. While it wasn't a vassal state of the Dayuan Dynasty, the emperors and ministers of the Kingdom of Fuqu throughout the ages had admired the cultural lineage of the Dayuan Dynasty, nearly to the point of obsession. Without discussing national strength, this aspect alone was somewhat reminiscent of the early literary scene of the Great Li Dynasty, where almost all scholars would eagerly focus on the moral essays and poetic works of the Lu Dynasty and the Great Sui. Even if one's own family produced great scholars, without the recognition of these two literary powerhouses, their works would still be seen as crude and inferior. 

There was once a young and wild scholar from the Lu Dynasty who claimed that even if he wrote poetry using his toes, it would still be better than anything produced by the barbarians of the Great Li Dynasty with sincerity.

Later, it was said that this wild scholar, who for years had been drinking and failing to gain recognition in the capital of the Lu Dynasty, encountered the hooves and blades of the iron cavalry under Song Changjing of the Great Li Dynasty. No one knew the exact details, but in the end, this man transformed into one of the bureaucratic officials stationed in the Great Li, later going to the Hanlin Academy in the capital, where he was responsible for compiling the history of the Lu Dynasty, personally writing the "Records of Loyal Ministers" and "Records of Sycophants," placing himself in the final chapter of the latter, and then it was said he hanged himself.

Some say it was the National Master Cui Zhan who detested this man and secretly poisoned him after he completed the two records, disguising it as a hanging. Others say that this wild scholar, who had never managed to secure an official position in the Lu Dynasty, became a historian for the Great Li and would place a good jug of wine on the table for every "Records of Loyal Ministers" he wrote, only writing at night, drinking as he penned, often shouting in the middle of the night. Whenever he wrote a "Records of Sycophants," he would do so during the day, claiming he wanted to expose these treacherous ministers to the light of day, then he would cough up blood, spitting it into an empty cup, which would eventually accumulate into a vat of regretful wine. Thus, it was neither a hanging nor a poisoning—it was a life spent in sorrow.

The neighboring country of the Kingdom of Fuqu had an immortal ferry with a dedicated route leading straight to the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven. The ferry route passed by most of the scenic mountains and waters along the Great Ditch, making multiple stops for passengers to enjoy the landscapes and explore hidden gems. This was essentially a sightseeing route, with the exchange of immortal goods being secondary. Had it not been for the connections to the Chongxuan Bureau and Yang Ningxing, visiting the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven would have been a must for Chen Pingan, as it was a famous place for making a fortune.

The Dragon Palace Cave Heaven was jointly held by three parties, including the Yang family of the Chongxuan Bureau from the Dayuan Dynasty and the sword immortal Li Cai of the Floating Duck Sword Lake.

Logically, the Floating Duck Sword Lake was an important charm for Chen Pingan's journey to the Dragon Palace Cave Heaven, which would surely help him avoid many unforeseen events. 

However, relationships, like spiritual offerings, should be conserved whenever possible. Following the customs of his hometown, it was better to save some for New Year's Eve and the first day of the new year.

Many casual friendships required a certain level of reciprocity, provided one could pay back at any time. 

Chen Pingan did not feel that he could currently return any favors to the likes of the Pei Ma Sect's Zhu Quan or the Floating Duck Sword Lake's Li Cai.

As for Qi Jinglong, he was an exception. 

Why bother being polite with him? 

That would be looking down on the vision of this land dragon in making friends.

Chen Pingan left Lu Jiu County City without incident, carrying the sword immortal on his back and holding a green bamboo staff, traversing mountains and rivers at a leisurely pace toward the neighboring country.

In the end, he had no opportunity to meet that self-proclaimed scholar, Lu Dun.

Life often unfolded this way—one meets, then parts ways, never to see each other again.

Without those encounters that leave one feeling like even if the world changes, stories linger in the heart.

Chen Pingan walked the path of cultivation.

So does everyone else. 

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 636: A Faraway Land**

The Kingdom of Shui Xiao was a renowned realm of lakes and rivers. Most of its cities, including the capital, were built upon islands of various sizes, making water transport bustling and boats plentiful. One notable stream leading into the lake was called Peach Blossom Water. Its waters were exceptionally gentle, flanked by peach trees on both banks. Tourists flocked here, many being distinguished scholars and elites from neighboring countries, drawn by its fame.

Chen Pingan followed this stream, choosing not to head directly to a lakeside county but instead veering off onto a small path that led to a celestial haven known as Peach Blossom Ferry. Those who practiced the Dao only needed to break through a simple illusionary barrier to access the ferry. Once inside this secret realm, their vision would open up to reveal a serene landscape: a green hill surrounded by a tranquil lake whose waters shimmered with a deep emerald hue. Above the ferry, white clouds hung perpetually in the sky, resembling a celestial figure adorned with a white crown. The ferryboats traversed the sea of clouds, making their true forms often invisible to ordinary mortals.

Peach Blossom Ferry belonged to the foremost celestial estate of the Shui Xiao Kingdom, the Colorful Sparrow Estate. The estate was entirely composed of female cultivators who spent years refining the waters of Peach Blossom and various celestial herbs and flowers. With a secret technique passed down from ancient times, they wove a special kind of Daoist robe known as a mountain gate ceremonial robe. The Colorful Sparrow Estate spared no effort or resources, producing only six of these robes each year. It was said that celestial masters from major mountain peaks in the central part of Baoping Continent had already booked their orders for a hundred years later, mostly for the direct disciples of the ancestral hall near the bottleneck of the lower five realms, as one of the congratulatory gifts for their eventual advancement to the middle five realms.

Chen Pingan was already well-acquainted with the ferry process. He entered the ornate building at the ferry terminal that bore the plaque "Spring at the Streamhead" to inquire about the ferry service. After paying, he received a peachwood token intricately engraved with a beautiful design, confirming his passage to the Dragon Palace cave heaven at midnight tonight. The ferry would make several stops along the way, allowing guests to disembark and explore various celestial attractions, a common practice seen in Baoping Continent's underground Dragon Roads and the osmanthus island of the Fan family in Old Dragon City. Passengers enjoyed the scenic views and often bought local celestial specialties, making it a mutually beneficial arrangement, with the ferry earning offerings from the various celestial locations.

The Colorful Sparrow Estate had set up a special workshop at the ferry terminal where visitors could watch the intricate weaving process of the Daoist robes. There was no need to pay any celestial fees; anyone could come and observe.

Naturally, Chen Pingan wouldn’t miss this opportunity. After entering, he walked slowly through the corridors, observing the young female cultivators who were diligently working in each room. As he moved further back, the robes nearing completion became increasingly radiant with precious light.

Chen Pingan actually contemplated purchasing one, but as a newcomer and a novice in the realm of Daoist robes, he worried about haggling for a price only to end up being taken advantage of. In many mountain trades, the celestial masters with lineage certainly had more bargaining power than those wild cultivators, and it was because these transactions were not one-off deals; sellers would consider the background of the buyer, while wild cultivators, often living on the edge, could lose their heads at any moment. Celestial masters preferred to maximize their profits rather than exchange favors with someone who might be in a precarious position.

Chen Pingan believed that the Colorful Sparrow Estate would keep one or two of the finest quality robes on hand, along with a reserve of treasured ceremonial robes for emergencies. However, they certainly wouldn’t entertain requests from ordinary cultivators.

Feeling a bit regretful that Qi Jinglong wasn’t around, Chen Pingan thought that if that guy were here, he could help negotiate a fair price with the female cultivators of the Colorful Sparrow Estate. After all, if a prominent fairy from the estate admired the earthly dragon from the North Ju Lu Continent, she would certainly sell him the robes at face value, and Chen Pingan wouldn’t be able to refuse that, right?

As he left the workshop, Chen Pingan was filled with a sense of longing. Regardless of the robe’s quality, even a low-ranking one from a sect was still valuable, especially for someone from a celestial lineage. 

The high prices of military-grade armors stem from this very sentiment.

Cultivation is for longevity, and time flows endlessly, indifferent to seasons. Yet, one fears the uncertainties. Celestial robes, like military-grade armors such as the Divine Exposure, Golden Crow's Thread, and the Three Treasures of Incense, are all meant to guard against those uncertainties. When cultivators descend the mountains to explore, the presence of a robe or armor makes all the difference.

Just after Chen Pingan exited the workshop, a woman with an impressive demeanor approached him slowly.

Since she was from the Colorful Sparrow Estate, Chen Pingan stopped and greeted her.

After she returned the gesture, she smiled and said, “I am Wu Qian, a lawmaster from the Ancestral Hall of the Colorful Sparrow Estate.” 

Chen Pingan felt puzzled as to why this prominent cultivator, who had not been in the workshop before, sought him out. He introduced himself, “My surname is Chen, and my given name is Haoren.” 

Without a trace of shame.

However, the name Wu Qian had a lovely meaning, not inferior to Chen Haoren's.

Having seen many passing cultivators, Wu Qian was unperturbed by his name and hesitated briefly before getting straight to the point. “May I ask if you know Liu Jinglong of the Taihui Sword Sect?”

Chen Pingan smiled, “Who in the North Ju Lu Continent doesn’t know Liu Jinglong?”

In the North Ju Lu Continent, people still preferred to refer to him by the name recorded in the Taihui Sword Sect’s Ancestral Hall, Liu Jinglong, rather than Qi Jinglong, his name before ascending the mountain.

Without delving into the details, Chen Pingan remained silent about any secret matters, and Wu Qian chuckled softly.

This answer lacked sincerity, but it was hard to find fault with it.

Wu Qian smiled and said, “Our estate lord is currently in seclusion, but the lord had the fortune to travel with Liu Jinglong for a while back in the day, which greatly benefited her cultivation. She has always held Liu Jinglong in high esteem. However, it has been years since Liu Jinglong has passed by our mountain, which our estate lord finds regrettable.”

In truth, Wu Qian’s words were a mix of truth and falsehood. The current young lord of the Colorful Sparrow Estate, by lineage, was her disciple, but her talent was significantly superior to that of her master. In the cultivation world, those with the greatest abilities were respected first. The young lord admired Liu Jinglong not only for his skill but also harbored feelings for him. Thus, this time, it wasn’t merely seclusion but rather a hurried pursuit, following a thread of clues from the previous sword sacrifice to the country of Fu Qu, hoping for a chance encounter. However, such matters were to be kept discreet, and Wu Qian couldn’t speak openly.

Chen Pingan understood immediately.

The estate lord's seclusion was a top priority for any celestial estate.

However, the tranquil atmosphere of the Colorful Sparrow Estate and Peach Blossom Ferry seemed inconsistent with this. Moreover, a lawmaster from the Ancestral Hall might not be the most powerful in a sect, but they often had considerable experience in cultivation. If it were genuinely a case of the estate lord being in seclusion, Wu Qian wouldn’t casually disclose information to an outsider. Considering the courteous words exchanged between the estate lord and Liu Jinglong, Chen Pingan figured it was likely they were trying to intercept Liu Jinglong’s return to the north.

Chen Pingan decided to drop any pretense. Since the other party had been sincere, he returned the favor, saying, “I do know Liu Jinglong quite well.” 

He reverted to their previous way of addressing each other.

Wu Qian’s heart trembled slightly, yet her expression remained calm.

Although she had her suspicions, upon hearing Chen Pingan admit to knowing Liu Jinglong, this Golden Core Earth Immortal felt an invisible pressure.

The reasoning was simple. Previously, in the relatively tranquil borders of the neighboring country Fu Qu, when Liu Jinglong summoned his sword, that unmistakable aura of "rules" was seen through by their estate lord, confirming his identity.

It was evident that next to Liu Jinglong’s destined flying sword, another sword immortal had also accompanied him in the sword summon, and it was a dual-sword attack!

It was the great sword immortal who had perished at the Sword Qi Great Wall alongside Liu Jinglong.

Wu Qian was no fool.

If this seemingly inscrutable black-robed swordsman arrived at Peach Blossom Ferry and even revealed his Earth Immortal sword cultivation, loudly proclaiming to be a close friend of that earthly dragon, Wu Qian would not believe a word of it.

But a stranger who could summon swords alongside Liu Jinglong at the mountain peak—regardless of whether he cried and shouted he didn’t know Liu Jinglong, Wu Qian would never believe it.

On the mountains of North Ju Lu Continent, regardless of whether they were from the lineage celestial masters or the wild cultivators, none feared that earthly dragon, because no one believed Liu Jinglong would indiscriminately kill innocents or bully others with his power.

However, at the same time, regardless of whether one was a top-tier cultivator in the upper five realms, one would still feel a tinge of fear when facing Liu Jinglong’s sword.

Even the most methodical swordsman, Liu Jinglong, who enjoyed discussing principles and reasoning, would choose to draw his sword in person. Who wouldn’t wonder if they were in the wrong, if they had lost their moral compass? Would they become a pariah, losing the protections they once thought were their due? In the world of cultivation, reputation was of utmost importance, even for demonic cultivators.

This was the true power of Liu Jinglong.

Thus, among the young ten of this generation in North Ju Lu Continent, the first and second, although vastly different in temperament, both regarded Liu Jinglong with awe. The others, including Xu Xuan, the only disciple of the North's greatest sword immortal Bai Chang, once publicly declared that the seven who followed Liu Jinglong were all worthless. This caused quite a stir, leading to the tale of the fourth-ranked wild cultivator, Huang Xi, attempting to assassinate Xu Xuan. However, the details and outcome were shrouded in secrecy, and Xu Xuan continued to avoid diligent cultivation, instead preferring to play the role of a weak scholar with two female sword attendants, while Huang Xi faded into obscurity for years.

Chen Pingan asked, “Senior Wu, does the Colorful Sparrow Estate have any spare robes for sale?”

Wu Qian smiled, “Of course we do, but the price isn’t cheap. The robes showcased in this workshop are only the lowest-tier robes, suitable for cultivators in cave dwelling realms, priced at fifteen Grain Rain coins. We also have two types of higher-tier robes, reserved for the Viewing Sea and Dragon Gate realms, as well as for Golden Core and Nascent Soul great cultivators.”

Wu Qian’s intention in coming forward was to gauge the status of Liu Jinglong’s friend, hoping to form a connection that could benefit the Colorful Sparrow Estate significantly.

In the mountain realm, everyone valued longevity, so they paid special attention to the subtleties of relationships.

A single incense offering made today could potentially lead to a great fortune in the coming year.

Of course, some seemingly trivial actions could also lead to disastrous consequences in the future.

Such was life in North Ju Lu Continent.

Thus, when approached with a request for robes, Wu Qian felt a bit more at ease.

Dealing with cultivators was the forte of the Colorful Sparrow Estate.

If their estate lord had no prior connections with Liu Jinglong, what could Liu Jinglong possibly discuss with her? Would they engage in philosophical debates or swordsmanship exchanges?

This was why Wu Qian was willing to come down the mountain; otherwise, if this outsider entered the ferry without the connection of Liu Jinglong, even if he wore a rare robe that the Colorful Sparrow Estate’s cultivators could recognize, Wu Qian would still choose to ignore him.

Chen Pingan asked, “May I inquire about the prices for both types?”

Wu Qian didn’t answer directly but smiled and invited, “Chen Xianshi, would you mind walking and talking? We have a tea house at Peach Blossom Ferry that brews tea using Peach Blossom Water. The tea leaves are unique to the back mountains of the Colorful Sparrow Estate, with only twelve ancient tea trees in total. During the pre-spring and rainy season, a rare bird called the Colorful Sparrow is tasked with picking the leaves. The tea is then refined by cultivators using a secret method. It was once praised by a great literary figure in a poem as ‘Little Xuanbi.’ The boiling tea reveals the wonders of tides and shifts of stars, and this tea house is not open to the public; we can go there to discuss in detail.”

Chen Pingan, of course, complied with local customs, willingly following.

If this Little Xuanbi tea could be purchased alongside the robes, that would be even better.

After all, Chen Pingan was still a wandering merchant, and rarity dictated value. As long as something was not exclusive to him, the price could be flexible.

He welcomed this promising business opportunity, reminiscent of when he had bought a complete set of goddess murals in the mural city, where he had bargained for a long time, almost becoming a shop assistant just to secure a better deal.

Upon arriving at the quiet tea house by the lakeside, Wu Qian and Chen Pingan entered a pavilion where a female cultivator was preparing tea. After an introduction from Wu Qian, Chen Pingan learned that she was the tea house’s proprietor.

Wu Qian mentioned that the Colorful Sparrow Estate had two top-tier ceremonial robes in their collection and sixteen mid-range robes, with striking price differences—fifteen Grain Rain coins for the top-tier ones, and just five for the mid-tier.

After considering, Chen Pingan acknowledged that he wanted to buy a robe, but not immediately.

It wasn’t that he couldn’t afford a top-tier robe from the Colorful Sparrow Estate; he was still making money during this journey. Not to mention, properties like the Chaotian Street in Chunlu Garden and the Jade Crystal Cliff he acquired from Liu Zhiqing were all valuable sources of celestial currency. Furthermore, Chen Pingan had some valuable items on him.

However, since he would be traveling extensively in the future, he didn’t see the robe as a necessity at this moment, so there was no rush.

Chen Pingan also decided not to be overly reserved and directly asked Wu Qian if the Colorful Sparrow Estate could hold two robes for him. He would give a definite answer within the next few years, regardless of whether he ended up buying them.

Wu Qian was genuinely worried about encountering a wealthy patron who might buy up all the robes in the Colorful Sparrow Estate’s collection, leading to a loss on their part. After all, the robes had always sold well.

Even if she had built a rapport with this young guest surnamed Chen, the Colorful Sparrow Estate would still feel the pinch.

But since he had made such a request, Wu Qian felt more relaxed, as reserving two robes was a small favor, and regardless of whether the transaction happened, he would owe the Colorful Sparrow Estate a debt of gratitude.

Thus, Wu Qian, who typically preferred to keep her conversations brief, found herself speaking more.

This surprised the tea house’s proprietor, who regarded the amiable young man with newfound respect.

After all, Wu Qian was a lawmaster from the mountain peak and typically did not personally involve herself in the estate’s business affairs.

Chen Pingan was remarkably patient; as long as Wu Qian spoke, he wouldn’t lower his head to drink tea. He only lifted his cup to sip once Wu Qian concluded her remarks, thanking the tea house’s proprietor each time she served tea.

Words and expressions could be feigned.

But one’s gaze and aura were hard to disguise.

The tea house proprietor grew increasingly convinced that this person had origins among the elite celestial families, like the highly regarded Yang Ning from the Yunxiao Palace.

During this time, Wu Qian naturally extolled the exquisite craftsmanship of the Colorful Sparrow Estate’s ceremonial robes.

In North Ju Lu Continent, the best-crafted treasures belonged to the spiritual armor crafted by the Sanlang Temple. The imitation flying swords from various sword immortals at Hate Sword Mountain, the tri-colored kasayas from the Buddhist Temple’s red, purple, and jade garments, and the crane cloak feather garments produced by the Chongxuan Bureau of the Dayuan Dynasty were all renowned. Additionally, there were four mountains, each possessing unique treasures, including the robes from Laojun Alley, which had an unparalleled sales record, although nearly all were monopolized by the Qionglin Sect, keeping the prices consistently high. Nonetheless, the luminous robes produced every sixty years from Laojun Alley remained the first choice for all upper five realm cultivators outside the sword immortals of North Ju Lu Continent.

Furthermore, Laojun Alley also provided the “Imperial Armor” for monarchs of secular dynasties, symbolizing the pinnacle of wealth and beauty.

Although ridiculed by mountain cultivators as “flowery garments” that looked good but were useless, they were still immensely revered by earthly rulers.

Next, there were the ceremonial robes of the Colorful Sparrow Estate.

Chen Pingan was well aware.

The Colorful Sparrow Estate fell short of Laojun Alley mainly due to a superior secret technique to craft robes similar to the upper five realm luminous robes, a rare opportunity. The latter two factors could be negotiated, perhaps by collaborating with the Qionglin Sect, the largest business entity in North Ju Lu Continent, allowing the Colorful Sparrow Estate to retain critical techniques while Qionglin assisted with resources. However, this approach could easily lead the Colorful Sparrow Estate to become a subordinate sect over time. 

Besides, the Qionglin Sect's reputation in North Ju Lu Continent wasn’t exactly stellar.

Numerous “couplets” had been composed by mountain cultivators regarding the wealth-generating Qionglin Sect, particularly the old master who had amassed his wealth through celestial money.

Aside from the most popular couplet, “Two Sleeves of Clear Wind—Qionglin Sect, Flowery Pillow of the Upper Five Realms,” there were many others that were even more cutting.

“Affordable and Great Value—Qionglin Sect, Unmatched in the Upper Five Realms.” 
“Honest and Transparent—Qionglin Sect, Crushing the Sword Immortal in the Upper Five Realms.” 
“Never Cheating—Qionglin Sect, Real Talent in the Upper Five Realms.”

Sipping tea in the lakeside pavilion, with the gentle breeze, both parties conversed merrily.

Chen Pingan intended to rest here while waiting for the ferry to the Dragon Palace cave heaven. He spoke with Wu Qian, who graciously agreed, even instructing the tea house proprietor to attend to him well.

After Wu Qian departed, Chen Pingan expressed his apologies for any inconvenience caused, causing the tea house’s female cultivator to feel flattered, and she offered a polite comment about the “sword immortal drinking tea, enhancing the ambiance.”

As night fell, Chen Pingan sat alone in the pavilion, closing his eyes to rest.

The clear night was devoid of dust, and the moonlight shone like silver.

In the stillness of the night, with the moon illuminating a foreign land, one could easily feel the longing buried deep within.

I miss someone, who is far away.

Ning girl is one, and Liu Xianyang is too. As for that little snot-nosed child from Mud Bottle Alley, it’s probably even more so.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 637: An Accidental Encounter

At the hour of the pig, the practitioners of Dao were once again praised for their dedication. 

Especially for the Daoist Qi practitioners, this hour was deemed crucial for cultivation—a perfect moment for quiet contemplation and focus, offering an unparalleled natural tranquility. 

Chen Pingan, needing to catch the ferry departing at the hour of the rat, reluctantly relinquished his peaceful mindset. He withdrew his focused thoughts from his personal little world and ceased to watch the scene of sword qi striking the gate from his perch on the mountain. He rose, preparing to set off.

To his surprise, the owner of the tea house approached him, carrying a beautiful green porcelain tea canister and standing at a distance from the water pavilion. 

Chen Pingan quickly walked over. After the lady cultivator from the Caijue Mansion had completed her greeting ritual, she presented the lovely glazed canister with a smile. “Master Chen, this is this shop's harvest of the year—small Xuanbi tea. A small gift, nothing too grand.”

Chen Pingan accepted the green porcelain canister and asked, “Does the tea house still have any small Xuanbi left? I’d like to buy some.” 

The lady cultivator shook her head apologetically. “There are only a few old tea trees on the back mountain of Caijue Mansion, and many have been reserved. Our tea house's share is already quite limited, and there’s not much left now.” 

Chen Pingan laughed. “Then I’m just getting a can of tea for free.” 

The lady cultivator nodded, smiling without a word. 

Chen Pingan inquired, “Is there a report on the landscapes of Taohuadu after autumn that I can purchase? I’ve missed quite a bit while traveling from Longtou Ferry in Green Oriole Country.” 

The lady cultivator replied, “We have some at the tea house. Master Chen doesn’t need to pay; it holds no meaning for us to keep them.” 

Chen Pingan lifted the tea canister, saying helplessly, “It doesn’t feel right to drink tea for free with Senior Wu, take a can of small Xuanbi for free, and then request a few reports on the landscapes for free as well.” 

The lady cultivator chuckled. “Three times is just right.” 

Chen Pingan sighed in resignation. “That makes sense.” 

These little favors were indeed genuine gestures of goodwill. 

He recalled how Sun Jiashu from Old Dragon City had first entertained him, the lady owner of Qingfu Workshop who had deliberately concealed her identity, and now this lady cultivator from the tea house—all of them were quite adept at these customs. 

He noted them down in his mind.

On the journey of life, there were too many sights to behold. One mustn’t forget along the way, and sometimes it’s perfectly fine to do so.

The lady cultivator asked Chen Pingan to wait a moment while she went to fetch three copies of the immortal’s landscape reports as gifts for her esteemed guest. 

After leaving the tea house, Chen Pingan began to peruse the reports while walking.

Wu Qun’s warm hospitality was straightforward enough. 

Given the proximity to Fuhua Country and following his and Qi Jinglong's sacrificial sword rituals, the commotion was considerable. 

Though the landscape reports of Beiju Luzhou appeared to be unconstrained, there was an unwritten rule: once a sword immortal perished at the Sword Qi Great Wall, news would swiftly return to Beiju Luzhou, and any sacrificial sword rituals would not be recorded in the landscape reports. 

Qi Jinglong had clearly stated his reasons; it wasn’t something to be taken lightly. 

The customs of the world all have their reasons. 

At the water pavilion, the grandmaster Wu Qun sat in his original position, though the opposite seat was now empty. He had no desire to drink tea anymore and simply sat quietly, admiring the moonlit lake with its shimmering waves. 

The lady cultivator stood on the steps outside the pavilion. 

Wu Qun asked, “Has there been any news from the Great Seal Capital? Has no mountain head managed to get insider information to write in the landscape reports?” 

The lady cultivator shook her head. “It seems the Emperor of the Lu family in the Great Seal Capital issued a decree forbidding any leak of information. At that time, there were very few who observed the battle from the city walls or by the Jade Seal River. With that sage from the academy personally overseeing the area, no one dared to let an earth immortal eavesdrop on the situation. Even the divine beings observing the mountains and rivers with their powers were hesitant to do so.” 

Wu Qun chuckled. “That sage certainly has a temper. However, after he acted twice, the central mountains and valleys of Beiju Luzhou indeed stabilized quite a bit.” 

The lady cultivator curiously asked, “Grandmaster Wu, why not directly gift that Master Chen a fine robe?” 

Wu Qun gestured for this junior disciple to take a seat. Once she sat down, he smiled and replied, “To cater to one’s preferences. For those who value rules and etiquette, we shall adhere to them. For the greedy and lustful, we need different calculations.” 

The lady cultivator cautiously said, “It’s just a can of small Xuanbi. Master Chen was truly delighted to accept it.” 

Wu Qun glanced at this intelligent junior disciple who assisted in welcoming esteemed guests to the Caijue Mansion tea house. 

Being the owner of the tea house that entertains celestial guests, she naturally possessed a keen mind. 

But sitting in such a position implied that her path in cultivation was already dim, akin to the difficult situation faced by most ferry managers in this world. 

Wu Qun preferred not to elaborate further. 

Cultivators see things more through introspection. 

Discussing matters that touch the essence of cultivation with this junior disciple would hit close to home. 

After all, she treated others with careful consideration and never acted impulsively, which was enough for him. 

Wu Qun sighed. 

He wondered if his mansion's master had met that land-bound dragon. 

There were many stories worth telling about this Liu Jinglong of the Taihui Sword Sect, who was not just some innate sword embryo. 

Yet many of the rumors and events surrounding him were too distant from a third-rate celestial force like the Caijue Mansion. However, the mansion's master had traveled with Liu Jinglong in the past, and she never concealed her admiration for him. She openly asked others about matters of love, even consulting Wu Qun for advice, which filled the lady cultivator with curiosity and yearning for Liu Jinglong. 

In general, women admired the charisma of sword immortals, while men were infatuated with celestial maidens. 

Thus, Wu Qun was genuinely curious about how those celestial couples on the mountains managed to stay united through thick and thin. Were they truly able to stand by each other in times of great peril? 

Wu Qun did not know and hoped he would never have to learn, wishing only to focus on his cultivation. Sadly, he was well aware of his own limitations—he was merely waiting for death. 

Thinking of this, Wu Qun instructed the tea house owner to fetch two jugs of wine. 

The lady cultivator hesitated at first. 

Wu Qun laughed, “What’s wrong with drinking wine at the tea house? Besides, I’m the grandmaster of the Caijue Mansion—who dares to stop me?” 

Only then did the lady cultivator rise, her steps lighter as she went to fetch the wine. 

Even the grandmaster Wu Qun acted this way; how could a cultivator like her, who had little hope in her path, not secretly indulge in wine to drown her sorrows while guarding this modest tea house year after year?

A colorful rainbow beam descended from the sky, gracefully landing on the lake and entering the water pavilion. She was strikingly beautiful, sitting across from Wu Qun, and muttered, “Drinking is good; let me join.” 

Wu Qun smiled, “Things not going well? Is that Liu person still the lumbering blockhead the mansion master speaks of?” 

The lady sitting opposite him was none other than the young mansion master of Caijue Mansion, Sun Qing, a renowned lady cultivator, and technically Wu Qun’s junior. 

Sun Qing shook her head. “Liu Jinglong has changed a lot. During our last meeting, he spoke frankly and directly—though I understand his reasoning, I still feel a bit displeased.” 

Wu Qun asked in confusion, “What did he say?” 

The young mansion master waved her hand dismissively. “Let’s not talk about it; it’s somewhat embarrassing.” 

Wu Qun was left speechless. 

She had already confronted him; what was there to be shy about? 

But Wu Qun was genuinely puzzled. Although his mansion master wasn’t an extraordinary genius, she was still a nearly century-old Golden Core-level cultivator and one of the ten celestial maidens of Beiju Luzhou. It wouldn’t raise any eyebrows if an upper fifth realm sword immortal actively sought to become her celestial partner. 

However, in terms of practical calculations, it was fair to say that his mansion master was no match for the Water Journey Mountain’s maiden, Lu Sui, who not only rose to the top ten alongside Liu Jinglong but was also more beautiful than Sun Qing. 

Wu Qun softly asked, “Have you completely given up on Liu Jinglong?” 

Sun Qing laughed heartily. “How could that be? I like him even more!” 

Wu Qun put a hand to his forehead, speechless. 

How could the most reasonable Liu Jinglong be so unreasonable? 

The three of them began to drink. 

The lady cultivator remained somewhat reserved, but when three female cultivators of varying statuses intentionally dropped their cultivation powers, they would become drunk, their cheeks blooming like peach blossoms. 

In the end, they were just women. 

When women spoke of risqué topics, there were no more restrictions. 

It had a unique charm that was particularly captivating. 

———

One large and one small, riding the wind northward towards the Taihui Sword Sect, Qi Jinglong was moving slowly to care for his newly recruited disciple, Bai Shou, whose cultivation was not very high. 

Then they unexpectedly encountered the young mansion master Sun Qing halfway. 

Qi Jinglong now had considerable confidence, casually conversing with the celestial maiden. 

The extremely beautiful Sun Qing remained unchanged throughout their interaction. 

However, after she took her leave, the young Bai Shou shook his head, clicking his tongue. “That Liu guy, such a beautiful celestial sister actually likes you—he must be blind. If I remember correctly, the mansion master Sun is one of the ten celestial maidens of Beiju Luzhou. Liu, my friend, it’s not that I’m criticizing you; even if you don’t want a celestial partner, I believe Sun Qing would agree to you. How could you pass up such a good opportunity?” 

Qi Jinglong, feeling somewhat relieved, continued on his journey northward with the young boy. He laughed, “Trying to reason with you, especially about love, is like playing a lute to a cow.” 

Bai Shou angrily retorted, “Are you just full of hot air? Why not take me back to cut deer mountain?” 

Qi Jinglong replied slowly, “Rather than have one more sword cultivator who kills for money in Beiju Luzhou, I’d prefer to see a truly accomplished young sword immortal.” 

Qi Jinglong continued, “Don’t worry, once you join the Taihui Sword Sect and register at the Ancestor Hall, you won’t have to identify yourself as a disciple of the Taihui Sword Sect. You don’t even have to acknowledge me as your master. Within the rules, you just need to wield your sword; neither I nor the sect will bind your spirit. However, you must clearly understand the rules of our sect. I don’t want to hear you say you don’t understand the rules when I have to punish you in the future.” 

Bai Shou sulked. 

He had no interest in the rules of the Taihui Sword Sect or Liu Jinglong; he thought they were dull, rigid, and utterly boring. 

What’s so great about being a disciple of a scholarly immortal or a sword immortal? 

It couldn’t compare to the freedom of being an assassin from Deer Cutting Mountain. 

In the martial world, one ought to embody heroism and swift revenge; the assassins of Deer Cutting Mountain need not care about such things. As long as they got paid, they could kill without a care, and that was true freedom. 

Qi Jinglong remained silent for a moment, then softly said, “Whether you want to listen or not, I need to tell you—so long as you abide by the rules, no matter who you draw your sword against in the future, whether you lose or get beaten up, just let me know when you return. I will reason with them until they understand.” 

Bai Shou crossed his arms, “Don’t kid me! A talent like me, having trained in the sword, would lose to anyone? Fine, I can’t take on a sword immortal for now, but for my peers, if they hop in front of me, I could easily slice them to pieces with a single strike.” 

“When you truly start training, you won’t have much energy left for boasting,” Qi Jinglong laughed. “As for not needing my help to reason, it would be best if you could draw your sword; that alone is already a form of reasoning.” 

Though Bai Shou looked unconvinced, he couldn’t help but catch a glimpse of Liu Jinglong's profile from the corner of his eye. 

The youth’s heart still felt a bit different. 

Like a tattered child in the harsh winter of his youth, basking under an elusive, warm sun. 

But this feeling was fleeting. 

Suddenly, Bai Shou exclaimed, “If I memorize the rules of the Ancestor Hall of the Taihui Sword Sect, will you allow me to drink?” 

Qi Jinglong shook his head. “No money.” 

Bai Shou angrily retorted, “No money in your pocket? Don’t you know how to chalk up a tab with that Chen guy?” 

Qi Jinglong thought for a moment, “I’m afraid of being pressured to drink, so it’s not worth it.” 

The previous money for buying wine had been borrowed from another sect, Tai Xia. 

Qi Jinglong never took extra cash or belongings when he left the sect for practice. 

Eating the essence of sunlight and moonlight, and absorbing the spirit of the heavens and earth, was all a cultivator needed for sustenance. 

As the most powerful sword cultivator in the world, he had no need for robes or any precious weapons. 

While borrowing money from her, he thankfully refrained from saying a word that could lead to further complications. 

Qi Jinglong initially intended to say he would repay it when passing by Tai Xia Mountain next time. 

But in a flash, he realized that such words would certainly lead her to misunderstand his intentions, thinking he wanted to get close to her, Gu Mo. So it was better not to say anything and just keep it in mind. 

After reflecting on this, Qi Jinglong felt that perhaps he had learned something by association, opening one door would open many others. 

Bai Shou asked, “Liu, does your Taihui Sword Sect have any particularly pretty girls? You know, those beautiful girls around my age!” 

Qi Jinglong asked in confusion, “What’s the matter?” 

Bai Shou sighed. “When they meet me, they’re truly unfortunate, destined to be infatuated with a man who won’t like them.” 

Qi Jinglong laughed. “Who taught you that?” 

Bai Shou replied firmly, “That guy who calls himself Chen the Good Man!” 

Qi Jinglong shook his head, then hesitated, realizing that guy would go to any lengths to convince others to drink, undoubtedly pouring a lot of his character into the wine jug. So he asked, “Did he really tell you that?” 

Bai Shou began to embellish the story. 

Qi Jinglong chuckled; it seemed not to be the case. 

Bai Shou was puzzled about how Liu Jinglong knew it wasn’t that guy who taught him. 

Qi Jinglong looked into the distance, “Later, come with me to meet two gentlemen; remember to say less and listen more.” 

Bai Shou slapped his forehead. 

Now hearing the word “gentlemen,” he felt a headache coming. 

In a golden sea of clouds, two cultivators stood side by side. 

One was a tall, middle-aged man in a scholar's robe, with a jade token hanging from his waist. 

The other was an elderly cultivator, bent over and carrying a long sword on his back. 

The former was the sage of the academy, currently the most famous figure in Beiju Luzhou, named Zhou Mi, who hailed from the Ritual Learning Academy of the Central Divine Continent. It was said that the academy's grand ritual wine would gift this disciple the title “Mighty Anger.” 

Indeed, after leaving the academy, this person had beaten down two unrestrained great cultivators without any chance of retaliation, loudly demanding, “Have you communicated?” What could those two great cultivators do but say they had? As a result, they received another beating, followed by a disdainful, “You call that communication?” 

However, Qi Jinglong certainly knew that this sage’s knowledge was truly exceptional, not only proficient in his craft but also well-versed in Buddhist and Daoist teachings. He had been praised by someone as “rigorously scholarly, impenetrable; gentle, respectful, and a pillar of talent.” In fact, if the sixteen-character evaluation had only twelve characters, no one would question it. Unfortunately, due to the four words “gentle, respectful,” this scholar from the Ritual Learning Academy faced considerable controversy. Just imagine, a student about to head to a different continent to become the academy sage would be given the title “Mighty Anger”—how could it possibly be related to “gentle, respectful”? 

Yet Zhou Mi took great pride in those four words. He never acknowledged the other twelve. 

The elderly cultivator, carrying a sword, was named Dong Zhu, a fallen Jade Purity Realm sword cultivator. He was a great cultivator who, despite reaching the immortal realm years ago, had never founded a sect. Instead, he continued to view himself as a wild cultivator of the mountains and valleys. For over a hundred years, he had been seriously injured and needed to recuperate on his own mountain; otherwise, every outing would be a torment. That was why he hadn’t traveled to the Hanging Mountain. 

There were rumors that sword immortal Dong Zhu was actually the preacher of the young wild cultivator Huang Xi, but neither side ever confirmed or denied it, leaving the public to speculate wildly. Since Huang Xi wasn’t a sword cultivator, most mountain heads deemed the matter absurd. 

During Qi Jinglong's battle with Huang Xi, he had similar thoughts. 

However, after truly engaging, Qi Jinglong found it hard to judge. 

Huang Xi was indeed a sword cultivator and possessed two of his life’s flying swords. 

The reason Huang Xi chose to reveal his identity as a sword cultivator rather than escape was undoubtedly due to his opponent, Liu Jinglong. 

In fact, over the years, Qi Jinglong had never mentioned it to anyone. 

As Qi Jinglong and Bai Shou descended before the two seniors, he bowed and saluted. 

Dong Zhu looked disapprovingly at this promising young sword cultivator, questioning why he was learning from a scholar. 

He found it quite unpleasant. 

Had it not been for Zhou Mi discovering Qi Jinglong’s whereabouts and insisting on a conversation, he wouldn’t have bothered to waste a single word with this land-bound dragon. 

If they were to truly interact, it would be after Qi Jinglong broke through to the Jade Purity Realm, and Dong Zhu would go to the Taihui Sword Sect to seek a sparring match! 

Bai Shou was most annoyed by these formalities and rituals. He simply hid behind Qi Jinglong, playing the part of a wooden figure. If they didn’t know him, he certainly didn’t know them; what was the point of exchanging pleasantries? 

Qi Jinglong didn’t force the boy. 

Everything could wait until they reached the Taihui Sword Sect. 

Sage Zhou Mi appeared to be an ordinary scholar at first glance, with an elegant appearance. He straightforwardly said, “Currently, neither of the two sword immortals of the Taihui Sword Sect are stationed at the mountain. You are about to break through; should the three of us ask about swords, would you like me to help stabilize the situation? So no one uses this custom to suppress you and the Taihui Sword Sect.” 

Qi Jinglong bowed again and, upon rising, smiled, “No need for Master Zhou to stabilize the situation. Whether it’s three swords or three swords, even if there are seniors with ulterior motives, I cannot stop them, nor will I blame the heavens or others.” 

Zhou Mi turned to smile at Dong Zhu. 

Dong Zhu grinned, “Alright, count me in. Add in Li Cai from Floating Duck Pond; the last one is the most dangerous.” 

Dong Zhu addressed the young man in green, “Don’t thank me; when I ask about swords, I won’t cut corners. Just don’t come crying to me later; I won’t be responsible for any typos.” 

Qi Jinglong nodded, saying, “Respectfully, I shall not express my gratitude.” 

Zhou Mi smiled knowingly. 

Dong Zhu rubbed his chin, “What makes you so cheeky?” 

Qi Jinglong smiled. “Let me break through first, then we’ll see.” 

The boy eavesdropping behind Qi Jinglong quietly thought, “Cut him, cut him, don’t hesitate. Once I’ve dealt with that Liu guy, I can run away.” 

Zhou Mi laughed, “How did you end up with such a disciple?” 

Qi Jinglong replied, “He has a good heart; the difficult ones need to be taught well.” 

Zhou Mi hummed in agreement. “That’s a fair point.” 

Bai Shou sighed. 

Dong Zhu also felt bored. 

In fact, the duo of old and young gathered together might have plenty to talk about. 

Zhou Mi said, “Qi Jinglong, I came to see you this time to discuss the matter of stabilizing the situation for your breakthrough. Since it’s unnecessary, I can save some effort.” 

Qi Jinglong hesitated for a moment, then asked, “Master Zhou, may I inquire about the outcome of a certain matter?” 

Zhou Mi smiled, “You care about this? What, do you have some connection with those two?” 

Qi Jinglong recalled the guy who had received three punches from Gu You and chuckled. “A bit.” 

Zhou Mi said, “Let’s walk and talk. I can share some insights on scholarly matters and irritate Dong Zhu a bit; that will make this trip worthwhile.” 

Dong Zhu had no other option. 

Zhou Mi’s foul temper was precisely to Dong Zhu’s taste; he asked for it. 

Dong Zhu didn’t want to discuss scholarly principles with these two well-read fellows. 

He glanced sideways at the boy. 

The boy shot back a glance. 

Dong Zhu glared, “Hey, haven’t you heard of the name of Sword Immortal Dong?” 

The boy shot back, “What if I have? I have parents and ancestors of my own; I’m not related to you.” 

Dong Zhu clicked his tongue. “You little brat, you’ve got some guts.” 

Bai Shou raised an eyebrow. “When I reach the upper fifth realm, you can come and test your sword against me. By then, you’ll know who has the guts.” 

Dong Zhu gave Bai Shou’s head a playful smack, sending him sprawling on the ground, laughing, “Do you realize what you just said? It’s like a little kid still in their diaper trying to act like a seasoned pro in the flower fields! Who taught you that? Your master Liu Jinglong?” 

Bai Shou stood up, not retaliating against the old man. He wasn’t foolish enough to act recklessly. A man must know when to be flexible. 

Bai Shou coldly huffed, “Liu isn’t my master. I only have one master in this lifetime, but I have a drinking buddy I haven’t truly acknowledged yet, called Chen the Good Man! If you have the guts, go find him—bullying me is nothing that a senior should do; he could make you run home crying with a single strike!” 

Qi Jinglong turned his head, frowning, “Bai Shou!” 

The boy immediately feigned illness. “Fine, for now, Chen the Good Man is still not as good as the old senior.” 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 638: Parting Whispers

On the ferry, Chen Ping'an had already put away the various reports from the mountain and river district. He hadn’t turned to the page with the outcome he wanted to know; the latest report from the capital city made no mention of the recent events there.

The battle between the Boundary End Warrior Gu You and the Sword Immortal Ji Yue from the Monkey Crying Mountain remained shrouded in uncertainty for both fighters.

Previously, Qi Jinglong had mentioned this matter, asserting that Gu You had always acted with caution throughout his life. He would never engage in a reckless duel for the sake of pride, nor would he venture to the Jade Seal River merely to meet his death in a duel with Ji Yue.

Standing at the bow of the ferry, Chen Ping'an flipped through several reports, and while he didn’t find the information he sought, he did uncover some noteworthy details. For instance, in ten days’ time, there would be a major battle on the Zhi Li Mountain. The two parties involved had significant backgrounds: one was the renowned wild cultivator Huang Xi, and the other was the female warrior Xiu Niang. Both were among the top ten young figures in the Northern Julu Continent, ranked closely—Huang Xi at fourth and Xiu Niang at fifth. The reasons behind this deadly confrontation varied between reports; some suggested Huang Xi had returned to his old ways, clashing with the oddly-named female warrior in the martial world, while others claimed they had quarreled over a precious artifact in a shattered cave paradise and, unable to settle their dispute, agreed to duel on Zhi Li Mountain.

This battle was highly anticipated and would surely draw the attention of many practitioners from the Upper Five Realms. One could easily imagine that the mountain near Zhi Li, which had been bought by the Qionglin Sect and had numerous immortal residences built upon it, would be crowded at that time.

On the cross-continent ferry belonging to the Pima Sect, Chen Ping'an had purchased a spirit artifact—a porcelain brush wash adorned with a powder-blue glaze that gleamed beautifully. However, he later learned he could simply charge it to his account at Piyun Mountain.

Surprisingly, the mountain and river reports also contained several pieces of news regarding the Baoping Continent, and they were quite extensive. This indicated a significant shift in perception toward the previously overlooked Baoping Continent, especially after the cavalry of the Great Li Song clan began their march from the northernmost region, heading toward the southern end at Old Dragon City. It was evident that the practitioners from other continents had begun to recognize the smallest continent in the vast world of Haoran.

The true master of the Great Li cavalry was the Boundary End Warrior Song Changjing.

After challenging the Celestial Monarch Xie Shi, he made his way to the Snowstorm Temple Sword Immortal Wei Jin at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Both individuals had made monumental contributions.

Then there was the Zhenwu Mountain's Ma Kuxuan, who had, in just six months, killed two formidable Golden Core sword cultivators from the Zhu Ying Dynasty, earning him the title of the top young practitioner of the Baoping Continent in the Northern Julu reports. He had single-handedly decimated the Tide Iron Riders, leaving the family that had made an enemy of him humiliated. A young female cultivator had miraculously survived and had become Ma Kuxuan's personal maid. In the eyes of the lead writer of one report, someone like Ma Kuxuan, who was so favored by fate, should not have been born on the Baoping Continent; instead, he ought to be rooted in the Northern Julu Continent, establishing his own sect like the female sect leader He Xiaoliang of the Qingliang Sect. It was a pity that he was destined to flourish like a dragon in a shallow pond, flapping its tail in vain.

The writer also announced that he would soon compile a list of the ten young practitioners of the Baoping Continent and then compare it with the new ten from his own Northern Julu.

The articles in the Northern Julu reports tended to emanate a sense of superiority over the Baoping practitioners. However, this was a stark contrast to the earlier days when they wouldn’t even bother to glance at it.

In addition, there was news about the Great Li’s North Peak Master Wei Bo breaking through his limits. There were auspicious omens and continuous good signs within his domain, indicating he was on the verge of becoming a Mountain God of the Upper Five Realms. This clearly showed that the fortunes of the Great Li Song clan were flourishing and should not be underestimated. The reports began to advise Northern Julu merchants to bet on the Great Li dynasty early; otherwise, if they arrived late, they might miss out on the profits. There were also subtle mentions of the Pima Sect, praising the sect leader Zhu Quan, as it was rumored that the Bone Beach’s wooden garment mountain had already established connections with the Great Li’s North Peak.

Moreover, there was a detailed discussion in the reports about the subordinate sect of the Yuguan Sect from Tongye Continent, which had chosen Shujian Lake as its location.

As Chen Ping'an read those texts, he could almost feel the writer's gritting teeth.

There was no choice.

The first sect leader of the Zhenjing Sect, Jiang Shangzhen, was someone whose cultivation level was not particularly high yet caused headaches for the Northern Julu practitioners.

This fellow had single-handedly harmed three of the ten fairy maidens from the Northern Julu in their early years. It was also rumored that two other stunning female cultivators had crossed paths with Jiang Shangzhen back then. However, whether or not there were heart-wrenching romantic entanglements remained unclear.

Thus, towards the end of the report, there was a vehement attack on the Great Li cavalry and the new emperor of the Song clan, calling them foolish for allowing the Zhenjing Sect to successfully choose a site and establish themselves in the central region of the Baoping Continent. If the Great Li Song clan had secretly colluded with Jiang Shangzhen, they would be in even deeper trouble, as there were better options than partnering with a treacherous person like him. This clearly indicated that the so-called Great Li Embroidered Tiger, who betrayed his own master and exterminated his ancestors, was not that remarkable either. Even if he had snatched an entire continent through sheer luck, he could not secure his empire and would merely be a fleeting phenomenon.

The report, which had initially been meticulously worded, with logical arguments and beautiful prose, fell apart when it came to the Zhenjing Sect and Jiang Shangzhen, degenerating into vulgar expletives, akin to a literate market woman.

Chen Ping'an was genuinely curious about the origins of these mountain and river reports.

Back when he was at Shujian Lake, he had only learned a few superficial details.

Even earlier, while in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, there was a building shrouded in mist known as the Admiration Tower, which specialized in gathering and collecting murky tidings from the martial world.

Returning to the cabin of the ferry, Chen Ping'an retrieved a booklet written by the ferry, detailing various scenic spots along the route.

After departing from Peach Blossom Ferry, the first scenic spot was a sect located near the borders of the Water Cloud Kingdom, named Yungshang City. Its founding patriarch, through serendipity, traveled to the Luminous Cloud Continent and acquired a half-refined sea of clouds from a broken cave paradise. Initially, it only occupied an area of ten miles radius, but later, it established itself in the relatively water-rich border of the Water Cloud Kingdom. Through the continuous refinement and empowerment by successive patriarchs, it absorbed the essence of mist and fortified the sea of clouds with cloud runes. Now, the sea of clouds had expanded to over thirty miles in radius.

The ferry would remain at Yungshang City for six hours, hovering at the city’s edge.

Before dawn, the ferry slowly came to a halt.

Chen Ping'an halted his practice of the Three Stances Unity Fist, returning from a state of half-sleep and half-wakefulness. When he stepped out of the cabin, he slung a pack over his back.

Outside Yungshang City, there was a market bustling with wild cultivators, where they traded goods from the mountains, all set up by fellow cultivators.

Chen Ping'an took out some not-so-valuable spirit artifacts from his pack, which were leftovers he hadn’t sold back at the old Huai Street. While their quality wasn’t impressive, they were relatively rare and had an appealing appearance, suitable for selling to those who believed that an item worth a fortune was worth having, even if they had to pay a premium for it. This time, however, he was primarily selling a few talismans unrelated to the "True Record of Dan," most of which came from the secret manuals of the formation master among the first batch of assassins from the Deer Cutting Mountain. Among them were three types: the Thunder Department Talisman, the Great River Flowing Talisman, and the Earth Binding Talisman, all effective in battles.

Before leaving, Qi Jinglong had also taught Chen Ping'an two unconventional barrier-breaking talismans, named the "Bai Ze Road Guidance Talisman" and the "Sword Qi Bridge Talisman." Both were learned from ancient texts and did not involve any sect secrets. Although their quality wasn't high, outsiders wouldn't be able to learn them easily, as the techniques for drawing talismans were intricate and cumbersome, differing greatly from the core teachings of several current talisman schools. It was only because Qi Jinglong had explained the techniques thoroughly that Chen Ping'an was able to learn these two talismans.

Therefore, Chen Ping'an often felt it was a pity that Qi Jinglong didn’t teach at a school.

Warriors drawing talismans adhered to a pure essence of true qi, but their talismans were not long-lasting; they could only open mountains but not seal them. The advantage was that it didn’t consume the spiritual energy of the practitioner, and drawing talismans itself was a rather uncommon form of cultivation, capable of refining one’s true qi. However, Chen Ping'an found that after reaching the third level of Qi Refining, drawing talismans became much smoother, though the physical benefits had become quite minimal. He was reluctant to use up too much talisman paper, as a talisman that couldn’t retain spiritual energy equated to losing divine money every moment.

Moreover, once a real battle began, his limited knowledge of talismans wouldn’t suffice; it wouldn’t even be a mere embellishment but rather a hindrance to seizing the opportunity.

However, for cultivators, drawing talismans initially sealed the mountain, allowing the spiritual energy to dissipate slowly. Yet the greater the talisman’s power, the more easily its core would wear down. It was said that the ancestral masters who vanquished demons at the Longhu Mountain Tianshi Mansion had a forbidden area. To maintain one talisman, each generation of Grandmasters would need to empower it once every sixty years. Historically, there had been a massive upheaval at the Tianshi Mansion when the last Grandmaster ascended, and the new Grandmaster was undecided during the crucial period of the talisman’s empowerment. Because the new Grandmaster had not yet emerged, the Tianshi Seal could not be passed to another, resulting in the creation of a new talisman, leading to a slight flaw in an ancient talisman that had existed for many years. This allowed a tremendous demon that had been suppressed for countless years to escape, which led to the new Grandmaster’s first task being a disastrous visit to Baidi City, where he quarreled with the city’s Lord.

Chen Ping'an's talismans were all drawn after the Water Palace Mountain had formed a mountain-water relationship. Otherwise, it would be a scam. Although the business of the Packing Room relied on the discernment of both parties, similar to the antique trade in the mundane world, there were always bargains to be found. However, Chen Ping'an was still keen to speak about the righteousness of the martial world.

Speaking of righteousness required spending money.

These talismans required Chen Ping'an to expend a considerable amount of Water Palace spiritual energy. Yet there were gains and losses; what he lost was a portion of the Water Palace's reserves, while what he gained was the potential to gradually open up a small realm of the Water Palace, forming a hidden vein in rivers and lakes. As a result, those young green-robed children had no objections to his drawing of talismans and supported him wholeheartedly.

On the path of cultivation, how one viewed gains and losses was a question of the Dao.

As for balancing those gains and losses, it required Chen Ping'an to continually draw talismans over time, constantly exploring and honing his skills. Fortunately, those little green-robed children from the Water Palace also provided reminders.

Dressed in a black robe and holding a green bamboo staff, Chen Ping'an stepped out of the cabin and gazed around.

In the mundane royal dynasty, there were homes nestled in the depths of the white clouds. Among the mountains, there were immortal sects, indeed, cities above the clouds.

Beyond the city, there was a small bustling market town illuminated by lights.

Yungshang City was a place of cultivation, heavily guarded, and rarely allowed outsiders in. It seemed that the local environment nurtured its own people. Similar to the Caique Palace within the jurisdiction of the Water Cloud Kingdom, Yungshang City also produced a robe known as the Cloud-Soaring Robe, though its quantity and quality were vastly inferior to that of the Caique Palace, with little fame and mediocre business. Most customers were lower-level practitioners from nearby mountains, especially those wild cultivators who weighed their coin purses carefully before purchasing a single piece.

Perhaps it was due to the sect’s limited financial resources that the Packing Room market had emerged.

It wasn’t just the shops without legs; even those with stalls needed to pay a fee to Yungshang City.

The ferry came to a stop, fifty zhang away from the sea of clouds, unable to approach any closer.

Otherwise, if the bow accidentally collided with the sea of clouds, or if they got too close and the vessel brushed against the sea, it could lead to catastrophic damage to Yungshang City’s foundational structure.

Therefore, those disembarking rode upon clouds and rode magical beasts, as they pleased.

For pure martial artists below the Golden Body stage, crossing this fifty zhang distance wasn't an easy feat.

Chen Ping'an took a deep breath, stepped back a few paces, then leaped high, landing on the ferry’s railing, using its leverage to soar into the air. After gracefully touching down, he swayed a few times before standing firm.

On this ferry belonging to a subordinate sect of the Dragon Palace, a woman with a delicate face and her friend extended their hands, smiling as they said, “Hand it over.”

The two were wagering whether this young sword wielder boarding from the Caique Palace was a mountain sword cultivator or a martial rogue from the rivers and lakes. The ferry woman guessed he was a pure martial artist traveling with a sword, while the old practitioner observing the sea speculated he was a concealed young sword cultivator.

The old practitioner shook his head and said, “What if this person is just deliberately putting on a show?”

This was just stubbornness; it was clear he intended to renege on the payment.

The woman scoffed, “Our continent's young sword cultivators, which of them isn’t a cultivator of the Cave Dwelling realm, with the aura of an Earth Immortal and the demeanor of someone from the Upper Five Realms? Can you find one like that?”

The old practitioner replied earnestly, “The world is vast; it’s not unusual for someone to be modest, concealing their brilliance, and act with caution.”

The woman in charge angrily said, “Enough with your nonsense! Pay up! Just a tiny Summer Solstice coin!”

The old practitioner sighed, pulling out a divine money coin and slapping it heavily into the woman’s palm before soaring off toward Yungshang City. He had decided to disembark here to buy a better-quality Cloud-Soaring Robe for his direct disciple. After all, the women at the Caique Palace were exceedingly shrewd in their dealings, offering good products at outrageously high prices. The old practitioner had to settle for less and had previously made a deposit with the workshop in Yungshang City to create a robe tailored to his specifications, complete with cloud runes and possibly some celestial materials to enhance its effects. Afterward, he would need to work hard at the foot of the mountain, earning a meager living from various sources. It took him decades of diligent savings to finally gather enough divine money just as his proud disciple was about to enter the Cave Dwelling realm. 

Especially considering he had a small mountain to manage, like a head of the family, where every grain and every expense was a worry.

The woman was just about to express her delight when she suddenly noticed that the divine money coin in her palm felt wrong—the weight and spiritual energy didn’t match that of a Summer Solstice coin. Looking down, she jumped up in anger.

It turned out to be just a Snowflake coin.

However, the old practitioner had already used his full strength and quickly flew past the market, heading straight for Yungshang City.

After she finished cursing, her mood lightened a bit, and she smiled again. Being able to pluck a feather from the notoriously stingy old man was still quite an achievement, even if it was just a single Snowflake coin.

She was a Golden Core practitioner, not just a ferry. The Golden Core management was already sufficient.

What’s more, the Golden Core practitioners from the Dragon Palace’s cave heaven could very well be treated as Nascent Soul practitioners based purely on their status.

Aside from her own sect, she had connections with the Yuyuan Dynasty’s Yungxia Palace and the Floating Pulp Sword Lake.

For mountain practitioners, being able to earn money still meant a significant trading relationship, which was more reliable than the relationships between rulers and subjects or between spouses down the mountain.

And that old practitioner who had known her early on had a bleak future, already showing signs of aging in the Sea Observation realm.

It was worth noting that this person had once been far from the stingy stereotype, being quite suave and charismatic in their youth.

However, over a hundred years of time had seemingly worn everything away.

He was no longer the youthful and handsome figure he once was, nor did he possess the same spirit, becoming an old practitioner who spent years socializing in the mansions of the powerful down the mountain and seeking treasures in the rivers and lakes.

Yet she still liked him.

Whether she liked the man from back then or the old man now was something she herself couldn’t quite define.

Chen Ping'an entered the market, finding a spot on a bustling street full of passersby. He opened his pack to set up his stall, revealing a large piece of blue cotton cloth he had prepared.

Surrounding him were fellow cultivators; some were loudly hawking their wares, while others were waiting for customers, some yawning in indifference.

Soon, two young men and women dressed in white robes approached to collect fees—one Snowflake coin per day.

Chen Ping'an asked if it would be half price if he stayed for four or five hours.

The young male cultivator smiled and shook his head, saying it started at one Snowflake coin.

Chen Ping'an didn't say much more and handed over a Snowflake coin. The same pricing applied at the Bone Beach, where dark tea was sold.

He asked a few more questions about renting or purchasing a shop in Yungshang City and received friendly responses from the young male cultivator, who explained the various price differences based on shop grades.

In the end, this foreign Packing Room merchant, who had come down from the ferry to try his luck, merely thanked them and didn’t pursue the shop matters further. The young male cultivator remained unfazed, even wishing this young wild cultivator a prosperous opening.

Chen Ping'an squatted down, starting to arrange his goods. Among them were a hardbound yellow book of divine images, a stock of "big demons" from the Bone Beach's summer retreat, and a few items from the underwater Dragon Palace of the Cangjun Lake—around twenty items in total, all of which were far from being quality treasures. However, more importantly, there were those talismans, five types neatly arranged like an army on the opened blue cloth.

Chen Ping'an looked up to see the pair of young men and women from Yungshang City walking side by side down the street, gradually fading into the distance.

The young man seemed to be in charge of the market, greeting shopkeepers and many Packing Rooms he knew.

The young woman said little, mostly watching the man beside her.

Her eyes spoke of silent conversations.

Chen Ping'an, with his hands in his sleeves, quietly observed this scene.

The scenery was absolutely beautiful.

The street was filled with tourists, all practitioners. Compared to the mundane folk visiting temple fairs and stalls, they were much quieter, with better patience. Most had already visited numerous Packing Rooms before but would rarely ask about prices, moving slowly. Occasionally, they would stop to examine an item that caught their eye, and after some consideration, they would quietly walk away, or some might attempt to haggle, often starting with a sharp cut in price. The more amiable stall owners would calmly recount the history of the spirit artifact, explaining its significance, while the less friendly ones simply ignored them, shrugging off the presence of those they deemed blind and poor.

Chen Ping'an soon encountered his first customer—an old man holding a child’s hand. He squatted down, glancing at the various items on the blue cloth, finally settling his gaze on a row of talismans made of yellow paper.

The old man stared intently at the five talismans.

The talisman paper was quite ordinary, but the quality of the talismans and their drawing techniques varied.

Different talismans had different values.

The old man quickly came up with an estimate in his mind and felt he had to negotiate.

To his surprise, he had only brought his grandchild out for a casual evening stroll, yet here he was with unexpected gains.

The old man pointed at a lightning talisman, smiling as he asked, “Shopkeeper, how much for this lightning talisman if I buy just one?”

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, “One lightning talisman is eleven Snowflake coins, but if you buy all ten, it’s one hundred Snowflake coins. However, I don’t negotiate prices at this stall.”

The old man nodded and smiled, saying, “These are good talismans, but the paper quality is somewhat lacking, unable to fully harness the power of the lightning talisman. That’s quite a discount, and the price is a bit high.”

Chen Ping'an smiled without saying a word.

This person was at least half an expert.

Thus, he didn’t need to say any more.

The old man then inquired about the prices of the earth and water talismans, which were roughly similar, with each talisman differing by only a Snowflake coin or two.

The lightning talisman was the most expensive, as lightning techniques were renowned as the foundation of all techniques in the world, and the Longhu Mountain Tianshi Mansion’s very foundation was rooted in the “authentic lightning techniques.”

However, according to Qi Jinglong, this Thunder Department Talisman could only fetch a decent price if drawn on yellow paper from the Huang Seal. Otherwise, drawn on ordinary merchant's yellow paper, its power would be too average, and even ordinary Golden Core cultivators might not take it seriously.

In response, Chen Ping'an quipped, “You, Qi Jinglong, think these talismans are exceptional; do I still need to hawk them as a Packing Room merchant?”

The old man’s gaze shifted as he asked, “If I’m not mistaken, these two are barrier-breaking talismans?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, saying, “These were taught by a master, a secret not to be shared, unique in the world. I struggled for years before finally learning how to draw these talismans, but I can only assure a success rate of about fifty to sixty percent. If I sell them cheaply, I would be disrespecting that esteemed senior.”

The old man looked up at the young stall owner dressed in black robes and bearing a long sword, hesitating for a moment before asking, “Can you tell me the names of these two talismans?”

Chen Ping'an was relieved.

This was someone who truly knew their goods.

He countered, “The names of talismans often align with their true meanings and can reveal secrets of the heavens. May I ask, sir, when martial artists clash in the rivers and lakes, do they announce the names of their martial arts moves?”

The old man laughed, “Of course not.”

Chen Ping'an continued, “If you buy the talismans, even if it’s just one of each, I’m willing to reveal the names of these two secrets.”

The old man suppressed a laugh and shook his head, “Not only is it common for shops selling talismans to share some insights, but even your little Packing Room traveling the world would find it normal to sell good talismans while revealing a bit of their true essence.”

“Good things don’t worry about selling.”

After saying that, Chen Ping'an smiled and added, “However, given your discerning eye, I’ll make a deal: if you buy just one talisman, I’ll share the names of both.”

The child beside the old man widened his eyes. 

Goodness, this fellow was quite thick-skinned.

The old man actually nodded, “Alright, I’ll take that talisman.”

He pointed at the Sword Qi Bridge Talisman.

Chen Ping'an asked with a smile, “Aren’t you going to ask the price first?”

The old man replied, “In business, a good start is essential. I see that you’ve just opened your stall, and I am your first customer, so even for good luck, you should give me a discount.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “The original price was fifteen Snowflake coins. For this good fortune, I’ll sell it to you for ten.”

The Sword Qi Bridge Talisman, if its true essence could be converted into divine money, would certainly be worth much more than the Thunder Department Talisman, the Great River Flowing Talisman, and the Earth Binding Talisman.

However, in the realm of mountain techniques and treasures, offensive talismans were always priced higher than defensive ones, and barrier-breaking talismans were generally considered entry-level, making it difficult to raise prices. It relied on thin margins for mass sales.

Usually, wild practitioners from the mountains needed offensive talismans more, while scholars of talismans were more willing to pay for barrier-breaking talismans since the latter had a larger customer base and higher consumption.

The old man reached into his sleeve for a coin pouch and pulled out ten Snowflake coins, handing them over.

Once Chen Ping'an accepted the coins and was about to casually pick up a talisman, he was taken aback when the old man smiled and grabbed one for himself, tucking it into his sleeve.

What a sharp eye.

It was the most spiritually resonant one among the talismans he drew, being the last talisman he had completed.

Chen Ping'an caught a glimpse of the street behind and, using his increasingly adept heart lake ripples, subtly informed the old man, “The talisman you bought is called the Sword Qi Bridge Talisman. It contains sword intent and is quite rare. Not only does it break through geographical barriers, but it also exudes an intangible deterrent. As for the other barrier-breaking talismans, they are… ‘Road Guidance Talismans’.”

When he mentioned the second talisman, he intentionally omitted the words “Bai Ze,” as Qi Jinglong had always referred to it that way, emphasizing respect. He had written the two characters himself.

This was a trivial matter.

For mountain practitioners, it was common knowledge that Bai Ze had long been suppressed by the Confucian sages in one of the nine great towers of the Haoran realm. Even shouting “Bai Ze” a thousand times a day or cursing it wouldn’t be considered a taboo, unlike directly calling the names of great Confucian saints.

However, the fact that Chen Ping'an could become friends with Qi Jinglong spoke volumes about their shared understanding of such “trivial matters,” which were rooted in mutual respect and shared customs.

Chen Ping'an used his hand to write the five characters for the Bai Ze Road Guidance Talismans in the air.

After the old man saw it, he nodded, “The shopkeeper is honorable for not deceiving me. Therefore, I plan to buy another Road Guidance Talisman.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “The original price was fifteen Snowflake coins, but since this is a transaction with you, I’ll still charge ten.”

The old man didn’t hesitate and handed over ten Snowflake coins.

The child tugged at his grandfather's sleeve, whispering, “Ten Snowflake coins for a barrier-breaking talisman is still expensive.”

The old man smiled, “Although earning money is difficult, Snowflake coins are common. Good talismans are hard to come by. These two barrier-breaking talismans are worth collecting, making it a fortunate transaction.”

Chen Ping'an sincerely complimented, “Your insight is commendable.”

He then smoothly transitioned the conversation, “So, old sir, why not take all ten of these lightning talismans? It would be fortunate for them to meet someone of your caliber; they wouldn’t be wasted.”

Despite the child’s good upbringing, he couldn’t help but roll his eyes.

The old man pondered for a moment and said with a smile, “In that case, along with the barrier-breaking talismans, I’ll take five of each of the other types. The two barrier-breaking talismans are good, and I’m indeed tempted. So, at fifteen Snowflake coins each for those, I won’t haggle. That’s one hundred and fifty Snowflake coins. As for the remaining lightning, water, and earth talismans, which aren’t the best, I’m only willing to pay a total of one hundred and twenty for those.”

Chen Ping'an frowned, “If we average that out, that’s only eight Snowflake coins for each talisman?”

The old man replied, “Shopkeeper, considering I’m buying twenty-seven talismans in one go, that’s no small purchase. Everyone on this street can see it; I’m helping draw in customers for your stall. Isn’t that a fair statement?”

Chen Ping'an stood his ground, “No, I suspect that most of the customers on the street have already deduced that you and I are in cahoots, so there’s no real customer-drawing involved. It might even create a bad impression that could hamper my business. Honestly speaking, I’m just being sincere here.”

The child was wide-eyed, witnessing this exchange.

The old man laughed heartily, “Alright, I’ll add ten more Snowflake coins for the remaining three talismans.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “With such great insight, you should have the stylish demeanor of a good merchant to match your standing!”

The old man straightened his face and shook his head, “If you keep bullying an honest person like me, I might just walk away without buying a single talisman.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Alright, alright, to celebrate a smooth opening, you’re honorable, and this little Packing Room, I can’t afford to act tough. For the sake of good fortune, I won’t charge you the extra ten Snowflake coins; for twenty-five talismans, I’ll only take two hundred and seventy Snowflake coins!”

The child didn’t think the young stall owner was generous at all. He raised his little hands, moved his fingers, and quickly calculated the price in his mind, wary that the stall owner might be trying to cheat them.

Fortunately, the price checked out.

The child put his hands away, still feeling it was too expensive, but since his grandfather liked it, he didn’t help haggle.

Otherwise, he would have been scared to negotiate himself.

The old man dug out three Summer Solstice coins along with the additional thirty Snowflake coins, bargaining with the young stall owner for a beautifully crafted hardbound divine image book and a small tea cake from the Xuanbi.

The old man then selected five of each type from the five rows of talismans.

Chen Ping'an allowed the old man to take his pick.

However, the old man’s choices surprised Chen Ping'an. With a ripple of heart lake, he softly asked, “Given your discerning eye, why not select those talismans of better quality instead of opting for the less impressive ones?”

The old man seemed quite puzzled and laughed, “Shopkeeper, your business sense is quite extraordinary.”

Chen Ping'an chose not to elaborate further.

This was where the conversation ended, and no more needed to be said.

The world is full of wonders, yet people remain the hardest to comprehend.

Once the old man left, others began to arrive.

Chen Ping'an's stall quickly became bustling.

Customers came and went, but no one was truly willing to spend money just yet.

The old man with the child drifted off into the crowd.

Chen Ping'an, with his hands tucked into his sleeves, squatted in place, rubbing the Snowflake coin he collected in his palm, which bore the engravings of “Always Envy the Jade Carver of the Mortal Realm” and “Su Zi’s Poems Resemble Paintings” on both sides.

Snowflake coins had their own unique charms, with various engravings throughout the continent. However, a coin with seven ancient characters like this one was exceptionally rare.

Besides earning an unexpected three Summer Solstice coins, Chen Ping'an was also delighted to add a newly minted Snowflake coin to his collection.

Moreover, three Summer Solstice coins had a premium value when converted to Snowflake coins, making it a small profit.

Initially, Chen Ping'an had estimated the value of all the talismans he was selling at half their actual worth.

This journey to Yungshang City had proved fruitful for his Packing Room.

Typically, any shop at a ferry in the celestial realm could sell talismans made of yellow paper for one Snowflake coin each, so his pricing was already considered high.

He hadn’t expected to earn three Summer Solstice coins unexpectedly, as they simply flew into his pocket.

Everything is difficult at the beginning.

With a generous old man serving as a good omen, he then sold two more lightning talismans.

The water and earth talismans, as well as the barrier-breaking ones, had yet to find a buyer; many customers were put off just by hearing the prices.

One rugged-looking man bought an item from the Cangjun Lake Dragon Palace, which was heavily scented and seemed aimed at impressing a woman or for offering to certain female cultivators. Upon hearing the price of five Snowflake coins, he cursed under his breath but ultimately paid up.

He pointed at the imposing Thunder Department Talisman and asked for its price.

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, “Two ‘damns’ and two extra Snowflake coins.”

The man scoffed, “Are you slaughtering pigs or what?!”

Even someone with Chen Ping'an's audacity found himself momentarily speechless.

Nearby onlookers burst into laughter.

The man realized he had misspoken and cursed himself instead; it seemed illogical to argue. He scratched his head, caught between desire and a tight purse. He genuinely needed to buy a lightning talisman to deal with a major demon occupying a mountain. If it worked out well, he would reap substantial rewards; if it failed, he would suffer greatly. Twelve Snowflake coins were indeed a significant burden. In the end, he couldn’t bring himself to pay and left in frustration.

Chen Ping'an didn’t try to stop him.

After the man walked a distance, he couldn’t help but glance back, seeing the young stall owner smile at him. The man felt even more disheartened and strode off, trying not to dwell on it.

Chen Ping'an continued his business.

This was a relief as the prices for the talismans and all other items were fixed.

Having earned three Summer Solstice coins, his Packing Room felt much lighter.

He planned to continue as a Packing Room in the same spot, but upon entering his cabin, he immediately focused on drawing talismans.

There was no time for idleness in cultivation!

However, after drawing over ten talismans, the Water Palace stirred.

Chen Ping'an had to set his brush down.

The ferry was about to officially set sail, and there was something in Yungshang City that couldn’t be missed.

As long as the ferry docked at the sea of clouds, Yungshang City would be bustling, likely allowing them to earn some scattered divine money.

Chen Ping'an stepped out of the cabin, watching as several Yungshang City practitioners boarded three ordinary spirit boats. Over the special sea of clouds, they cast large nets to catch a type of fish that enjoyed pecking at clouds.

Of course, the flying fish could also be sold for money.

Chen Ping'an leaned against the railing, admiring the picturesque scene.

It resembled a fisherman casting nets, yet this was a sea of clouds.

Afterward, they left the boundaries of the Water Cloud Kingdom, coming to the narrow water region of the Beiting Kingdom, passing by a mountain dedicated to wishes where no temple or monastery existed.

In the mortal realm, when there are prayers, there are also offerings.

Many who originally burned incense might be thousands of miles away from home. Many devout elderly, having aged or fallen ill, unable to travel far, would entrust their younger family members to make a not-too-distant journey to the Wish Fulfillment Mountain to burn incense in reverence to the gods.

In the Northern Julu, there were several such Wish Fulfillment Mountains.

In contrast, the Baoping and Tongye Continents had no such examples.

Chen Ping'an, not being foolish, didn’t go to the Wish Fulfillment Mountain to burn incense. He neither made wishes nor offered thanks; he simply paid his respects to the mountain.

Behind the Wish Fulfillment Mountain, there was a waterfall flowing in reverse.

Chen Ping'an watched for a long time, but couldn’t fathom its meaning.

In the deep pool, there was also a spring that gushed forth whenever sword wielders and knife users drew their weapons by the water, as if responding to their actions, shooting upward.

Of course, those who yelled at the top of their lungs could also cause the spring to erupt.

But it lacked the essence and wonder of a sword or knife being drawn, which created a miraculous scene akin to a “line of heaven” appearing out of nowhere.

While observing the reverse waterfall, Chen Ping'an also took note of the sprays of water that were shouted out.

Behind him, the sword immortal’s aura rippled slightly.

Chen Ping'an said in his heart, “Can we not be so childish? You should at least display the dignity of a divine weapon, right?”

Only then did the sword immortal quiet down.

Perhaps it was because the semi-divine weapon had been referred to as a divine weapon?

Chen Ping'an felt a bit worried; could the feng shui of the Falling Mountain truly be affected by him?

That reasoning made no sense.

How could he be compared to Pei Qian or Zhu Lian? And even closer, wasn’t Du Yu from the Ghost Craft Palace an expert in this field?

After paying his respects, viewing the reverse waterfall and the spring, Chen Ping'an returned to the ferry.

He hesitated about one thing.

Whether to disembark halfway and actively seek treasures for the first time in his life.

Earlier on the ferry, some practitioners had whispered about a newly discovered cave dwelling in the Beiting Kingdom. Yet those practitioners felt there was no need to go, as there were many powerful figures from Yungshang City, Caique Palace, and several kingdoms in Beiting, along with many well-informed wild cultivators, who would have set out early. In their discussions, they highlighted how the wild, desperate mountain cultivators were the ones to fear the most; they would risk their lives for wealth, and any conflict could lead to fatal outcomes—not worth the risk.

Moreover, such openly publicized opportunities weren’t truly opportunities.

Chen Ping'an considered that the ferry route to the Dragon Palace was fixed, roughly once a month, and it would pass through Peach Blossom Ferry, Yungshang City, and the River God Ferry in Beiting. Thus, if he disembarked, he would likely delay his journey by a month.

Ultimately, at the River God Ferry, Chen Ping'an decided to disembark.

This journey, he thought, would be akin to the scholar from Lujiao County who went by the name of Lu Dun, seeking immortals and exploring the mysterious world.

A simple visit without the slightest competitive spirit, surprisingly, made Chen Ping'an a bit nervous, as he was used to not seeking outside help.

As for the exact route to the unnamed mountain, it wasn’t too difficult to find out.

There were practitioners to guide him.

He affixed a talisman from the Ghost Craft Palace’s secret travel scripts onto himself, and considering his injuries had nearly healed, though he wasn’t back to peak condition, he felt he could handle three punches from the old elder without dying.

Chen Ping'an concealed his figure, moving silently through the mountains and waters, as if he were Zhu Lian or Pei Qian, who would definitely praise him for his stealth.

That night, under the cover of darkness, Chen Ping'an rested on a high branch.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes, receiving a message from Liu Jinglong through a flying sword.

The contents of the message were still quite brief.

Just two sentences.

Gu You and Ji Yue are both dead.

Gu You drew an ancient Sword Sealing Talisman at his heart, sealing Ji Yue’s life sword for a moment, exchanging his life for another.

After feeding a divine money coin to the sword box, the message-carrying flying sword vanished in an instant.

Chen Ping'an cradled the back of his head and gazed into the distance where the flying sword had departed.

Once Qi Jinglong returned to the north, the journey would be longer, and it would be easy for the message-carrying flying sword to go forever.

So this was the last flying sword message before Qi Jinglong went into seclusion for a breakthrough.

Sitting on the tree branch, Chen Ping'an had somewhat anticipated these events, so he wasn't too heartbroken, but he did feel a sense of loss, leaving him staring blankly and abstaining from drinking. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 # Chapter 639: A Hidden Paradise

The trio traveled through the night, the gentle sound of a mountain stream flowing nearby, creating an ethereal and melodious atmosphere.

A tall, slender old Daoist, his eyes shining with wisdom, donned a flowing Daoist robe made of silk. The robe was relatively old-fashioned, adorned with intricate embroidery depicting the twelve months of the year. He carried a peach wood sword on his back and had a string of copper bells tied around his waist. Under the moonlight, the old man exuded an air of otherworldly grace.

Beside him walked a handsome young gentleman, dressed in white and carrying a short dagger with a golden sheath. The third member of their group was a scruffy man, burdened with a travel pack, who seemed to be the young master’s attendant.

Suddenly, the three paused. In the distance, by the stream, they could vaguely see someone sitting on a rocky ledge, seemingly engrossed in something under the moonlight.

The scruffy man glanced at the copper bells at the old Daoist’s waist but remained silent. The three of them felt a slight relief.

The bells were a rare spiritual artifact known as the Pagoda Bell, originally hung under the eaves of an ancient temple in the Great Source Dynasty. Later, the emperor of the Great Source Dynasty expanded the scale of the Chao Xuan Bureau, demolishing several grand halls of the ancient temple. During this period, the Pagoda Bell was lost to the people, changing hands several times before finally disappearing from public view. It was only by chance that the current owner found it on a white skeleton in a cave deep in the mountains, along with the remains of a giant python, earning a substantial profit of two hundred snowflake coins, while the Pagoda Bell remained with him.

It wasn’t about the lack of buyers for a high price; rather, it was a reluctance to part with something truly valuable, which always has a price but no market. The bell had been meticulously recorded by Yu Yuan, the owner of the Heartfelt Studio, in his book *Silent Collection*. However, in the catalog, the Pagoda Bell was listed rather low on the list. But any bell recorded in that catalog never lacked buyers.

With this bell in hand, cultivators could traverse mountains and rivers without needing various essential talismans such as barrier-breaking talismans, spirit-warding talismans, or heart-purifying talismans. While these talismans were noticeably useful for one or two trips into the mountains or waters, the costs could add up significantly over time, becoming a hefty expense. Moreover, with the bell in hand, it could be sold at any time; any ferry or immortal shop would be willing to pay a fortune, ideally selling directly to the Heartfelt Studio, to the discerning Yu Yuan.

The Buddhist bell symbolizes three meanings: awakening, joy, and preaching. This was, of course, a vague interpretation; for cultivators, the most crucial effect of the Pagoda Bell was its connection to "awakening." Whenever a demon or ghost approached, the bell would sound by itself. The more malevolent and powerful the creature, the more urgent and thunderous the bell's chime. Even the spirits and demons below the Dragon Gate realm could not withstand the warning of this bell. Additionally, it could be used to break barriers, allowing cultivators to see through and remain unconfused by the various illusions and misdirections one might encounter.

The young gentleman communicated with his companions through thought: "All three of us are skilled in close combat, but we lack someone with offensive skills and treasures. Why don’t we take a chance?"

The tall, old Daoist agreed, realizing it was a feasible idea. His seemingly ornate robe and the peach wood sword on his back were merely facades. In truth, he was a wild cultivator who had spent over a decade in a small local Daoist temple. His greatest regret in life was not having learned any authentic Daoist techniques during his time there, but rather, failing to purchase a Daoist lineage status through the temple's connection with the court. By seniority, he should have been able to buy a status, but unexpectedly, his master secretly sold the quota to a wealthy scion of a noble family. After promising to let him wait three more years, the master passed away, leaving the position to another affluent junior. Enraged, he left the temple, taking with him the temple's treasured manual, a secret book that no one had been able to decipher.

The scruffy man felt uneasy, knowing that the fellow could be anyone, and randomly adding a mysterious person to their group could easily lead to trouble.

The young gentleman laughed, "Let’s take it step by step. If it works out, that’s great; if not, we don’t lose anything. Plus, if we later split the spoils, three against one might yield us some extra wealth. Wouldn't you agree?"

The tall, old Daoist stroked his beard and smiled. The scruffy man finally nodded in agreement.

The young gentleman grinned. "Let me test the waters first. Brother Sun and Brother Huang, please wait here."

As the young man stepped forward, he advanced a few steps. The figure in black robes sitting with their back to the three still showed no signs of movement.

When the young man slightly increased his pace and advanced another ten steps, the figure in black suddenly turned around, standing up to fix a piercing gaze on the seemingly affluent young man.

The young man halted, smiling as he introduced himself, "I am Qin Juyuan, a citizen of Jiayou Country. The two friends behind me include Brother Sun, who has trained at the Thunder God’s residence on Infant Mountain, under one of the masters, the revered Jingming Zhenren! Unfortunately, Brother Sun is still a registered disciple and hasn’t yet entered the master’s hall for the lineage status. Brother Sun has traveled far, slaying demons and eliminating evils, accumulating considerable merit. After a joint demon-hunting venture, we became close friends, and upon hearing of an ancient cave appearing in the mountains of Beiting Country, we wished to explore it together for any fortuitous opportunities."

The figure in black was an elderly man, hands hidden in his sleeves, with faint ripples emanating from them. He was evidently wary of the unexpected visitors in the mountains.

The black-robed elder squinted and asked, "The Thunder God’s residence on Infant Mountain? How coincidental—I just heard of it. It is said that the unique lightning talismans from Infant Mountain can summon thunder and rain, possessing immense power. Furthermore, I happen to have a secret talisman from the Thunder God’s residence."

The elder retrieved a talisman, intricately woven with lightning patterns, holding it high and sneering, "I wonder if this Brother Sun recognizes whether it’s the Day-Slayer Ghost-Restraining Talisman or the Pestilence-Repelling Temple Talisman?"

The young gentleman stood with his hands clasped behind him, one palm open and the other clenched into a fist, signaling his companions to gauge the situation.

As he pressed down on the hilt of his dagger, it indicated the possibility of a preemptive strike. However, that was the worst-case scenario. If the opponent's talisman was of exceptional quality, they might end up just passing each other by, maintaining a peaceful distance.

But in reality, both sides had already forged enmity.

The sect masters on the mountain naturally had no need for such caution. This young swordsman, though a scion of a fallen family, was not truly from Jiayou Country; his real name was Di Yuanfeng. He had learned swordsmanship from a family of frontier soldiers, and the dagger he carried was a treasured heirloom. While he had not been in the Jianghu for long, he had already experienced the schemes of wild cultivators twice. Once with the rough-looking "Brother Huang," and the second time, he had allied with "Brother Sun."

The tall, old Daoist stepped forward a few steps and casually glanced at the talisman in the black-robed cultivator's hand, smiling, "There’s no need for such probing, my friend. The talisman you hold is undoubtedly a lightning talisman, but it is certainly not from our Thunder God’s residence; our talismans from Infant Mountain are unique, born from an ancient well where heaven and earth converge, nurturing a pool of thunder and lightning energy. The talismans crafted from this essence have a distinct reddish hue, unlike any other talisman. Furthermore, the five ancestral talismans of the Thunder God’s residence contain a secret that you clearly haven’t grasped yet. It is truly regrettable. If there’s an opportunity in the future, you may return to Infant Mountain with me, and you’ll understand its mysteries."

The black-robed elder nodded, stowing the talisman back into his sleeve, and offered a respectful bow. "I have met Brother Sun."

The young gentleman let out a sigh of relief.

Damn, these wild cultivators are as slippery as they come. They really are hard to deal with.

The tall, old Daoist was, of course, not a Daoist from the Thunder God’s residence, which was a powerful sect guarded by two Nascent Soul ancestors, one of the top-tier places in the land. It was unlikely for the surname Sun to have such good fortune to become a disciple of one of the five great masters of Infant Mountain. Although Jingming Zhenren was the last Golden Core Earth Immortal of the Thunder God’s residence, he was still revered in the eyes of the wild cultivators below.

Fortunately, since the surname Sun dared to masquerade as a wandering cultivator, he did have some understanding of the Thunder God’s residence’s talismans.

But if the other party produced a secret talisman from the ancestral hall, the surname Sun would certainly be left dumbfounded, as he only had hearsay from others. The five talismans had great significance, but what exactly they entailed was something Brother Sun had no right to know. Fortunately, even if the other party delved into the details, Brother Sun would not need to respond, for if he truly were a lineage master, how could he casually divulge the secrets of his own ancestral hall?

Thus, Brother Sun's responses were reasonable, demonstrating empathy. Even the young gentleman began to shed most of his doubts.

At that moment, the black-robed elder suddenly spoke without warning, "The divine general’s iron chains settle the mountains."

The tall, old Daoist laughed heartily, "The Five Thunder Commandments emerge from the Scarlet Palace!"

The elder visibly relaxed and bowed again, "I was rude; I apologize to Brother Sun for my previous behavior."

The black-robed elder clearly showed little interest in the young man and the scruffy man.

Di Yuanfeng felt a wave of resentment; indeed, the title of a lineage master from the Thunder God’s residence was effective everywhere. During their travels, on several occasions, he and the others had enjoyed the hospitality of lesser sects and small kingdoms simply by being associated with him.

The elder seemed to want to step down from the rocky ledge to treat the three with courtesy. Halfway down, he suddenly asked, "Brother Sun, why do you not wear the Daoist robe of the Thunder God’s residence while traveling down the mountain?"

Di Yuanfeng's temper flared. Was this ever going to end?!

He was on the verge of reaching for the dagger again.

This cautious old man certainly had a lot of variables in their alliance; at the very least, it wouldn’t be easy to just take down the three of them.

The tall, old Daoist stroked his beard and smiled, shaking his head, "Wearing the robes of the mountain would only draw unnecessary attention. Do you mean to say that the journey of cultivation should take place at a banquet?"

The black-robed elder smiled slightly and finally descended from the rocky ledge, sighing, "Brother Sun is indeed a high-minded person from Infant Mountain. This refreshing detachment from worldly riches is truly admirable. I trust that upon returning to the Thunder God’s ancestral mountain, you will surely advance further and become a direct disciple of Jingming Zhenren and the ancestral hall."

At that moment, the old fox, once seen only as a wild cultivator in the eyes of the trio, now bore a hint of reverence. Yet, his gaze remained fixed solely on Brother Sun, smiling, "I am Chen, from the impoverished Wuling Country, my Daoist cultivation is quite shallow, and my sect is not worth mentioning, merely a source of regret. I have only learned a bit of talisman writing, a trivial skill that hardly deserves any admiration. I certainly wouldn’t dare to showcase it before a master like Brother Sun. My earlier probing was merely a foolish act, and I am deeply embarrassed. I hope Brother Sun can forgive me."

Brother Sun smiled, "When traveling, caution is always wise. There’s no need for you to feel guilty, Brother Chen."

Brother Sun took the lead towards the black-robed elder, with Di Yuanfeng and the scruffy man naturally following behind.

In fact, among the three, Di Yuanfeng was originally considered the leader, so when it came to sharing the spoils, he could take 40%, while the other two would each take 30%.

The black-robed elder stepped aside to let Brother Sun "ascend the mountain." As soon as he did, Di Yuanfeng inserted himself, following closely behind Brother Sun, showing no deference to Di Yuanfeng and the scruffy man.

Di Yuanfeng and the scruffy man exchanged a quick smile. This behavior was very much in line with that of a wild cultivator.

After being cautious, they adapted to the situation seamlessly. This must be a fellow cultivator.

Good fortune.

The four of them sat together on the rocky ledge.

Brother Sun asked with a smile, "Are you also here for the cave in the mountains?"

The black-robed elder, who carried a blue cloth bag, had apparently deemed Brother Sun to be a master from Infant Mountain. After three rounds of probing, he no longer harbored doubts and revealed a hint of helplessness, speaking frankly, "Of course. However, I haven’t obtained the local government’s geomantic map, and I’ve been wandering here for quite some time. Otherwise, I would already be over a hundred miles deep in the mountains. With better luck, I could have found the cave’s entrance, which has already been opened."

Brother Sun glanced at Di Yuanfeng, who wore bamboo-staff sandals. The latter smiled slightly, retrieving a neatly folded county map, a copy of the terrain.

Geomantic maps have always been taboo in the courts of various countries, never to be leaked. The fact that Di Yuanfeng and the other two were able to copy it was undoubtedly due to Brother Sun's status. However, the local magistrate was no fool and had forced Brother Sun to display some of his Daoist arts and a dozen talismans that could be posted in the government office.

The tall, old Daoist was not skilled at drawing talismans; he had only seen a few entry-level talismans from Infant Mountain and had drawn them with about 70-80% accuracy. The secret manual he had stolen from the temple contained no talisman records. However, the talismans he drew did possess a hint of spiritual energy, enough to ward off the not-so-strong evil spirits in the marketplace.

These talismans would not actually be posted on the government’s main door but sold by the magistrate to those local nobles who were wealthy and feared for their lives.

The black-robed elder thanked him and took the map, studying it closely. "As expected of Brother Sun; you can accurately copy such a thing."

The tall, old Daoist stroked his beard and smiled, saying nothing.

The scruffy man, introducing himself as Huang Shi, fell silent again.

The black-robed elder hesitated to speak. Di Yuanfeng realized that this person had finally taken the bait.

Unfortunately, neither he nor Brother Sun had spoken a word. The other party needed to show some sincerity and investment first.

This "tension" black-robed elder was none other than Chen Pingan, hidden behind a facade.

With a weary face, carrying a long sword and slung with a bag, he looked dispirited, his eyes murky.

The supposed registered disciple of the Thunder God’s residence was something Chen Pingan had never believed from the start. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been probing the other party’s identity with such shallow tactics.

After all, Infant Mountain was an important mountain gate on the western side of the Great Source Dynasty, and he had learned about it before coming to North Julu Continent, later inquiring in detail with Qi Jinglong about the Thunder God’s residence’s talismans.

Although Qi Jinglong was from the Taihui Sword Sect, his talismanic arts were widely known throughout the continent. 

Chen Pingan even learned that the key to the five talismans of the Thunder God’s residence was to use five ancestral seals, each representing a different title: "Great General of the Jade Court," "Five Directions Inspectors," and "Direct Hall Grand Advisor." Additionally, Qi Jinglong had personally drawn talismans to demonstrate the five thunder techniques, whose power, while not comparable to that of a true Earth Immortal from the Thunder God’s residence, still held significant worth. Chen Pingan believed that aside from the five masters holding the seals, no one from Infant Mountain could match Qi Jinglong’s understanding of talismans.

People can be infuriating.

Moreover, anger was of no use.

The reason he deliberately pretended to believe the other party's identity was because Chen Pingan hoped to use the three of them to create an extra layer of concealment for himself, rather than going to explore the cave alone.

As for how to deal with wild cultivators, Chen Pingan had some experience from his interactions with Liu Lao Cheng and Liu Zhi Mao.

Although each continent had its own customs and manners, wild cultivators were still just wild cultivators.

White wine for red faces, gold for black hearts. 

Traveling thousands of miles for wealth, leading with profit.

After weighing the pros and cons, Chen Pingan cautiously asked, "Does Brother Sun need an extra hand?"

After some consideration, Brother Sun pretended to nod in agreement. He knew that "Qin Juyuan" would obstruct him.

As expected, without needing to communicate through thought, Di Yuanfeng asked, "Brother Chen, if it were you, would you casually add an unknown companion to the team?"

Chen Pingan gritted his teeth and hesitated, pulling out a stack of yellow paper talismans from his sleeve, categorizing them, and laying them out one by one. In addition to the Heavenly Department’s Thunder Command talisman, there were also two River Crossing Talismans and two Soil Gathering Talismans, along with several barrier-breaking talismans. They were all made with gold and silver powder, in stark contrast to the fifty talismans sold at the Cloud City’s shop, aside from the material being the most ordinary yellow paper, the rest—be it brushwork, quality, or power—were worlds apart, and the prices were incomparable.

The art of talisman-making followed many rules. Just the ink used to "dip" the brush varied from ordinary red sand, gold powder, silver powder, and even the expensive immortal-grade dan shan. Among them, immortal-grade dan shan was a bottomless pit.

Thus, for cultivators who practiced talismans, drawing talismans was akin to burning money. The more authentic the sect's talismans, the more they consumed celestial money. Fortunately, as soon as talisman cultivators entered the door, they could immediately earn money to support their sect. However, talisman sect cultivators were heavily reliant on talent; one could gauge their future prospects based on the weight of their brush during their youth. Of course, it wasn’t absolute; there were late bloomers who suddenly became enlightened, but they were often the wild cultivators abandoned early on by the lineage masters.

The talismans Chen Pingan had taken out were all made with yellow paper and gold thread, which, compared to secular red sand and silver powder talismans, were naturally of higher quality.

Brother Sun glanced at the talismans and then at the black-robed elder, who was merely smiling in silence.

Chen Pingan then awkwardly smiled, pulling out the first talisman he had drawn with precious dan shan from Chun Lu Mountain and gently placing it on the ground.

Di Yuanfeng asked with a smile, “Brother Chen, where did you buy these precious talismans? They look quite impressive; I’d like to purchase some for myself.”

The black-robed elder responded with a sense of pride, "Although I’m not a lineage master, and I have no teaching from a talisman master, I do have some talent in the art of talismans..."

Just as he was about to continue, the elder suddenly reined in his proud demeanor, looking somewhat dejected. "Of course, compared to Brother Sun, my skills are merely child’s play."

Brother Sun felt the timing was right and, with an indifferent expression, said, "Brother Chen, you shouldn’t belittle yourself. To be honest, although I have practiced in Infant Mountain for many years, you should know that among the true disciples of the five masters of the Thunder God’s residence, they can generally be divided into two types: those who focus on practicing the Five Thunder True Methods and those who specialize in talismans, hoping to receive a secret transmission of a direct talisman from the ancestral hall. I belong to the former. So if Brother Chen is indeed a master of talismans, we would actually be willing to invite you to visit the mountain with us."

The scruffy man, claiming to be Huang Shi, spoke up, "I wonder how powerful the talismans that Brother Chen painstakingly crafted are?"

Chen Pingan hesitated but then picked up a River Crossing Talismans, forming a hand sign as if reciting incantations. After a moment, he tossed it into the stream, calling out swiftly, weaving his hands in intricate gestures.

The talisman dissolved upon entering the water, but its spiritual light radiated outward, illuminating the stream as shimmering strands crisscrossed.

The three men watched as the black-robed elder spoke a command and, with his fingers together, gently said, "Rise." Then, with a flick of his hands, a stream dragon shot out of the stream, circling the rocky ledge before returning to the water at the elder’s direction. The elder clearly aimed to showcase his talisman skills, and he still had some strength left; the quality of his talismans was notably high, as there was still more to come since the shimmering strands in the stream remained.

The black-robed elder lifted his sleeves, and columns of water shot skyward, swirling around the four men rapidly. In an instant, mist enveloped them, the coolness seeping into their bones.

Di Yuanfeng communicated with Huang Shi through thought, who then used his martial prowess to respond, "There’s some skill there, but the offensive power is weak. These tricks look impressive but can be shattered with just a few punches. However, if this person can control all the talismans, they’d be a significant asset since we lack a cultivator capable of ranged attacks. Moreover, a talisman cultivator is most suitable for breaking barriers."

The black-robed elder retracted his talismanic power, and the stream returned to calm, with no more spiritual light condensing. The elder took a deep breath, and his face slightly flushed.

Brother Sun thought to the two men, "Even if he’s at the cave realm, he’s likely still hiding something from us. I can still affirm that this person is definitely not a deity from the Dragon Gate realm. So, we should regard him as a cave realm cultivator or a sea-watching realm cultivator who is neither too skilled nor too weak—just right for us without posing any danger. Apart from the talisman that he revealed earlier, he must have a few genuine good talismans hidden, so we should stay vigilant."

Huang Shi suddenly focused his thoughts and said to the two, "This person’s black robe might very well be a magical robe."

Di Yuanfeng laughed, "No hurry, let’s take our time and observe. We can draw our conclusions later."

Brother Sun said to Chen Pingan, "If this trip to the mountain goes smoothly, you can return to Infant Mountain with me, and I will try to introduce you a bit."

The black-robed elder was taken aback for a moment, then his eyes shone with excitement; his lips moved as if he couldn’t find words to express his emotions. 

For a wild cultivator, being able to join a sect like Infant Mountain, where a Nascent Soul cultivator presided, was akin to being reborn.

Di Yuanfeng took all this in, then smiled, "I wonder, Brother Chen, if you could elaborate on the effects of these talismans?"

Chen Pingan pointed to the talismans on the ground and explained their functions one by one. He said little about the barrier-breaking talisman, merely stating it was a unique bridge-crossing talisman he had learned. After all, there wasn’t much to elaborate on the ordinary barrier-breaking talismans, and he was too lazy to elaborate on the water talismans he had previously demonstrated. However, he detailed the offensive power of the lightning talismans and the soil talismans, naturally raising some suspicion of self-promotion in the ears of the three.

After discussing the two critical talismans, he displayed sincerity and intimidation. This was the manner of a wild cultivator, and the same principle applied to Di Yuanfeng’s earlier demonstration of the copied terrain map.

This was the foundation that a lineage master from the Thunder God’s residence should have.

After the four exchanged pleasantries, they began to set off.

Di Yuanfeng noticed the black-robed elder had moved closer to the tall, old Daoist. 

As they walked a little further behind, Di Yuanfeng lightly shook his head, while Huang Shi maintained a neutral expression but glanced at the black robe a few more times.

Chen Pingan quietly asked, "Brother Sun, we know about the ancient cave in North Beiting. Do you think the two immortal sects of Cloud City and Caique Prefecture might join forces to occupy it and drive away all outsiders, later splitting the spoils?"

Brother Sun smirked inwardly; after all, he was just a wild cultivator visiting from afar, not daring to get too close to the local government, which meant he missed many old stories.

According to the drunken words of the magistrate of the North Beiting County, he had heard from the court officials in the capital that the Earth Immortal Shen Zhenze of Cloud City and the beautiful master of Caique Prefecture had some old grievances. The two sects had long ceased their dealings, and this seemingly worthless rumor turned out to be the most valuable—perhaps even more so than the terrain map.

If Cloud City and Caique Prefecture, two local forces, joined forces to occupy the cave, there could be no opportunity for them wild cultivators to even scavenge. It would be a blessing just to leave unharmed, let alone discussing treasures and precious resources. If these two sects became enemies, it would present a tremendous opportunity. It was not uncommon for lineage masters to fight over treasures, with bloodshed becoming common, showing little regard for the consequences, as they would face the fallout without worry, being supported by their sects.

The tall, old Daoist smiled, "Regarding this matter, my friends can rest assured. If we do meet those two sect masters, I will make my identity clear; I believe Cloud City and Caique Prefecture would show some respect to me."

However, the old Daoist quickly reminded, "But if that happens, it would hinder my ability to seek opportunities genuinely. So even if I encounter those two sect masters, barring any major misunderstandings, I won’t reveal my identity."

The old Daoist naturally didn’t want to easily disclose any insider information to the black-robed elder.

However, the black-robed elder had clearly already accepted this, praising, "Brother Sun acts with such wisdom; your composure is commendable. As for me, a rootless wild cultivator, used to eating from the hands of various factions, I originally thought I had some experience, but compared to Brother Sun, I am far from it. I feel quite ashamed."

The tall, old Daoist stroked his beard and smiled. The other party clearly was not a truly sincere person, but he had spoken some honest words.

The North Beiting Country they were currently traversing was a minor nation, while the Fuhe Country was even weaker, with little to offer. The only notable feature was a fortunate female cultivator who had long left home, perhaps providing some care for her family. Moreover, given her current distinguished background and status, even if she had heard of the opportunities here, she would most likely not come to join the fray. A cave realm cultivator could break through the first barrier of this so-called immortal residence, and what treasures lay within were unlikely to be of good quality.

Many grand and earth-shattering caves or magical treasures had appeared. 

Even if Di Yuanfeng and his group received news, without a genuine lineage master status, they would not go to their death; the pride of a young noble was hardly trifling.

Years ago, the North Julu Continent had a widely circulated *Cautionary Collection*, which became immensely popular throughout the continent. However, it was later inexplicably banned and destroyed within a year. The Qionglin Sect, which had made a fortune off it, spearheaded the ban, ordering all shops at various immortal ferry crossings not to sell this book. 

It was speculated that this was a joint proposal by several great sword immortals, praised as "hands that do not touch money, shoulders that bear righteousness," with the Qionglin Sect leading the charge. From then on, the book was no longer printed. 

Di Yuanfeng had always thought fondly of this book.

He had only heard that it was written by a foreign cultivator named Jiang, whose writing was exquisite and filled with wisdom. 

For instance, Di Yuanfeng had heard Brother Sun mention a piece of advice from the book, which warned wild cultivators traveling that if they dared to seize opportunities in dangerous places, they should be particularly wary of those with disciples of immortal beings by their side. The younger they were, the more caution was needed, because once a conflict arose, the young man would undoubtedly unleash all his strength, using treasures to kill a cave realm wild cultivator with the force of killing a Golden Core Earth Immortal, not caring about the consumption of spiritual essence. As for the wild cultivators opposing them, they would naturally meet a swift demise, like flowers blooming.

At the same time, the *Cautionary Collection* also offered countermeasures; if one truly found themselves on the verge of death, they should never stubbornly make threats but should kneel and bow, not to plead with the man, but to seek mercy from the immortal woman beside him, ensuring the bowing was loud and the cries to the goddess were fervent. They might still have a glimmer of hope.

Even if Di Yuanfeng had only heard snippets of the *Cautionary Collection*, he believed this Jiang senior was truly insightful and possessed profound knowledge.

As he traveled along the mountain path with the three, Chen Pingan looked up at the sky, suddenly feeling a bit self-deprecating.

Compared to searching for opportunities alone, he seemed to prefer interacting with others. Even if it meant dealing with those who had ulterior motives, he had grown accustomed to it.

However, he had always felt a sense of awe and fear towards this vast world. From the first time he stepped out of the Lihua Cave Heaven, he had this mindset, and it remained unchanged even now.

Otherwise, with his current cultivation level and abilities, he wouldn’t feel the need to team up with others to explore the mountain, which would ease his mind a little.

This was not a good state of mind.

But it could only be improved gradually.

In fact, years ago, Lu Tai had seen through this and advised him earnestly.

He understood that some truths were easy to grasp but difficult to act upon. Among the countless people in the world, how many were like Chen Pingan?

Currently, besides following the Great Source, he was also preparing to walk the waters for Chen Lingjun, but his own cultivation could not be delayed. Achieving the Golden Body realm had long been an urgent matter for him.

In addition, he planned to save up some money to buy one or two imitation flying swords from Hate Sword Mountain.

At the Bone Shore, he had learned a lot from Yang Ningxing, who had transformed his evil thoughts into the embodiment of a scholar. He had even showcased a replica flying sword from Hate Sword Mountain, which had impressive momentum and was quite intimidating.

Even Chen Pingan, who was no stranger to flying swords, had been deceived back then.

As long as he successfully refined them on the first and fifteenth of the month, even if they were not his innate flying swords, they could be refined into a cultivator's innate items, equivalent to having two additional offensive magical treasures.

If he managed to acquire two more imitation flying swords from Hate Sword Mountain, during a battle, his enemies would face unexpected challenges, making it even harder to defend against.

The first flying sword would be from Hate Sword Mountain; the second would come out on the first day, and the third would appear on the fifteenth. 

Surely the opponents’ psychological state would be quite turbulent.

The Jianghu is treacherous, and the mountains are windy; such deceptions are most beneficial.

The winding path beneath them wound on for more than a hundred miles toward the cave.

At that moment, Huang Shi slowed his pace, followed by Di Yuanfeng, who pressed his hand against the hilt of his dagger.

Brother Sun also sensed something was off and fixed his gaze ahead, where a dilapidated mountain pavilion stood, overgrown with weeds, appearing quite out of place, with signs of trees being cut down.

Chen Pingan had sensed the anomaly at the pavilion first.

Only a lineage master would dare to light a fire in such an open manner at night, and they must have considerable influence.

A burly man stepped out from the pavilion, and Chen Pingan immediately recognized his identity.

It was Gao Ling, a military general from the Fuhe Country.

Previously, while fishing with the filling-sea immortal, the armored Gao Ling had boarded the ship with a fierce demeanor but had been pushed back onto the ship by Chen Pingan's palm.

Aside from Gao Ling, who wasn’t donning his Ganylu armor, there was also an unfamiliar martial artist, who seemed quite imposing.

Perhaps he was another Golden Body realm cultivator. 

Though it was uncertain whether he was a local master from North Beiting or a martial artist from the Fuhe Country, the latter was less likely, as the Fuhe Country was small and its customs seemed to value literature over martial arts, so their martial prowess was limited.

As for the woman who had once protected Gao Ling on board, she was undoubtedly a female cultivator. Later, during a chat at the tea house of the Caique Prefecture's Peach Blossom Ferry, Chen Pingan learned from the innkeeper that there was a young woman of noble descent in Fuhe Country, named Bai Bi, who had been taken in as a direct disciple by a sect from North Julu Continent at a young age. Estimating the time she had left home and considering her appearance and rough realm, the girl who had returned on the ship must have been the disciple under the leader of the Water Dragon Sect, Bai Bi.

Then Chen Pingan asked a rather awkward question, "Brother Sun, should we just walk past the pavilion?"

Brother Sun remained expressionless, calm and composed, saying nothing, giving off an air of an immortal.

However, Di Yuanfeng felt a headache coming on.

Turning back, Di Yuanfeng frowned slightly, while the scruffy man, Huang Shi, maintained his usual demeanor.

Chen Pingan understood.

It seemed that this venerable elder from the Thunder God’s residence, Brother Sun, still hadn’t figured out who among the three of them was the true recluse.

The scruffy Huang Shi’s breathing and footsteps indicated he was merely a pure martial artist of the fifth realm.

But this was something that Chen Pingan excelled at—identifying individuals who were intentionally holding back.

It was unfortunate that experience could sometimes reveal traces, and indeed, he seemed to be a Golden Body realm cultivator. 

If only this master were more approachable.

As for himself, Chen Pingan felt that as a third realm Qi cultivator, being approachable was not out of line.

Gao Ling and the other martial artist stepped out of the pavilion, standing firm without retreating back indoors.

So, Chen Pingan wisely suggested, "Brother Sun, I believe that the other party is not easy to deal with; they seem ill-intentioned. Perhaps we should take a detour?"

Brother Sun, relieved, nodded, "As cultivators, we should avoid unnecessary conflicts."

Thus, the four prepared to leave the winding path. 

However, unexpectedly, a dashing young man in splendid garments emerged from the pavilion, with a crystal-clear jade flute at his waist. In winter, he held a folded fan and lightly tapped his palm, smiling at the four travelers, "Meeting is destiny; why rush along? How about we chat in the pavilion instead?"

Upon seeing the young man with the flute, Chen Pingan couldn’t help but recall He Lu, whom he had dealt with at Cangjun Lake, the crown prince of Huangyue City, who had been kept hidden by the city lord Ye Han.

He Lu had once been renowned as one of the finest couples alongside Yan Qing from the Baodong Immortal Realm, celebrated across a dozen kingdoms.

Di Yuanfeng lowered his voice and said, "He looks like the most famous young lord of North Beiting."

The only son of the heroic lord of North Beiting, Zhan Qing, was known to be a flirtatious and romantic figure, whose reputation was mixed; he would be condemned for seducing noble ladies from the North Beiting but praised if he entangled himself with influential women from other kingdoms like the Water Cloud Kingdom or the Fuhe Country.

As for this young lord, there seemed to be no rumors of him practicing martial arts or cultivation.

At this moment, regardless of how Brother Sun and Di Yuanfeng scrutinized him, they couldn’t discern his true nature. From the looks of it, he appeared light-footed, his words lacking conviction, likely just a frivolous young master enjoying the comforts of his noble household.

Chen Pingan, too, was unable to gauge the depths of this North Beiting young lord.

This required a cautious approach.

The young lord’s expression darkened, "What’s this? The four mountain immortals, relying on your identities and cultivation, think you’re above us? Do you think I must kneel and bow before you to earn your respect?"

Chen Pingan felt a twinge of emotion; if it weren’t for his substantial backing, he would not have survived until now.

However, this showed that the Cloud City and Caique Prefecture were indeed generous immortal sects.

Otherwise, if the lineage masters from those two sects had been domineering over the years, how could these local noble scions live so freely? They would have been beaten and learned their lesson long ago, having to bow their heads in submission.

At the very least, they shouldn’t act so arrogantly in front of unfamiliar cultivators in a narrow encounter, practically asking for trouble.

After exchanging thoughts with Brother Sun and Di Yuanfeng, they decided to take a detour to avoid the confrontation.

If they were to be pursued, it would only mean they would have to go all out, fighting for their lives. Did they really think wild cultivators were just timid believers?

Just then, a graceful young female cultivator emerged from the long-abandoned pavilion, followed closely by a hunchbacked elder with little to no breath.

The woman glanced at the four travelers standing awkwardly and smiled at the young lord, "Let it go; they are just a luck-seeking band of wild cultivators. Let them pass."

Zhan Qing nodded and returned to the pavilion with the woman, while Gao Ling and the attendants also stepped aside.

The four travelers could finally resume their journey. As they passed the pavilion, Brother Sun felt a chill run down his spine.

Everyone kept their gaze fixed ahead, not daring to look back at the scene within the pavilion.

Di Yuanfeng felt a weight on his heart; this treasure-seeking mission had suddenly become a significant variable.

When the four had moved far enough, within the pavilion, Zhan Qing revealed another side of himself, grasping a dry branch to poke at the campfire, casually saying, "Those wild cultivators are no trouble. The real issue comes from the two disciples of Shen Zhenze from Cloud City. Even if Shen Zhenze himself doesn’t follow, at least one of his Dragon Gate realm attendants will likely be dispatched. Especially the temper of the ancestor from Caique Prefecture, Wu Qian, has always been poor. In other words, we need to be cautious about offending these two neighbors, rather than the opportunities within the cave."

The young woman smiled, "Cautious? I can help you make a trip to Caique Prefecture and Cloud City."

Zhan Qing raised his head, exasperated. "Sister Bai, it’s not that simple. Down here, we seek long-lasting stability; there’s no sense in being on guard against thieves."

Then Zhan Qing smiled, "But once you become a Nascent Soul, it’ll be a different story, and I can rest easy."

It turned out that this young lord had known Bai Bi since childhood, the female cultivator who was treated with great respect by the emperor of the Fuhe Country.

Since then, they had maintained a correspondence.

Bai Bi, aware of the situation, was not particularly interested in the opportunities in the cave, even if it was within the boundaries of the Fuhe Country. She had come to see Zhan Qing, effectively acting as the protector of this North Beiting lord. Zhan Qing was also a cultivator, and his master was quite reputable; however, his master was an eccentric wild Nascent Soul cultivator. Zhan Qing’s journey to become this man’s disciple had been fraught with trials, and he had endured considerable hardship, which Zhan Qing himself understood well enough not to mention to outsiders.

This was also why Bai Bi maintained a long-term connection with this noble young lord from a small country.

Otherwise, if she had merely found a cute child in the past, her feelings would have long since faded during her cultivation journey.

Later, with Zhan Qing’s help, Bai Bi managed to secure a nominal position as a protector at the Water Dragon Sect.

Both parties had gained something from the arrangement.

However, upon seeing Zhan Qing again, Bai Bi had a peculiar joy.

She never expected that the adorable child she once held in her arms had grown into such a handsome figure. After Zhan Qing's persistent pursuit, she agreed to a private arrangement that if they both reached the Golden Core realm, she would formally become his Dao companion. While Zhan Qing was still merely at the cave realm, he was already considered an exceptional cultivator.

As for the ordinary women Zhan Qing had kept in his gilded cage, they meant little to Bai Bi. 

A decade would pass, and their beauty would fade; in thirty years, they would be old and gray.

Moreover, Zhan Qing’s heart was resolute, treating so-called beauties of the mortal realm more as playthings, similar to collecting art and treasures, without much distinction.

However, once Zhan Qing reached the Dragon Gate realm, the prospect of becoming Dao companions would change the dynamics entirely. If Zhan Qing continued to dally and mingle with the mundane world, he would have to be cautious that he could end up turning into an enemy instead.

Fortunately, Zhan Qing was not foolish.

Bai Bi held back the truth from him—she had already attained the Golden Core realm, belonging to the ranks of true cultivators of the mountain.

Thus, even without relying on her identity as a disciple of the Water Dragon Sect, she had reasons to instill some degree of fear in the two immortal sects of Cloud City and Caique Prefecture.

Bai Bi took out a small porcelain bottle from her sleeve, poured out its contents, and extended her palm. A small fish, azure and green as if carved from jade, crawled onto her fingertip, tilting its head slightly to face Zhan Qing.

Zhan Qing’s keen intuition made him shiver immediately.

Bai Bi lightly flicked the fish’s head with her finger, and only then did it obediently lay down. She smiled, "This is a rare Niuhou fish from the deep pond of our Water Dragon Sect, appearing once every hundred years. Its voice can roar like thunder; when facing you, its cry can rival the force of a blow from an Earth Immortal. I just received this as a reward from the sect. When we part ways, I’ll send it to you."

Zhan Qing's expression remained unchanged. He turned to look at the captivating woman illuminated by the firelight and softly said, "I hope that in this life, the Niuhou fish will always remain in Sister Bai’s hands."

The implication behind the young lord's words was that they would only meet again without parting.

Bai Bi’s face flushed with embarrassment, and she scolded playfully, "Flattery! You’re all talk and no action; you’re quite skilled at charming words!"

Zhan Qing wore an innocent expression.

Among the group of four, aside from the stoic Huang Shi, the other three sensed the underlying tension between the young couple.

Chen Pingan was the first to break the silence, not wanting to make Brother Sun feel awkward. 

He asked a common question, "Brother Sun, is this bell the Listening Demon Bell?"

The tall, old Daoist nodded, "I found it by chance; its quality isn’t exceptional. It can sound whenever a cave realm demon approaches."

Chen Pingan marveled, "That must be worth quite a bit of celestial money. It wouldn’t go for less than a hundred celestial coins!"

Brother Sun chuckled, "That sounds about right."

Di Yuanfeng, still feeling unsettled, thought about the North Beiting young lord’s appearance. He felt self-conscious about his own looks. The audacity of this young lord to bring a female companion along while they were on this precarious treasure-seeking venture was infuriating! Moreover, the young woman was clearly a cultivator with lineage!

It was no surprise that a few wild cultivators would have two powerful martial artists as their attendants.

As for Huang Shi, he maintained his usual expression, carrying the heavy bag and walking at the back of the group.

After passing the pavilion, the four of them walked at a brisk pace.

The winding mountain path stretched for over a hundred miles, and even seasoned country woodcutters found it challenging. Yet for the four of them, it felt like walking on flat ground.

This was the advantage of cultivation.

No matter how rough the roads of the mortal realm were, cultivators could traverse them without a care.

While the world was full of dangers and perils, cultivators seemed to effortlessly smooth things over.

As for the worries along the path of cultivation, it felt as though they were merely standing and talking, not needing to complain of back pain.

After over a hundred miles of hiking, they encountered no one.

With some basic geomantic skills, Brother Sun could easily discern the terrain, leading the three to a secluded cliff area. A dark, deep cave lay at the foot of the cliff, devoid of any stele or inscription, with vines hanging from either side. This plant could stabilize the terrain among worldly flora. The tall, old Daoist plucked a vibrant green leaf from the vine, crushed it between his fingers to smell it, nodded in satisfaction, but said nothing further. 

Then, the old Daoist began to pace, occasionally stamping his feet before finally crouching down to grab a handful of earth, weighing it in his hand. He then turned to ask, "Since you can draw soil talismans, you must be quite familiar with the nature of the earth. Do you have any unique insights? This might be helpful for us to enter the residence."

Chen Pingan appeared troubled.

Di Yuanfeng narrowed his eyes.

Huang Shi also turned to look at the black-robed elder, who was now showing signs of hesitation.

With a sigh, Chen Pingan took a few steps forward, varying the weight of his footsteps, seemingly trying to identify the soil, and spoke as he walked, "I suppose I should humbly share my knowledge, but with Brother Sun here, I worry it may be a joke. However, since Brother Sun has instructed me, I’ll dare to share some of what I've learned."

Chen Pingan crouched down to pick up a bit of soil, tossing it lightly before holding it in his palm and rubbing it gently. After releasing it, he moved to several other spots, repeating the process, and finally said, "Indeed, this soil has been enriched with spiritual energy, likely soaked for at least three hundred years. Due to its moist and heavy nature, it is far denser than ordinary soil. In worldly residences, or even in graves, if this soil is added, it can assist in gathering wind and water."

After finishing his explanation, the three men saw the black-robed elder apologize, saying to wait a moment, before hurriedly removing his bag from his shoulder. Turning his back to the group, he began to rummage through his belongings, taking out a small porcelain jar and hastily digging soil to fill it. However, he only managed to collect a little from several spots, and in the end, the jar couldn’t be filled.

Seeing this scene almost caused the tall, old Daoist to lose control and join in the digging.

But realizing that he was now a master from the Thunder God’s residence, Brother Sun refrained from following suit.

Chen Pingan adjusted his pack and clapped his hands, grinning, "Just earning a little pocket change; I hope I don’t make a fool of myself."

At this moment, Di Yuanfeng could finally confirm that if this old fellow were truly a lineage master, he could easily swallow that bamboo staff hiding a soft sword, including both bamboo and sword.

Then, the three of them noticed that the elder had fallen into a daze.

Brother Sun had no choice but to remind him, "Friend, shouldn’t you take out a barrier-breaking talisman before entering this residence?"

Although this first barrier was merely a common mountain water illusion, similar to being lost in a maze, it had already been broken by the previous unfortunate souls who arrived earlier. Yet, the following mechanism was life-threatening. Out of caution, it was still necessary to use a barrier-breaking talisman to clear the way, and anyway, the talisman wouldn’t cost the three of them anything.

Chen Pingan affected a look of sudden understanding, pulling out a common yellow paper talisman made of gold powder.

However, he quickly turned to glance back down the path, troubled, "That young lord is not far behind us."

Di Yuanfeng laughed, "If we can’t take the lead now, will we just hand over the treasures to that young lord if we find them?"

Only then did Chen Pingan lightly flick the talisman with two fingers, and it ignited, illuminating the path to the cave.

However, he did not lead the way but held onto the slowly burning barrier-breaking talisman and offered it to Di Yuanfeng, smiling ingratiatingly, "Why don’t you take the lead, Young Master Qin? My old bones can’t withstand even the slightest pain; if I accidentally trigger a dangerous mechanism and injure myself, I could still speak about it, but if it leads to a major disaster, it would be unfortunate."

Di Yuanfeng looked toward Huang Shi, who was studying the stone walls of the cave.

Huang Shi showed no hesitation, taking the barrier-breaking talisman and stepping toward the depths of the cave.

The four of them wound along the path for several miles, still not reaching the end.

A cool breeze blew, yet there was no sense of any malevolent aura.

This reassured Brother Sun somewhat.

The previous owner of this immortal cave must have been a benevolent lineage master. Although there were life-threatening mechanisms beyond the barriers, the first illusion was a kind reminder, and according to the wild cultivator who had escaped, the illusion caused no harm; two prior entries had resulted in merely going in circles, and when the time was up, one would be confusedly led out of the cave. Otherwise, in an ordinary abandoned residence, the first barrier was typically a perilous existence, not to mention that cultivators trespassing into someone else's dwelling were deserving of death.

Because the four of them walked slowly and cautiously, it took them a full half hour to arrive at a cold and eerie cave chamber.

Brother Sun had to say many times before the black-robed elder would take out another barrier-breaking talisman to illuminate the path while also guarding against lurking evils.

During this time, Brother Sun, considering the value of that talisman and his own life, carefully told the black-robed elder about the prohibitions of this journey.

These were lessons learned at the cost of two lives from the previous wild cultivators.

Brother Sun certainly didn’t want this fellow to act rashly and trigger mechanisms, dragging the three of them to their graves.

On the stone walls surrounding the chamber were vibrant, newly-painted murals depicting four heavenly kings, towering over three meters tall, exuding an imposing presence, their fierce eyes gazing down at the unexpected guests.

The four lifelike figures held weapons drawn, cradled pipa, entwined with serpents, and held up umbrellas.

Underfoot was a bagua formation, carved with the ancient design of two dragons fighting for a pearl. However, the spot where the pearl should have been was slightly sunken, empty of anything—likely taken by some previous visitor.

Brother Sun only glanced at the divine statues but felt a prickling unease.

Still, he forced himself to pull out a small compass from his sleeve carefully.

The compass was small but intricate, with over thirty-six layers both inside and outside. If an ordinary person were to hold it, they would likely be left dumbfounded by the complexity.

The tall, old Daoist began to walk around the bagua formation, "wandering" beneath the feet of the four heavenly kings.

Di Yuanfeng softly reminded, "Brother Sun, it’s best to hurry. Once that North Beiting young lord enters, we’ll be trapped like fish in a barrel. According to the lucky wild cultivator, as long as we don’t touch the four divine statues, we can mess around without any concerns. He wouldn’t dare make such claims if he didn’t have confidence, or he’d have no way to leave North Beiting."

Brother Sun's scalp began to sweat, and he replied seriously, "Care must be taken; we should be cautious."

Huang Shi glanced at the statue holding the sword and then shifted his gaze to the pipa strings.

Di Yuanfeng crouched down, carefully examining the two stone dragons that had lost their pearls.

Huang Shi suddenly halted his gaze, focusing on a spot that extended from the sword's tip, crouching next to one of the statues to peer closely. He squinted, spotting some minuscule writing that even a cultivator would find challenging to notice. However, much of it had been erased, leaving only a few trivial words. Judging by the traces, it seemed to have originally been two or three hundred characters, but the crucial parts had been completely wiped away. It was highly likely that someone had intentionally left behind these useless words to frustrate later visitors.

The writing on the wall near the statue remained, and now only the phrase "…of good nature, fond of visiting immortals, with a bamboo staff and straw sandals, having traversed numerous mountains, but this mountain is the most serene—yet this place has many prohibitions, which must not be overlooked. Should there be future peers who chance upon this place, they should…"

And the last interrupted phrase "focus on what lies beyond the sky… ancient dragon pool in the rain…" clearly resembled a poet's nonsensical verse.

Huang Shi was infuriated.

Undoubtedly, it was the previous visitors who had intentionally obscured this precious clue.

However, Huang Shi glanced at Di Yuanfeng, who was just as much a bamboo staff and straw sandals type. 

Could it be that this fellow was the one truly fated with this place?

Chen Pingan crouched down beside Huang Shi, who was also left confused. Di Yuanfeng was no exception.

But relative to the others, Chen Pingan was the most indifferent.

If he were to unlock the second layer of the cave’s barriers, he would only need to remain alert; why bother?

Yet Chen Pingan quickly sighed, silently reminding himself that this kind of thinking was not advisable.

Huang Shi suddenly spoke, "If I use a ground escape talisman, will it really trigger the mechanisms?"

Di Yuanfeng replied solemnly, "That’s confirmed! The previous wild cultivator attempted it and met his end. Unless it’s that legendary talisman that can shake the mountain without a tremor, there might be a chance, but I suspect it would require consuming many talismans, which are invaluable. Even if we could obtain them, it would likely not be worth the cost."

Chen Pingan had no idea what the mountain-opening talisman was, but he shifted his mindset and began to genuinely observe the characters, frowning. He spread his palm and gently stroked the letters and the extensive wear marks.

Then Chen Pingan said, "Could it be possible that the writings and the erased parts were done by the same person, and the opening clue has been hidden within these characters all along?"

Huang Shi scoffed audibly, showing no restraint. 

Looking back, the tall, old Daoist was still fumbling around like a headless fly.

Huang Shi figured that if all else failed, he would have to resort to force.

As for whether the other three would die under the mechanisms, that would be left to fate.

But Di Yuanfeng found some merit in Chen Pingan’s words, focusing his gaze on the remaining text and pondering carefully.

Di Yuanfeng stood up, leaning back to inspect one of the statues, then slowly turned and glanced at the other three fierce-looking statues.

Then Di Yuanfeng walked to the center of the chamber, extended one hand, bent his knees slightly, and lowered his palm.

Finally, Di Yuanfeng crouched down, his open hand resting below a dragon’s claw.

Di Yuanfeng said to the tall, old Daoist, "Can you calculate the precise hexagram of this place, Brother Sun? Surely you can do this!"

Brother Sun, holding the mountain compass in one hand, wiped the sweat from his forehead with the other, then quickly tucked his hand back into his sleeve, swiftly forming hand signs while his eyes fixed on the point where Di Yuanfeng's palm rested, murmuring, "The death gate is not logical."

Di Yuanfeng kept his palm pressed against the ground, his expression brooding, urging, "Why would Daoists fear death?! Brother Sun, can’t you see through this?"

Moments later, Brother Sun exclaimed, "This is an auspicious place!"

Di Yuanfeng then turned his palm over, gently making a fist and striking the ground, yet there was still no response.

Di Yuanfeng frowned.

Huang Shi approached, pressing his ear to the ground, then looked up and said, "There’s an echo, like the sound of dripping water, but it’s unusual. This must be how to trigger the correct mechanism."

Di Yuanfeng took a deep breath and struck the ground once more.

In an instant, phenomena erupted.

The bagua formation beneath them began to spin, transforming quickly, leaving spectators transfixed. There was no longer an arrangement, and both Chen Pingan and the old Daoist found themselves jumping around, but each time they landed, they found themselves shifted out of position, looking quite out of sorts. However, it was still better than one of them stumbling and falling, as the ground shifted beneath them like a blade.

Di Yuanfeng and Huang Shi stood firm, their feet rooted, avoiding unnecessary movement. The ground occasionally offered resistance, causing them to lightly push off their toes, but they remained in place, showing more grace than the other two.

The two originally lifeless green dragons seemed to have lost their restraints, wanting to swim into the sea.

As for the entrance to the cave chamber, the heavy stone door had already crashed down, and even Huang Shi couldn’t intervene in time, let alone attempt to escape.

Di Yuanfeng surveyed the surroundings, ultimately fixing his gaze on the only unchanged spot—the indentation where the pearl had once been placed.

Di Yuanfeng called out to Huang Shi, "Pass me the wine flask!"

Huang Shi passed over a flask, and Di Yuanfeng removed the mud seal, pouring it into the indentation.

The ground shifted slightly.

Di Yuanfeng felt a sense of assurance and turned to shout, "Chen, hurry up and take out a water talisman; don’t bother with fancy techniques! Just transform it into water!"

Chen Pingan flicked out a water talisman, tossing it into the air, where it transformed into a column of water imbued with spiritual essence. Di Yuanfeng reached out, cupping the water in his hand and gently placing it in the indentation.

In the blink of an eye, a splendid light erupted in the cave chamber. Huang Shi was the last to close his eyes; the black-robed elder was the first, and only after that did Huang Shi feel at ease with him.

The four figures swayed.

It felt as though they had crossed into another world.

Brother Sun stumbled to the ground, feeling dizzy and beginning to vomit.

As for Chen Pingan, he was worse off, already sitting down and dry-heaving.

Di Yuanfeng straightened up, looking around, the smile on his face couldn’t be restrained as he burst out laughing, "What an extraordinary hidden paradise in the mountains!"

This immortal cave was teeming with spiritual energy, far surpassing the worldly kingdoms of North Beiting, invigorating the spirit.

In the distance stood a majestic green mountain, with tranquil waters winding at the foot, creating a small realm where the air was thick but refreshing. 

On the high mountain, pavilions and towers were built in layers along the slopes, continuing endlessly. At its peak sat an ancient Daoist temple with a roof covered in green glazed tiles, surrounded by flocks of cranes circling in the sky.

This was what one would call a paradise on earth.

Huang Shi slowly stood up, but he believed that Di Yuanfeng had already guessed he was not just some ordinary fifth realm martial artist.

But at this point, what did it matter?

This Di Yuanfeng, a mere fifth realm martial artist with a broken sword and a few techniques, wouldn’t dare challenge him.

If not for the many unforeseen events that might still occur, Huang Shi could easily eliminate the three of them, as if he were wringing the necks of three chicks.

Di Yuanfeng grinned, "Brother Sun, Brother Chen, Brother Huang, our collaboration this time was truly a testament to the power of sincerity! It’s evident that we should all occupy this land of fortune together!"

Brother Sun shook his sleeves, stroking his beard and smiling, returning to his former transcendental demeanor.

Yet, the lingering taste of wine mixed with meat in his mouth made him reluctant to speak.

Chen Pingan observed his surroundings, feeling a sense of nostalgia.

If he had been alone in that chamber, he might have pondered longer and discovered clues, but Di Yuanfeng’s hand had landed precisely on the death gate of the bagua formation, which might have caused him to feel anxious. However, this Brother Sun was able to rely on the compass to deduce that place was indeed an auspicious spot for life and death transitions. This encouraged Di Yuanfeng to strike without hesitation.

As for needing the water talisman, Chen Pingan had not tried to hide it; he had already drawn the talisman before Di Yuanfeng could remind him.

The other party had likely taken notice, and though they hadn’t paid attention at the time, they were beginning to appreciate it now.

Chen Pingan was merely indicating to Young Master Qin that while his cultivation might be lacking, his mind was still sharp, so if they managed to find themselves in an immortal cave, even if they engaged in treachery, it would be better to wait a little longer before taking action.

In the cave chamber, two young men and women stood alongside the two elders, one of whom smiled as he stored away a talisman that had appeared from thin air, gently turning it into ashes.

The earlier scene of the four successfully breaking the formation had been witnessed and heard by all.

If Chen Pingan had been present, he would have immediately recognized the three individuals: the old man from Cloud City from whom he had purchased talismans, and the two young men and women patrolling the market streets.

They were none other than the old master Huan Yang and the two direct disciples of Shen Zhenze from Cloud City.

The young woman expressed her surprise and shock, curiously asking, "Did Master Huan predict that this group of wild cultivators would lead us to the door?"

Huan Yang chuckled, not pretending to be a wise man, shaking his head. "They’ll be near the cave entrance soon. Along the way, several talismans have already stirred; this old man merely wished to avoid conflict. In a narrow encounter, with no retreat, would we engage in a fight? Moreover, although the North Beiting young lord has yet to leave the pavilion, his attitude suggests he considers this place his own. If we make a fuss, he’ll likely come rushing in, resulting in a chaotic three-way battle with more casualties. Your city lord’s master sent you down to experience the world, not to seek death.”

Huan Yang walked to where the ground had returned to its original state, lamenting, "So, in the path of the Great Way, sometimes retreating a step is akin to advancing several steps."

Huan Yang suddenly laughed, "Ah! No wonder you two seventh realm martial artists are here; with just one punch each, you’ve already smashed my two valuable roadside talismans. There must be a master among your group; an ordinary martial artist would never perceive the subtle ripples of the talismans. Or perhaps that young lady is actually a Golden Core Earth Immortal?"

The young woman, feeling anxious, asked, "Why doesn’t Master Huan quickly trigger the mechanism?"

The old elder from Cloud City slowly replied, "If those wild cultivators are lying in wait, consider this: if you two act rashly and move forward with a punch, will you live or die? Even if you survive, you’ll be injured; isn’t that still a loss?"

The young couple exchanged concerned glances, feeling a sense of dread.

The elder hesitated before asking, "Master Huan, can I collapse the cave's entrance?"

Huan Yang smiled, "If you aren’t afraid that the other party would lose their way and we would have no way back, then you can naturally act without hesitation."

The elder fell silent.

Huan Yang, catching a glimpse of the two youngsters, sighed inwardly, discerning the clear distinction in character between the two.

The young woman was anxious, while the young man remained calm.

If this continued, it would be uncertain whether they could become immortal companions.

Within that spiritual cave filled with energy, Chen Pingan felt like a fish back in water. 

He could easily imagine the little green-robed boys in his own Water Palace getting busy soon.

*(The chapter ends here.)*

 **Chapter 640: Treasure Obtained**

The four paused for a moment, exchanging a glance before Di Yuanfeng, with his hand resting on the hilt of his sword, nodded at Master Huang. Together, they sprinted toward the distant green mountain.

Earlier, where they had landed, there was a large round blue stone resembling a coffered ceiling pattern, which should have been positioned above the interior of a Daoist temple. To their surprise, in this fairy realm, it lay beneath their feet. 

At the center of this coffered ceiling design was a lotus blossom, encircled by two intertwined dragons, and further surrounded by sixteen flying celestial beings. The layers were numerous, intricately detailed, and exquisitely beautiful.

Di Yuanfeng struck the stone multiple times with his bamboo staff, producing a sound like metal striking stone, indicating its unyielding nature. 

However, even though he could potentially move it, Di Yuanfeng dared not act recklessly, as they needed to pass through this place to leave the fairy mansion's ruins. The reason he and Master Huang feigned a pause earlier was undoubtedly precautionary. If someone had secretly followed them into this place, they would have to face the consequences of their actions.

Lagging behind, Chen Ping'an discreetly withdrew a Yang Energy Lantern Talisman, still showing no signs of malice. Compared to the outside world, the talisman burned much more slowly here, likely due to the abundant spiritual energy (Qi) in this location. The other three merely glanced at it before dismissing it.

Between the green hills and clear waters lay a white jade arch bridge. It resembled a white rainbow resting upon the water.

The bridge's railings and pillars were intricately carved with a variety of mythical beasts, each unique, crafted with such skill that they appeared to be slumbering creatures.

Near the water's surface beneath the bridge were large stone piers, carved into the likeness of one of the legendary dragon species, sporting two horns and covered in dragon scales, sculpted in a crouching position, peering into the water.

Chen Ping'an fell into contemplation. 

The creature beneath the bridge was not an exceptionally rare beast statue; it was merely odd that its name was quite peculiar. 

In the realm of Haoran, it was generally referred to as "Baxia" or "Eight Summers," but in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, Chen Ping'an had seen this creature while traversing the rivers and bridges of the southern garden country. Its appearance differed slightly from that in Haoran. According to the books that National Master Zhong Qiu had retrieved from the Ministry of Works, the one Chen Ping'an had read the most was "Yingzao Fashi," which recorded this creature as a "Gongwen," a water-avoiding beast that could swallow entire rivers. It was said to have been raised by an ancient master of the rivers and lakes and was rumored to have been boiled alive by the Fire God using methods of lake boiling and sea burning.

However, there were no such bizarre records in Haoran. Only vague mentions of the dragon's nine offspring were noted, and there was certainly no mention of any "master of the rivers and lakes."

Suppressing his thoughts, Chen Ping'an pulled out a Sword Qi Bridge Crossing Talisman. After a moment of hesitation, he chose not to hand it to Master Huang and the others, instead walking directly onto the arch bridge.

There was no wind, no waves, and no danger.

Chen Ping'an crossed the white jade arch bridge, turning back to wave, signaling that there were no traps, and it was safe to cross.

The other three had their own thoughts. Sun Daoren felt that this Chen Daoist likely thought they were about to enter a treasure mountain and wanted to show off a little. It was futile; this Daoist was destined to die regardless. Back at the rocky cliff by the stream, he shouldn't have agreed to accompany them, let alone enter this treasure-laden fairy mansion's ruins together. But just as he thought this, the tall, lean Daoist was suddenly alarmed, wondering if he might also encounter misfortune.

The young clerics of the ledger were on their way down the mountain for training, seeking treasures and cultivating their skills. As long as they didn't run into hostile sects, they usually got along amicably; even if they were strangers, revealing their identities would establish a bond of Daoist affinity and shared incense. The dynamics were generally not too ugly.

However, among the mountain dwellers and wild practitioners, most formed small groups of three or four. Fewer wouldn’t accomplish anything, while more often led to many disputes; the slightest disturbance could lead to internal strife before they even reached the point of sharing the spoils. Competing with ledger clerics for opportunities was like ascending to the heavens, so during the competition, they were usually more willing to risk their lives. Once trapped in a desperate situation, loose cultivators might even unite against a common enemy, unwilling to part with their capital. However, once the spoils were divided, what was so hard about backstabbing? As wild practitioners, if the overall situation was settled, yet none had thoughts of devouring the benefits alone, what sort of wild practitioners would they be?

Di Yuanfeng noticed Sun Daoren's wandering gaze and chuckled, "What's wrong? Are you worried that Huang and I will trick you? It's such a rare blessed land; how much can we three really carry away? Since we can't take everything, is there really a need for us to kill each other?"

Hearing this, Sun Daoren felt it made sense and couldn't help but stroke his beard, squinting with a smile.

The three crossed the white jade arch bridge. Sun Daoren, taking advantage of the moment when no one was watching, squatted down to touch the surface of the white jade bridge. It wasn't the ordinary sheep-fat jade of the secular world; wasn't this yet another pile of immortal wealth just lying there? 

Sun Daoren tapped it lightly with his fingers, the sound crisp and melodious. 

It was as enchanting as hearing the gentle clinking of two small summer coins for the first time, captivating and endlessly pleasurable.

As Di Yuanfeng approached the mountain gate, he looked up at the staircase leading straight to the mountain peak and said with a smile, "Let's take a detour, enjoy the scenery, and confirm there's no one around before we head straight to the top."

The other three had no objections. 

At the mountain gate stood a simple yet massive archway, boasting the bold characters "Cave Heaven Blessed Land." 

The couplets on either side were still carved from stone. 

"Silent and motionless, communication is divine." 
"The one who gains its elegance is the most spiritual."

Chen Ping'an stared at these couplets for a long time.

In truth, they were not even close to being parallel. 

But the tone was grand, and the meaning profound.

Master Huang was the first to look away from the plaque and couplets, his gaze shifting to the distance and the heights. 

Di Yuanfeng instead looked toward the back of the archway, where thirty-six stone monuments stood at varying heights, but for some reason, the inscriptions on them had all been worn smooth. 

It seemed this relic could only convey its origins through the four characters "Cave Heaven Blessed Land," which were nearly meaningless. As for the couplets, they were even more bewildering. 

Sun Daoren looked up at the ancient seal on the plaque and clicked his tongue. "What a hodgepodge of terms; it's only fitting it was destroyed."

Throughout history, cave heavens and blessed lands have undergone many changes; they were not immutable. They could be shattered by powerful cultivators or could mysteriously vanish. Alternatively, a cave heaven could fall to become a blessed land; yet Sun Daoren firmly believed that there was no such thing as "the world's cave heaven." Moreover, while the spiritual energy here was abundant, it should still be somewhat lacking compared to the legendary cave heavens, as records from various unofficial histories on the mountain often linked cave heavens to "spiritual energy as thick as water." This place, with its dense water flow, was still far from that assertion.

Compared to the other three, Chen Ping'an had a deeper understanding of cave heavens and blessed lands. However, he had never heard of "the world's cave heaven." As for inferring the era of the cave dwelling based on architectural style, that was futile, as Chen Ping'an's knowledge of the North Continent was still quite shallow. 

In times like this, he couldn't help but feel a deeper admiration for the ledger clerics who came from sect backgrounds. The depth of a mountain's foundation truly required generations of patriarchs to accumulate.

He could only take note of it, and if given the chance, he would return to sketch the main architectural structures and later show them to Cui Dongshan. 

Di Yuanfeng withdrew his gaze and nodded with a smile. "Quite peculiar indeed."

Afterward, the four set off again, moving briskly past grand halls, pavilions, and corridors, occasionally spotting withered bones littering the ground, suggesting that those corpses had suddenly perished. 

No one attempted to enter through the doors. 

They still wanted to investigate the Daoist temple at the mountain peak first. 

Generally speaking, the most valuable treasures were found at higher elevations. 

This unknown fairy mansion was rife with fine scratches, but none were particularly deep. 

It was as if a sudden downpour of Sword Qi had struck without warning, catching everyone off guard. 

This sword strike was undoubtedly the work of a sword immortal; it was just unclear whether they were from the Jade Purity realm or an immortal sword cultivator. 

As for why there had been such a peculiar sword strike, with Sword Qi flooding the area, it seemed to accurately target people as if it were waiting for them to be struck. 

Chen Ping'an looked up. 

It was truly anyone's guess. 

In any case, this vast fairy sect had collapsed and vanished in an instant. 

As they continued upward, the atmosphere grew increasingly silent. 

Sun Daoren walked anxiously, as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over him, instinctively reaching to rub the pagoda bell at his waist. 

What if there were demons or ghosts hiding here? 

Or perhaps among these corpses, someone had died and their soul condensed into a vengeful spirit, occupying this fairy mansion for who knows how many years, and they had been a fool in life, yet should have transformed into a ghostly being by now? 

Thus, Sun Daoren felt the need to rub the pagoda bell more to find some peace of mind. 

In fact, this bell had its own peculiar use; the closer a lowly existence approached, the more frantic and frequent the sound of the bell would become. The higher the realm, up to the Dragon Gate realm, the more it would annoy the bearer with its noise. However, if a Golden Core demon were nearby, the pagoda bell would not shake violently; to outsiders, it would appear entirely still, yet it would quietly ring once in the heart lake of its owner after being refined.

It was the pagoda bell's subtle warning that had allowed Sun Daoren to escape a calamity. 

Sun Daoren could only hope that this time, the bell would not sound in his heart lake. 

The three allies had discussed that dealing with a Dragon Gate realm cultivator, even if they had a magical artifact, wouldn't pose too much of a problem for a ledger cleric. 

Thus, Sun Daoren hoped that the more violently the pagoda bell shook, the better, as long as it didn’t disturb the heavens. 

As the four passed those corpses, Di Yuanfeng would wave his sleeve, and the clothes worn by the bones would disintegrate into dust from the shockwave. Moreover, many ornaments that should have contained spiritual energy still met the same fate, turning to ash. 

Only the bones remained, untouched by the force. 

Another strange occurrence. 

After ten or so attempts, with no results, the tall, lean elder began to take action, trying to imitate Di Yuanfeng, but regrettably, his luck was poor and he still failed to find a single robe. 

Di Yuanfeng turned to Master Huang, saying, "How about you give it a try, Brother Huang? Perhaps the winds of fortune have shifted."

Indeed, after that, Master Huang did find something on the mountain staircase, waving his arm, and the clothes on the corpse remained intact, prompting Sun Daoren to rush over to strip the garments. 

To hell with the divine demeanor of the Thunder God! 

I’m just a wild practitioner who has never touched even half a summer coin in my life! 

However, even after acquiring them, Sun Daoren painfully handed them over to Master Huang. 

This was the rule among wild practitioners. 

Of course, there were even greater rules awaiting the four, but for now, it seemed that it was all up to this Chen Daoist. 

Sun Daoren rarely felt a twinge of compassion. 

Could it be that he should show some Bodhisattva-like kindness and persuade Di Yuanfeng and Master Huang? 

If everyone were to return loaded with treasures and it was impossible to empty this place of its hoard, then there would be no need for killing and looting, right? 

But Sun Daoren hesitated, deciding to wait and see what they could find before discussing other matters. 

Otherwise, if in the end, they couldn't even fill one or two bags, his indecision and softness would only lead to resentment from those two, and who knew, they might even decide to eliminate him too.

Chen Ping'an kept trailing behind the three. 

After finishing the last step, he arrived at the white jade plaza in front of the Daoist temple, where he spotted two smaller corpses. After Di Yuanfeng waved his sleeve, their clothes vanished, but each left behind one relic. 

However, the two mountain treasures were heavily cracked and marred in appearance. 

Di Yuanfeng squatted down to collect them, carefully stowing them in his sleeve. 

Master Huang remarked, "It seems that the spiritual artifacts here aren't in very good condition." 

Di Yuanfeng nodded, laughing, "Then let’s win by quantity." 

Sun Daoren was overjoyed. 

Master Huang also revealed a rare smile. 

Chen Ping'an still did not join in; he was accustomed to considering an escape route before discussing treasure hunting.

Standing at the mountain's peak, he gazed out, taking in the scenery. Beyond the green hills and clear waters, he could see everything within a hundred miles—just varying distances and blurred vision. However, further still, there appeared to be a remarkably clear boundary, beyond which a sudden transformation made the world shrouded in mist, giving Chen Ping'an a sense of oppressive emptiness, as if he had reached the end of the road.

This was both a good and a bad thing. 

The good was that this fairy cave was a legendary land without roots, akin to the shattered ancient cave heavens, not truly built within the mountains and waters. 

It indicated that this fairy ruin had a long history and profound origins, perhaps holding treasures of immense value, or even a couple of secret texts pointing directly to the Earth Immortal realm.

The bad thing was that entry was easy, but exit would be difficult, unless someone could break the restrictions of this small world. 

With a sword immortal behind him, Chen Ping'an certainly could do so; he believed that even the firmest canopy couldn't compare to the ghostly valley of bones. 

Yet at that time, he would become the target of all the mountain heads, which contradicted his original intention of "sneaking around to pick up small treasures and quietly leaving."

Chen Ping'an did not wish to become the second Jiang Shangzhen, becoming a pariah among the cultivators of the North Continent, hunted by all.

The reason Master Huang and the others felt so at ease was likely that they had yet to notice the strange phenomena in the mountains and waters beyond. This indicated that Master Huang, a martial artist of the Golden Body realm, was not just a paper tiger, but neither was he particularly strong.

The existence of that line held little significance for Chen Ping'an at the moment. 

However, if the worst-case scenario occurred, he would be the only one who could see and escape from this small world. 

The other three remained oblivious, possibly planning how to backstab their Daoist friend. 

The Daoist temple before them was small, the plaque missing. Before entering, all four couldn't help but admire the green glazed tiles on the roof. 

In a place with so many buildings, only this spot had such tiles. 

Years rolled by, yet the tiles still shimmered; they were clearly not the kind of ordinary glazed tiles found in the palaces or noble houses of the secular world, but true treasures of the mountains, objects used by the immortal families. 

In short, every single tile was worth an immortal's coin. 

This scene made Sun Daoren tremble all over, estimating that each tile could be worth seven or eight small summer coins. If these were truly high-quality tiles crafted using immortal methods, perhaps he could even exchange summer coins for rainy season coins! 

Both Master Huang and Di Yuanfeng, coming from purely martial backgrounds, could not accurately assess the value of these glazed tiles, much like Sun Daoren. However, among the sects and fairy mansions they had encountered, none had ever covered their rooftops with such tiles; they were more common in the secular world below.

Chen Ping'an finally looked back at where the four had come from, noticing still no movement. 

There was one question he wanted to ask the person below if he had the opportunity. 

Roughly, at what hour had they entered this small world? 

In fact, Chen Ping'an had been keeping track of time all along. 

If the flow of time within this place significantly differed from that of the Haoran world, then he had better and worse plans. 

The young lord of North Pavilion, Zhan Qing, and his entourage arrived at the cave's entrance. 

The martial artist from the Huqi Kingdom, Gao Ling, spoke in a deep voice, “Young lord, there are many people hiding near the mountain.” 

Zhan Qing laughed, “They’re just eating our dust. If they have the courage to enter the cave, they should also have the courage to reincarnate.” 

He held no fondness for mountain dwellers or ledger clerics. 

Even though he himself was a genuine practitioner, perhaps deep down he was still a scion of nobility, accustomed to scheming with cunning while relying on his fists and a few treasures, rather than the brutality of killing. Therefore, Zhan Qing felt utterly annoyed with those high and mighty fellow cultivators. 

However, when it came to a situation where he needed to kill, Zhan Qing would not hesitate. 

Bai Bi joked, “Aren't you the least bit worried? What if those two groups get ahead of us?” 

Zhan Qing replied with a laugh, “If they can refine immortal treasures and consume secret texts in the blink of an eye, even if I have bad luck, I’d just have to accept it. Otherwise, where could they possibly escape to?” 

Gao Ling began to see Zhan Qing in a new light. 

Previously, he had thought of the young lord of North Pavilion as a waste who had simply been born into a good family. 

Now it seemed that anyone who underestimated this person during the so-called 'great way competition' would surely find themselves in hot water. 

The two Golden Body realm martial artists led the way, holding candles as they stepped into the dark cave. 

Bai Bi felt relaxed; as long as there were no major accidents, this treasure hunting trip would not require her to act personally. 

Even if the likes of Caique's Sun Qing and Yunshang City’s Shen Zhenze were to come in person, they would only be minor inconveniences. 

The two Golden Body realm martial artists in her party were enough to handle everything. 

They reached a cave chamber adorned with four painted murals of celestial kings. 

Zhan Qing frowned slightly; breaking formations was not his forte. His Yuan Ying master, a wild practitioner, had a mixed bag of skills and should be well-versed in this, yet he never taught Zhan Qing anything about seeking opportunities in secret realms, always saying that such tricks would hinder his cultivation, and he could discuss it once Zhan Qing reached the Dragon Gate realm.

Since the first group of wild practitioners and the Yunshang City cultivators had vanished, they must have entered the fairy mansion ruins one after another. 

Bai Bi smiled, "What should we do next? Just stand here staring at each other?" 

Zhan Qing replied helplessly, “If we knew the exit location, we could wait for a rabbit. What I fear is that we might be separated by a hundred miles and not discover anything.” 

Bai Bi placed her hands behind her back, surveying the surroundings. “Let’s look for clues. If that fails, you’ll owe me a huge favor.” 

Zhan Qing asked, “Is the price steep?” 

Bai Bi nodded, “Not small. It would cost me a decade of cultivation.” 

This direct disciple of the Water Dragon Sect cautiously summoned a rare talisman, an ancient blue talisman depicting flowing water, simple yet peculiar. The water drawn on the talisman appeared to flow gently, and one could even faintly hear the sound of water flowing. 

A Golden Core cultivator from a sect who was willing to refine a talisman into a life-bound artifact meant that this talisman was at least of magical artifact quality. 

Bai Bi explained, “This is an ancient talisman my master obtained by chance years ago, from the ruins of one of the three ancient shrines in Jidu, named the Inch Gold Talisman. It has many marvelous uses, especially for cultivating water techniques, yielding twice the result with half the effort. There was some unpleasantness in my sect regarding its ownership, but that’s not worth mentioning. One of its uses can help us enter the secret realm.” 

The Inch Gold Talisman was also known as the Talisman of Time. 

It was enigmatic and profound. 

Though Zhan Qing was uncertain about the talisman's origins, he still shook his head, “Let’s pass on it.” 

Bai Bi sighed, “I’m already a Golden Core Earth Immortal, equivalent to ten years of cultivation for a Dragon Gate realm qi practitioner. What’s the big deal? The greater the difference in realms, the more disparate the results. It's the same for qi practitioners and martial artists.” 

Zhan Qing smiled wryly, “Sister Bai.” 

Bai Bi smiled back, “Just calling me Sister Bai is enough.” 

Even Zhan Qing, with his cold demeanor, found it hard to resist wanting to reach out and hold her hand. 

But Bai Bi shook her head, maintaining her calm demeanor. “Many of those sheltered in your golden nest would willingly die for you. Why are you not moved? Just because I’m a Golden Core Earth Immortal and would lose a few years of my cultivation, you feel touched? Such sentimental attachments are better left aside. If in the future, a Yuan Ying female cultivator were to make such sacrifices for you, would you not then change your affections? True immortal companions on the mountain are far from such superficialities.” 

Zhan Qing felt as if he had been struck by lightning, left speechless. 

Bai Bi suddenly said, “Before using the Inch Gold Talisman, let’s first ponder for clues and avoid charging in recklessly. The fists of the two Golden Body realm martial artists shouldn’t be wasted. If neither works, then I’ll take action.” 

Zhan Qing felt somewhat relieved at this. 

Looking at the enchanting Bai Bi, he felt a bit estranged. 

Huan Yun appeared in this fairy cave and immediately placed a unique talisman on the three individuals beside him, concealing their presence and aura. 

As for the ripples in their auras while walking, Huan Yun, merely a Golden Core Earth Immortal from the talisman sect, couldn’t achieve perfection like a Daoist deity with celestial techniques. 

The old cultivator from Yunshang City sighed in relief; avoiding an ambush was a good thing. 

Huan Yun suddenly said, “You all can wander about now. Aside from life and death struggles, I won’t concern myself with you three. The gains and losses beyond life and death are all up to fate.” 

Then Huan Yun smiled, “Rest assured, I won’t compete with you. At most, I’ll just pick up what you leave behind or what you failed to discover.” 

Huan Yun’s form dissipated like mist, leaving no trace. 

The old cultivator and the two juniors laughed. “Huan Zhenren always keeps his word. Let’s go, and you two should focus on how to deal with the wild practitioners.” 

Hearing the underlying meaning in the protector’s words, the woman worriedly asked, “What about you, Master?” 

The old cultivator replied helplessly, “Should I really pick up things for you two and carry them? Did you come here just for a leisurely outing? Am I your porter?” 

The old cultivator soared into the wind, wanting to see just how high the canopy of this cave was and, from a height, to observe the greater mysteries hidden below. 

But being cautious, he summoned a spirit artifact that wasn't his life-bound object, rising into the air to avoid crashing into mountain formations. 

Entering this unowned fairy mansion ruin, there were certainly treasures to be found everywhere. 

But there would also be hidden dangers waiting for those picking up money. 

In fact, the old cultivator felt both happy and worried. The opportunities here were undoubtedly great, beyond imagination. This was not the dwelling of a Dragon Gate realm cultivator but an entire sect. Just judging by the scale of the buildings, it was not at all inferior to Yunshang City or Caique's mansion. 

Thus, when the city lord Shen Zhenze handed him that small object, it was the perfect decision. 

What worried him was that this fairy mansion could not be taken away. If it were truly the cultivation ground of a Yuan Ying Earth Immortal or even a top five realm cultivator, once they returned to Yunshang City, as long as there was a hint of news leaked out, when they came back for treasure hunting, it was likely that not a single Golden Core would be able to salvage even a bit of the leftovers. They would only be taken by the sect closest to them, using the legendary mountain-moving divine ability to relocate it. 

The sects nearest to Beiting country, one to the west and one to the north, were not far from here. That slight difference would be negligible for sect cultivators who had their own boats. 

This old cultivator could only hope that the former owners of this place were merely nameless Earth Immortals, and that their realms were not too high. 

The best would be Golden Core; having a Yuan Ying would be troublesome, making follow-up difficult. 

It was possible that a ledger cleric from a sect background would visit Yunshang City without needing to exchange words, and the city lord would have to surrender most of the juicy bits, complying with their demands and still worry about their dissatisfaction. 

If a top five realm cultivator were to take residence in the mountain's ruins, there would be no hope left; it would certainly be a case of fortune and calamity coexisting. 

Unless they could immediately shatter this small world and destroy all traces of it in one go. 

Unfortunately, Yunshang City could not do that. 

Unless Shen Zhenze acted decisively, after their return to Yunshang City with Huan Yun, actively reaching out to one of the sects to negotiate a fair division. 

As for this place, with its dense water energy and so many impressive buildings, it would naturally become a summer retreat for that sect in the future. 

The spirit artifact meant to scout ahead flew freely without obstruction. 

The old cultivator felt reassured and soared into the air. 

Just as the old cultivator reached several hundred zhang above the ground, the spirit artifact shattered with a loud bang. The old cultivator sensed something was amiss and was suddenly yanked downwards toward the ground. 

With a jolt, the old cultivator relaxed; it was merely the old Daoist Huan Yun who had pressed down on his shoulder, carrying him down to the ground. 

Then, the old cultivator noticed a thin thread of aura above his head flicker by in an instant, vanishing without a trace. 

Huan Yun said in a deep voice, "I advise you not to go further up. Even Golden Core Earth Immortal martial artists cannot withstand that thread of sword qi patrolling the area." 

Earlier, the old Daoist had sent several patrol talismans into the sky, only to find that whenever a talisman ascended, it would instantly disintegrate into powder. 

The old cultivator looked up; the earlier aura had already vanished without a trace. 

The Dragon Gate realm cultivator from Yunshang City was shocked. “Could it be that there's a sword immortal guarding this ruin?!” 

Huan Yun, who had quietly circled around the green mountain, shook his head. “All are dead; there are no living beings or ghostly entities left. Only this sword qi continues to exist in this small world.” 

Huan Yun’s expression turned grave. “Let me tell you a piece of good and bad news: this place is an ancient cave heaven that shattered, leaving behind a mysterious region, roughly a hundred miles in radius. The age of this small world is hard to say; it could be a thousand years or even older. However, I estimate that this mountain cave's existence quietly perished around seven to eight hundred years ago, which is strange because there has never been a sect like this in Beiting's history.” 

Huan Yun halted his descent, hovering a hundred zhang above the ground, maintaining a wind barrier with the old cultivator, and slowly said, “This leaves only one possibility: this small world was carried here after the sect perished, unknown to the world. For some reason, this immortal could neither occupy this secret realm nor cultivate smoothly. Perhaps they suffered misfortune, and the treasure capable of carrying this small world fell unnoticed into the deep mountains of Beiting. Or perhaps this person, upon reaching Beiting, no longer traveled far, hiding here to quietly cultivate, eventually fading into obscurity and reincarnating.” 

Huan Yun sighed, “Life and death are uncertain; the great path is unpredictable.” 

Each time he contemplated this matter, it inevitably left him somewhat disheartened. 

But after his moment of reflection, Huan Yun suddenly snapped back to reality, remembering the words he had said to Shen Zhenze in Yunshang City, and quickly returned to normal, with no shadow of gloom in his heart. 

Daoist cultivation, self-deception leads to others’ deception; thus, it has become the most difficult hurdle to overcome among the three teachings and a hundred schools. 

The old Daoist Huan Yun was indeed gifted, but all the Earth Immortals along the great river of the North Continent believed that Huan Yun had a bright future in the realm of talismans, aligning with his own great path, leading to his current success. 

Yet Huan Yun understood, this was akin to a mute eating bitter herbs, unable to express his sorrows. 

Once, a great figure had stated that had Huan Yun entered a sect early on, and not learned those intricate talisman tricks, he would have long since been a Yuan Ying cultivator with the potential to reach the top five realms.

Thus, regarding the matters of gains and losses, Huan Yun felt deeply affected. 

In times of helplessness, the only thing he could do was treat it as a practice of his Daoist heart to ease his worries. 

At the peak, the Daoist temple housed a statue of a middle-aged Daoist sitting in a meditative posture, gazing forward with his palms placed together in front of him. 

On the incense table was a small brass incense burner, still containing half a furnace of ash. 

Everyone knew that this shining little incense burner was undoubtedly a crucial artifact of the Daoist sect, yet no one dared to touch it. 

Di Yuanfeng quietly asked, “Sun Daoren, have you seen this person’s likeness in your sect's statue register?” 

Sun Daoren shook his head, “Never seen him.” 

There was something he didn’t dare to say aloud; this Daoist’s appearance was unremarkable, and the entire statue gave an impression of being plain and ordinary, not even as shocking as the four celestial king statues in the cave chamber. 

Chen Ping'an observed the statue, recalling the time he traveled with an old Daoist from the East Sea Temple in the flowing waters of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land for over three hundred years. Occasionally, he would see the old temple master appear in a similar sitting posture, though it was rare. Perhaps to ordinary people, this posture seemed unremarkable, but Chen Ping'an had a vague feeling that there was a resemblance between the old temple master's true Daoist essence and this middle-aged Daoist’s statue. 

Chen Ping'an remembered four characters from a Daoist classic. 

“Leaving the Realm, Sitting in Forgetfulness.” 

Time flows ever onward. 

The cultivators are unaware of the changes in seasons below the mountain; the departed leave only a statue, no matter how profound their Daoist skills were in life, what does it matter? Do they not know how the seasons change? 

In the end, how high can a Daoist ascend through their cultivation? 

Chen Ping'an sighed internally, taking out three incense sticks from his possessions. After igniting them, he placed them in the small incense burner. 

Sun Daoren thought this Daoist friend was being overly idealistic, did he really hope that the statue would still have a remnant of its essence just because he lit three incense sticks? 

Master Huang and Di Yuanfeng did not stop this person from lighting the incense. 

In fact, they were more curious to see if the black-robed elder's reckless act of burning incense would trigger any mechanisms or bring about opportunities, or perhaps cause a deadly mishap. 

After all, the little incense burner was something they would definitely take with them; having someone willing to take risks to explore was even better. 

When the three incense sticks had burned down with no response, Di Yuanfeng laughed, saying, “Brother Huang has already obtained a magical robe, and I’ve acquired two ornaments; so what does that leave for this incense burner? Sun Daoist or Brother Chen?” 

Chen Ping'an smiled, “I’ll pass. There are so many buildings in the mountain that I haven’t explored, and after we split up, I’ll have enough to keep me busy. If Sun Daoist wants the incense burner, feel free to take it.” 

Master Huang said, “I can exchange that magical robe for the incense burner with Sun Daoist.” 

Sun Daoren felt a pang of regret but still nodded in agreement. 

Master Huang tossed the magical robe, then went to pick up the incense burner and put it in his pack. 

He then cleared out the worthless clothes and jars from his large bag, tossing them casually on the ground. 

Then he tore the bag in half, giving one half to Di Yuanfeng as a makeshift carry-all, casting a glance at Sun Daoren, who looked awkward. “Sun Daoist, with such a large robe on, wouldn’t taking it off just turn it into a bag?” 

Sun Daoren suddenly realized, feeling delighted. 

The four of them busied themselves within the small Daoist temple. Di Yuanfeng found a pristine white mat, while Sun Daoren tore off several pieces of unknown golden silk fabric. 

Master Huang speculated that there might be secrets hidden within the statue, so he suddenly struck the entire statue with a punch, only to yield nothing. 

At that moment, Chen Ping'an was crouched on the ground, pressing his hand against the damp blue bricks, knocking and tapping. Just as he was formulating a plan, he heard the commotion and looked up at Master Huang, who smiled broadly at him.

Sun Daoren was startled, while Di Yuanfeng merely glanced at the shattered statue on the ground, which was merely the least valuable painted wood, before losing interest in it. 

The four stepped out of the Daoist temple, and just as Sun Daoren crossed the threshold, a series of explosive sounds erupted from his waist. 

It turned out that the pagoda bell had exploded. 

Sun Daoren wailed, “This is terrible! It must be our disrespect that has angered this Daoist immortal!” 

Master Huang and Di Yuanfeng exchanged glances, without any hesitation, descending the mountain to search for treasures in other buildings. 

Sun Daoren hesitated for a moment, choosing not to follow Di Yuanfeng but instead rushing after Master Huang while shouting for him to wait, dashing forward. 

Soon, the small Daoist temple behind them collapsed with a thunderous crash, sending dust flying and shrouding the sky. 

Chen Ping'an, however, did not hurry down the mountain like the others. 

Instead, he began to collect items that the other three were unwilling to take. 

For instance, the heavy, space-consuming green glazed tiles, as well as the blue bricks that contained rich water energy. 

Aside from the bag he slung over his shoulder, Chen Ping'an also had the small and inch-sized objects. 

He had cleared out a lot of space in his shop in Chunlu Garden on Old Huai Street. 

Yet what Chen Ping'an truly wanted to collect was the broken wood from the statue that Master Huang had smashed. 

In the ruins of the Daoist temple, Chen Ping'an moved at a steady pace. 

He carefully gathered the shimmering glazed tiles, while simultaneously tossing aside the odds and ends among the ruins of the temple, meticulously selecting the broken wood from the statue, searching for fragments while loading the glazed tiles. 

It was said that the Glazed Pavilion in Baidi City had specially crafted blue tiles, layered upon the rooftops, earning the reputation of “The glazed tiles on the Glazed Pavilion reflect the clouds like azure waves.” 

After collecting all the broken wood from the statue, Chen Ping'an also loaded one hundred and twenty glazed tiles, causing him to feel somewhat peculiar. 

One, looking up, it seemed as if he had moved the temple ruins to a different spot, from the original site to the white jade plaza. 

Moreover, those blue bricks, imbued with strands of water energy rather than ordinary spiritual energy, left Chen Ping'an in a dilemma. 

To completely collect the glazed tiles from the temple roof and the blue bricks on the ground, it would seem impossible even with more inch-sized objects. 

However, regarding this, Chen Ping'an felt no hesitation. 

Instead, among the inch-sized objects, he placed some old and worthless items. 

Compared to the blue bricks infused with strands of water energy, or the other opportunities and treasures awaiting him in the various halls and pavilions, they were worlds apart. 

Chen Ping'an squatted on the spot, hands tucked in his sleeves. 

He looked up, stroked his chin, and stood back up, trying to carry more blue bricks and glazed tiles. 

Not a single old object among the inch-sized items was discarded. 

Finally, Chen Ping'an lit three more incense sticks and inserted them into the crevices between the blue bricks of the temple ruins. 

Once they had burned down completely, he lightly blew a breath, scattering some ash. 

When digging up the blue bricks, Chen Ping'an worked methodically, ensuring no erratic digging left visible traces on the ground. 

Ultimately, he didn’t overlook even the inch-sized objects, collecting over thirty blue bricks alongside them. 

After some thought, Chen Ping'an stuffed another blue brick and two glazed tiles into his slung pack, feeling the weight was quite reassuring. 

Then he descended the mountain. 

To see his kind-hearted friend, Sun Daoren. 

If nothing unexpected occurred, once this Sun Daoist found something that would make even Master Huang drool with envy, it would likely be the moment of his demise. 

Before Sun Daoist had called out for Master Huang, he had actually sent a mental warning to Chen Ping'an: "Be very careful of Qin Juyuan; it’s best if he doesn’t show up again. Take this opportunity to grab the treasures and run as far as you can; life is worth more than money!" 

Chen Ping'an felt that just this piece of advice could spare Sun Daoist from an unforeseen calamity. 

This treasure hunting trip had already yielded far beyond Chen Ping'an's expectations, enough to make him smile awake from his dreams. 

So next, it would just be a journey through the mountains and rivers. 

If he happened to gain more, that would be splendid; if not, that was fine too. 

However, the sudden shattering of Sun Daoren's pagoda bell was quite strange. 

Yet compared to the oddities of this cave, it was no longer astonishing. 

Even though Chen Ping'an had just lit another Yang Energy Lantern Talisman, there remained signs of clarity and purity in the surroundings, devoid of any malevolent energy. 

Chen Ping'an was at a loss. 

Just like dealing with soldiers, he would face water and earth as they came. 

Many disasters and calamities were merely human misfortunes. 

Chen Ping'an circled around the mountain, passing the pile of ruined temple rubble in the white jade plaza. His prior actions of rummaging were meticulous, and his techniques were clever; he wouldn’t overlook anything. 

If he did miss something, there was no need for further worry. 

Standing at the top of the steps, he looked out. 

Finally, the second wave of people had arrived. 

Compared to the first wave’s stealthy approach, this group was much more swaggering. 

It was the young lord of Beiting, Zhan Qing, along with Bai Bi, the direct disciple of the Water Dragon Sect from the Huqi Kingdom. 

Chen Ping'an affixed a talisman to himself, gliding down like a bird. 

(End of chapter)

 ### Chapter 641: Winding Paths, Wild Practitioners

Sun Daoren followed Huang Shi as they searched for treasures, and they were quite successful in their endeavors.

The two of them had a decent rapport, parting ways to explore but not straying too far from one another. Sun Daoren was anxious about getting too far from Huang Shi, fearing that if he encountered danger, his meager skills would leave him helpless. Huang Shi, on the other hand, was wary of this slender, proactive Daoist; he didn’t want him to run off with a prized treasure.

In a two-story pavilion, Sun Daoren found many valuable books reduced to ashes, but he managed to uncover a Daoist manual that he couldn’t open or browse. It still exuded a radiant glow of multicolored light, and even when wrapped in a Daoist robe, its brilliance overflowed. The ancient golden characters inscribed in obscure scripts were entirely unfamiliar to him. Only those with a lineage and the qualifications as celestial masters could access such long-lost ancient texts.

After reuniting with Huang Shi, Sun Daoren felt a bit awkward; the treasure was too impressive, and that also brought trouble.

Huang Shi smiled, pretending not to notice.

Sun Daoren asked, "Did you find anything good, Brother Huang?"

Huang Shi nodded. "Not bad."

The two separated again, each seeking other rare materials and celestial artifacts.

Huang Shi took his time moving, glancing back at the slender Daoist’s silhouette, his smile deepening.

Earlier, in a small pavilion, Huang Shi had seen two skeletons seated at a stone table, their hands engaged in a game of chess. The table was engraved with a chessboard, featuring a mere seventeen lines, indicating that the game was in its concluding phase. Huang Shi had no interest in chess; he merely noted that the numerous pieces on the board indicated that both players were close to victory. Unfortunately, he couldn't be bothered to study the board any further.

Within the small pavilion, Huang Shi not only obtained two robes but also acquired those two jars of chess pieces. The pieces had a natural arc to them. Huang Shi couldn’t discern their material, but under the light, the translucent white pieces appeared with a faint golden hue, while the black pieces were opaque in the center, creating a rippling emerald halo in the light. Anyone not blind could see the value of these chess pieces.

The two robes were heavily worn, but the jars of chess pieces instead benefitted from time, much like ordinary stones that had soaked in mountain streams for centuries, becoming increasingly delicate and smooth, much to his delight.

As Huang Shi collected the black and white pieces from the stone chessboard, the white pieces felt scorching hot, as if burning his soul, while the black pieces were freezing cold. After swiftly tossing two pieces into the jar, he noticed that his fingers bore no injuries. His heart surged with joy; these jars were undoubtedly magical treasures. Ordinary spiritual weapons might injure a Gold Body realm warrior, but they wouldn’t disturb Huang Shi’s soul. Yet, merely picking up those pieces made him reluctant to hold them for long.

From this, Huang Shi deduced that the stone table, which had preserved the chess game for centuries, must be a celestial artifact; otherwise, the pieces wouldn’t have sat undisturbed for so long, with the board remaining intact.

However, Huang Shi had no intention of running around carrying a stone table.

He had considered destroying the table, thinking that if he couldn’t obtain it, neither would anyone else. But when he struck down with his palm, the table didn’t budge at all. It seemed like it could withstand force, only deepening Huang Shi’s regret at not being able to take it with him. If he could combine it with the two jars, it would fetch a sky-high price.

Meanwhile, Chen Ping’an quietly appeared near the pavilion. The chessboard’s spiritual energy still rippled with faint golden and emerald colors, possibly because the pieces had been embedded in the board for too long, seeping into the stone. Chen Ping’an swept his gaze over the residual spiritual aura of the chess pieces, closed his eyes, and silently memorized the game. After he opened his eyes, he thought that a good memory was not as reliable as a poor pen, so he took out some paper and a pen from his bag to record the ancient chess game.

The chessboard had only seventeen lines, unlike the widely popular nineteen lines, which itself was a clue. The various opening formations and life-and-death moves could reveal heavenly secrets.

Huang Shi, a martial artist, was utterly indifferent to these subtle clues. Chen Ping’an, however, was attentive and focused, yet he couldn’t hope to deduce the rough timeline of the game like Lu Tai or Cui Dongshan could with just a glance.

Chen Ping’an envied the mountain’s magic that allowed practitioners to observe the world from their sleeves.

Both techniques, “Observing Mountains in Hand” and “Sleeve Universe,” were the most desired skills for him to master.

Yet, these two superior techniques were only barely graspable by Golden Core earthly immortals, and to truly master them, one would need to reach the fifth realm.

Chen Ping’an considered the pavilion a prime location for cultivating Qi, as the two jars of chess pieces were rich in spiritual energy, having remained undisturbed over the years. It was much less conspicuous than the ruins of the Daoist temple paved with green bricks.

The spiritual energy here was thick, an opportunity not to be missed.

Chen Ping’an set down his bag on the table, removed his extravagant hundred-eyed robe, first putting on the highest quality golden robe, followed by the snowflake robe he had acquired from a female ghost in the greasy city. Finally, he donned the black robe again. With all three robes on, he could absorb and store more water spiritual energy.

Chen Ping’an took to the pavilion, crossed his legs, and, using the Toad Stone talisman, regulated his breathing, becoming as still as a mountain, trying to keep track of the movements of his companions Huang Shi and Sun Daoren.

From the pavilion, the chessboard’s spiritual energy, now infused with faint golden and emerald hues, slowly gathered towards the pavilion’s ceiling, gradually seeping into Chen Ping’an’s robes.

This illustrated just how precious the chessboard's spiritual energy was.

With Chen Ping’an’s deliberate guidance, the golden robe was the first to become saturated, absorbing about seventy to eighty percent of the water spiritual energy that had lingered in the pavilion due to the chess pieces. It had reached a level comparable to that of the abundant spiritual energy found in other halls. Chen Ping’an hesitated, opting not to drain this place completely dry to avoid revealing any signs. Taking everything would be tempting fate; after all, the real test lay ahead with all the celestial beings ascending the mountain, bringing with them layers of intrigue.

If there’s a chance to save some luck, then why not hold onto a bit? 

Ultimately, a momentary lack of profit was intended for long-term gain.

Once the situation was settled, they could discuss gains and losses.

Chen Ping’an then altered his strategy, no longer tailing Huang Shi but instead quietly following Sun Daoren.

If before obtaining that manual, Sun Daoren had been focused on tracking Huang Shi, now it seemed that even if Sun Daoren wanted to slip away, Huang Shi wouldn’t let him succeed.

This mountain, not being a true temple, had its central axis defined by the white jade steps leading from the mountain gate to the summit. 

It resembled a celestial sect without a clear inclination toward any of the three teachings. What puzzled Chen Ping’an most was that this mountain lacked a Hall of Patriarchs.

Especially on the mountainside, there were scattered huts and grand halls, all in a disordered jumble, lacking any apparent structure.

After entering and exiting various buildings, Sun Daoren intentionally distanced himself from Huang Shi, now no longer swaggering through the corridors but rather sneaking along, trying to conceal his presence.

Eventually, he hid in a small, exquisite secluded hall with a broken plaque that faintly read “Water Hall.”

The hall housed a statue of a female deity, adorned with fluttering ribbons, exuding an ethereal aura.

Sun Daoren used his robe to wrap various treasures he had collected as he moved through the corridors. He gathered everything that hadn’t turned to ashes—antique items and literary treasures—all stuffed into his bag, slung over his shoulder. He was laden with spoils, but the prerequisite was to leave this celestial mansion alive.

Sun Daoren closed the hall door, but after a moment’s thought, he remembered that the other buildings he had passed seemed to be left open. Hesitating, he quietly reopened the hall door to avoid raising any suspicions with Huang Shi.

From his vantage point on a roof ridge, Chen Ping’an watched anxiously, feeling for Sun Daoren. This was akin to stealing silver and placing a wooden plaque, indirectly telling Huang Shi, “Sun Daoren didn’t steal any money.” It would have been better for Sun Daoren to move about more, opening more doors to create the illusion of having crossed the central axis of the steps, fleeing towards Prince Qin of Jiayou Country. Otherwise, if he remained here, Huang Shi, if he had any sense at all, would surely begin his search from this small hall. If it were Chen Ping’an, he would have made sure to open or close those doors from the very start.

However, as he had been sneaking along, Sun Daoren often had to make choices, discarding items from his bags, unsure whether the new treasures or the old ones were more valuable. He finally relied solely on his instincts.

Chen Ping’an was left to pick through the discarded items.

In contrast, Huang Shi, if he found that his bag was becoming too full, would simply smash unwanted items with a punch. If he couldn’t break them, he would have other tricks, likely needing to replace them entirely.

Most of the treasures left behind by celestial beings were already on the verge of breaking. Repairing them would likely require a substantial amount of celestial money, but Huang Shi, with his solid foundation as a Gold Body realm warrior, could easily smash them. Items he had initially intended to discard, if they didn’t break with a single punch, would certainly be added to his collection.

This illustrated the immense opportunity of this treasure hunt on the mountain.

For ordinary celestial caves coming back to light, a group of wild practitioners battling against one another would typically yield three to four celestial artifacts per person, which would be enough to make anyone ecstatic.

Yet Huang Shi remained unsatisfied.

As expected, after suddenly losing track of Sun Daoren, he began to abandon his search, hastily making his way back following the route he had taken to find this small hall.

As Huang Shi approached, Chen Ping’an ceased his sitting position, lying flat on the ridge, holding his breath, completely still.

Huang Shi glanced at the plaque on the ground and smiled, “Sun Daoren, are there more treasures inside the Water Hall? How about I lend you a hand? Don’t worry, according to our earlier agreement, whoever opens the door first gets to keep all the treasures inside, no matter how valuable.”

Inside the Water Hall, Sun Daoren trembled, silently praying to the Three Pure Ones to have Huang Shi leave quickly.

Perhaps because Sun Daoren was not a disciple of the Daoist sect's three branches, his prayers were in vain, as Huang Shi directly stepped over the threshold, smiling, “Sun Daoren, what’s this? Have you gotten some treasures and turned your back on me, even fearing your ally? Shouldn’t we be worried about that Di Yuanfeng, who wields a deadly weapon? Does a fifth realm warrior like me truly frighten you so?”

With no way to escape, Sun Daoren had no choice but to step out from behind the statue, forcing a smile, “Brother Huang is joking.”

Huang Shi teased, “We’ve only covered a fraction of this celestial mansion; there’s still so much more to explore. Not to mention, we discovered a great view in the back mountain earlier. Why did you abandon that robe so early? You know it’s bad luck to walk back after burning incense in a temple.”

Sun Daoren had to retrace his steps, picking up the package he had carefully set on the ground behind the statue, slinging it over his shoulder, forehead glistening with sweat. “Brother Huang, how about we join forces and keep an eye on that Di Yuanfeng? Wouldn’t that be better? If we end up quarreling, we’d only be giving Di Yuanfeng the advantage.”

Huang Shi nodded, “How about you let me take a look at that radiant robe’s manual?”

Sun Daoren sighed, “Brother Huang, you’ve already got that incense burner. Shouldn’t you know when to stop? Besides, this manual is a Daoist classic; it wouldn’t mean much to you.”

Huang Shi smiled, “Whether it means anything or not is up to you, Sun Daoren.”

Sun Daoren’s expression darkened, “Huang Shi, allow me to give you some advice too. I’m quite adept at close combat as a sea-watching realm Daoist.”

Huang Shi said, “If not for that, it would be a problem. I know your trump card is that broken bell that you use for defense. Unfortunately, it’s gone now. Aside from that, you have just an offensive piece of your life’s essence. Do you know who I really am? I’m actually a sixth realm warrior; it wouldn’t take more than a couple of punches to take you down.”

Sun Daoren was shocked, “A sixth realm warrior?!”

He quickly scoffed, “Anyone can scare people! I could claim to be a Golden Core earthly immortal; would you be afraid?”

Just then, Huang Shi was about to deliver a punch to end this old Daoist’s life when a sudden sound of footsteps approached from outside the Water Hall. Huang Shi turned to look, only to find a black-robed elder, Chen Dao, who hadn’t gone to seek treasures with Di Yuanfeng.

Huang Shi cast a glance at the shabby bag slung across the elder’s shoulder, which seemed to contain some glazed tiles and… a few pieces of Daoist temple green bricks?

Was it a lack of courage, or just bad luck? 

After all this time, had he really just crashed into the gates of death without any other gains?

If that were the case, Huang Shi felt it would be a waste of effort to kill such a pitiful creature.

Sun Daoren saw the hurriedly arriving Daoist and felt both delighted and helpless.

This Chen Dao had not heeded his warnings. Nevertheless, now that it had come to this, he would see if there was an opportunity to team up against Huang Shi, to prevent him from monopolizing the treasures they had both worked hard to find.

Seeing that shabby bag on the elder’s shoulder, Sun Daoren thought that if things went south, the two of them could escape together, gifting Chen Dao a few seemingly worthless treasures.

Chen Ping’an wiped the sweat from his forehead, “I’ve been searching for you both. I was just flying around the rooftops and saw two groups of people heading up the mountain. I quickly landed. The first group was two young disciples, clearly celestial masters we can’t afford to provoke, all wearing robes. The second was that little Marquis from Beiting Country, accompanied by five others. One person guarded the bridge at the foot of the mountain, while another rushed directly to the mountaintop Daoist temple, clearly aiming to occupy the vital passage. The remaining three were slowly searching their way up the mountain, and it’s only a matter of time before we run into them. What should we do?”

Huang Shi’s mood darkened.

The dilapidated pavilion by the winding path was home to two pure martial artists, both of whom were true masters. Facing the two alone would require him to fight desperately.

With three others joining, Huang Shi felt he couldn’t confidently escape with treasures in hand.

Thus, the situation had changed; both companions inside and outside the Water Hall couldn’t be killed for the time being.

So Huang Shi smiled, “Just joking with Sun Daoren; don’t take offense.”

Sun Daoren huffed, “Brother Huang, such hurtful jokes are best avoided!”

Huang Shi felt an anger bubbling inside, nearly losing control and striking down this old Daoist. After all, this so-called close-combat wild practitioner was far less threatening than the black-robed elder adept in talismans. Should he kill Sun Daoren, all treasures could be left temporarily in the hands of the black-robed elder, and Huang Shi didn’t believe Chen Dao wouldn’t be tempted!

Suddenly, Sun Daoren raised his voice, “Chen Dao, can we negotiate? Could you spare me a few attack talismans?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Sure, let’s make a deal.”

Sun Daoren fell silent.

Huang Shi frowned, then relaxed, nearly forgetting that Sun Daoren was a half-hearted Daoist practitioner; drawing talismans wasn’t too difficult for him.

This wasn’t bad news. With both Sun Daoren and the black-robed elder wielding attack talismans, coupled with his own strength as a Gold Body realm warrior, and meeting Di Yuanfeng, the four of them would pose a formidable force.

Huang Shi stepped out of the Water Hall, making way for the black-robed elder, who had already halted, standing to the side while casting a sidelong glance at the two frail Qi practitioners. “Whether we can seize this opportunity depends on our willingness to cooperate in earnest. Let me be clear: I, Huang Shi, am a sixth realm warrior, not just boasting. If it comes to combat, I won’t hold back. However, once we leave this place, in return, you both need to grant me an opportunity.”

Chen Ping’an clapped his bag, revealing the outline of the green bricks. “Take what you want.”

Huang Shi felt his eyelids twitch.

Sun Daoren gritted his teeth, “Aside from the Daoist manual, feel free to take anything else from my bags!”

Huang Shi hesitated, then nodded. “It’s a deal!”

Chen Ping’an stepped over the threshold, meeting Sun Daoren’s gaze. Without needing to exchange words, they both approached the statue in the Water Hall.

They crouched down, and Sun Daoren asked, “How many types of attack talismans do you have, Chen Dao?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Three types. Aside from the most valuable one, the Thunder Talisman, I have the River Severing Talisman and the Mountain Constraining Talisman. Just by their names, you can guess they’re all precious talismans. As for how many…”

Sun Daoren, sensing Chen Ping’an’s hesitation, grew impatient and firmly stated, “Aside from that Thunder Talisman, keep it for your own protection. I’ll take all the others!”

Chen Ping’an was still unsure. “Sun Daoren, do you have enough celestial money? These precious defense talismans are worth quite a bit, and I’ll be heartbroken to part with them.”

Sun Daoren asked, “Didn’t you say you drew these talismans yourself?”

Chen Ping’an answered, “Do you really believe that? If I could draw such deadly talismans myself, why would I be a wild practitioner struggling at the mountain’s base? I’d be serving in a top celestial sect like Caijue Mansion or Yuncheng, living a life of comfort instead.”

Sun Daoren grimaced, rubbing his cheek. “Chen Dao, just tell me how many talismans you have left. I’ll buy them all.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “Sun Daoren, you may be a senior, but business is business. First, you need to show me the celestial money.”

Sun Daoren grumbled, “Chen Dao, you should be fair in business!”

Chen Ping’an retorted, “Sun Daoren, fairness is essential in transactions!”

Sun Daoren felt disheartened. Damn, this Chen Dao was harder to deceive than he thought.

After some hesitation, he opened his robe package and laid it on the ground, saying seriously, “I’ll buy six talismans, three of each Water and Earth, and you can pick a priceless treasure from the mountain.”

Chen Ping’an rummaged through his sleeve and produced two ordinary yellow paper talismans, twisting the talismans with one hand while the other hand began to search around, stating, “For these two talismans, I’ll trade one for a broken celestial artifact.”

Sun Daoren’s face turned dark, and he was about to roll up his package.

Chen Ping’an then placed those two talismans at the edge of the package, saying, “Once I pick a treasure, I’ll hand over two talismans.”

Sun Daoren conceded, “Chen Dao, this deal is too much of a loss for me.”

Chen Ping’an eyed the twenty-odd celestial artifacts, his gaze wavering, thoroughly examining each one while grumbling, “Sun Daoren, since you hail from Yinger Mountain, the Thunder God’s abode, why didn’t you bring down a few Thunder talismans? Relying on your status as a celestial master, you’ve acted too presumptuously. Now you’re blaming me?”

Sun Daoren recalled his identity as a celestial master and chuckled, stroking his beard. “There are countless unexpected events when traveling down the mountain. How can one predict every detail? If I could foresee everything, I wouldn’t need to descend the mountain to strengthen my resolve.”

Chen Ping’an nodded and continued his selection.

Among the first two items he liked, one was ideal for gifting, while the rank of the other didn’t concern him too much. 

It could be given to Li Huai.

It was a wooden statue of a deity, palm-sized, depicting the Daoist Yuanjun, resembling the female statue in the Water Hall. The figure was graceful and elegant, with fine fingers performing magical gestures, a serene expression on her face, wearing a delicate crown, and dressed in exquisite robes that flowed down to the seat.

The base bore twelve characters in small, elegant script, promising clarity within and protection from external devilish distractions.

Chen Ping’an thought it had good symbolism.

There was also an ancient, round fan that looked quite valuable, likely to attract the attention of customers in his future shop on Old Huai Street or at the Bagua Zhai shop in Niujiao Mountain. After all, women in the world loved to shop, often more so than men, and as long as they liked it, reasoning and quality mattered little.

The last item was the most shocking one.

To be precise, it was overwhelming.

It was a pair of bamboo cages, drawn together by golden silk threads, with a greenish bamboo color, vibrant and glistening. However, like the other items, they had many fine cracks, greatly diminishing their appearance. Each cage was fist-sized, resembling common cricket cages, with inscriptions reading “Fight the Jiao” and “Submerge the Pans.”

Seeing these, Chen Ping’an broke out in a cold sweat.

He felt a bit nervous.

He was convinced that if there was a chance, he must team up with Sun Daoren to explore mountains and seek treasures.

Sun Daoren noticed something was off, sensing this was bound to be a lucrative deal. Why did Chen Dao seem so awkward? Was he suddenly realizing that despite the value of the items in his bag, they were still inferior to talismans? Having an extra talisman meant an extra chance at survival? This made Sun Daoren sweat as well, wanting to stealthily snatch the two talismans. He thought, “Brother Chen, we’ve built a bond; two talismans should suffice.” Sun Daoren rolled the talismans into his sleeve, letting out a sigh of relief. Just when he was about to say the remaining two could be forgotten…

Unexpectedly, Chen Dao took the fan, sticking to their agreement, and produced two Water and Earth talismans from his sleeve, handing them to Sun Daoren.

Then he removed the bag slung over his shoulder, pulled out a folded package from among the glazed tiles and green bricks, shook it lightly, and placed the fan inside.

Sun Daoren felt astonished and envious, realizing Chen Dao carried so many blue cloth packages, a true veteran of the trade.

Chen Ping’an then pulled out four talismans, laying them next to Sun Daoren’s robe on the ground, and stored the wooden statue inside his bag.

Sun Daoren was in high spirits, smiling broadly, “Chen Dao, you’ve even got four more talismans? Feel free to choose from the treasures on the ground, take your time.”

Chen Ping’an hesitated, dragging his feet, but ultimately pulled out a stack of over twenty talismans, among which were three golden talismans, likely the prized ones!

Sun Daoren looked at the stack tightly clutched in Chen Ping’an’s hand, glancing down to assess.

These were likely the last of Chen Dao’s talisman stash.

Sun Daoren swallowed hard, reminding himself to remain calm and composed, yet his smile remained stiff. He tentatively asked, “Chen Dao, do you have your eye on anything else? Good things come in pairs; I’d be willing to buy one more in exchange for four attack talismans.”

The black-robed elder laughed in disbelief, “Sun Daoren has good taste!”

Sun Daoren stroked his beard, chuckling, “Fair business is the way to go. If you let this opportunity pass, Chen Dao, you should think twice and cherish the rare bond we share.”

The other party was still indecisive.

Outside the Water Hall, Huang Shi urged impatiently, “Are you two planning to spend a few days inside this hall?”

Finally, the black-robed elder handed Sun Daoren two golden talismans, only one of which was the Thunder Talisman, while the other was a Mountain Breaking Talisman.

However, Sun Daoren was satisfied, merely teasing Chen Dao for being stingy.

Among the remaining stack of talismans, only one golden talisman remained, presumably the elder’s last prized attack talisman. Yet Sun Daoren didn’t press the issue, at least giving him a chance to keep one for self-defense.

This way, Sun Daoren felt more assured that this Chen Dao, who claimed to come from a small Daoist temple in Wuling Country, wasn’t a master of talisman drawing after all.

Chen Ping’an took the pair of bamboo cages that Sun Daoren couldn’t identify and was about to grab another item when Sun Daoren cheerfully folded his package, slinging it over his shoulder.

As the two crossed the threshold of the Water Hall, Huang Shi’s expression soured. “There’s been some commotion on the other side of the steps; I wonder who ran into whom.”

Now three groups of people were mixed together on the mountain.

The four of them should have been the first to enter the mansion’s secret realm.

Huang Shi was unaware of the two young disciples from the Yunshang City sect; he didn’t know who they were, but they likely belonged to Yunshang City, as Cai Que Mansion had only female cultivators.

The third group presented the biggest challenge.

So the best-case scenario would be for the two young disciples from the Yunshang City sect to clash with the little Marquis from Beiting Country.

If Di Yuanfeng were to engage someone first, it would not bode well.

Given Di Yuanfeng’s character, if he encountered danger, he would surely drag Huang Shi and the others into it, leading to their demise together on the road to the underworld.

Huang Shi suddenly leaped onto the roof, witnessing figures falling from the rafters like dumplings into boiling water, numbering over forty. It seemed more would soon follow.

The commotion was far greater than the sporadic sounds of fighting on the other side of the steps.

Huang Shi found himself puzzled; in such a chaotic situation, the odds seemed to favor him.

As long as he found an escape route and seized Sun Daoren’s manual, he could leave without a second thought.

He was a pure warrior, with no particular attachment to the spiritual energy of this place.

The ensuing chaos among everyone else was their own struggle, irrelevant to him.

Huang Shi said, “We won’t take the mountain steps but will take the longer route to the back mountain.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Shouldn’t we wait for Prince Qin?”

Sun Daoren sighed, thinking that this young man was truly naive to the dangers of the world.

Having exchanged items inside the Water Hall, Sun Daoren had already sensed Chen Dao’s cautiousness, which was actually quite frivolous and unreliable.

Huang Shi smiled, “Brother Chen can go greet Prince Qin while Sun Daoren and I wait here.”

Sun Daoren noticed the awkward expression on Chen Dao’s face and ceased to speak.

Sun Daoren quietly conveyed through his thoughts, “Chen Dao, remember, too much talk can lead to mistakes. Once we’re in the treasure trove, take what you can and don’t overplay your hand. Who knows, Prince Qin might have already found a great fortune; he may not even wish to see you. If you go over, wouldn’t that put him in a difficult position?”

Chen Ping’an replied with a smile, “As expected of Sun Daoren, wise and steady.”

At this moment, Chen Ping’an’s best plan was to find an outsider to confirm the flow of time in this small realm. If it wouldn’t delay his journey along the great river, he could linger here for a bit longer, hoping to avoid any conflicts with the various celestial beings and allowing him to cultivate safely, gathering spiritual energy from the Water Hall and the Mountain Shrine.

He aimed to absorb as much of the essence of the water energy contained in the Daoist temple’s green bricks as possible.

The Water Hall and the Mountain Shrine had limited spiritual energy reserves; as for other energy realms, due to the existence of pure true energy, they couldn’t hold much. Combined, they likely would not be as effective as the energy gathered in a hundred-eyed gluttonous robe. However, even if the spiritual energy at the Water Hall and Mountain Shrine overflowed, it wouldn't matter, as Chen Ping’an could draw talismans here.

Using the best celestial dan shan from Chunlu Garden to draw talismans on golden material, consuming as much spiritual energy as possible would enhance the rank of the talismans.

Cultivating Qi, studying talismans, and earning celestial money would be a win-win situation.

Chen Ping’an even planned to use this spiritual energy to attempt to open a third crucial energy point, making way for his future third life essence artifact of the wood element.

He had an intuition that the wood-based life essence artifact had already found its place.

From another perspective, being in this small world was not necessarily a bad thing for Chen Ping’an, who was located in Beiju Luzhou.

It severed his connection with He Xiaoliang of the Qingliang Sect.

She had followed him into the Bone Marsh Ghost Valley, closely tracking him in Jingguan City. After he had endured the heavenly tribulation, she had to proactively cut off the invisible connection, likely hiding in that small cave to avoid further complications, fearing she would be dragged down by him again.

Thus, whatever gains or losses within this small realm were entirely his own matters.

In fact, this was a good thing.

The worst-case scenario was that Chen Ping’an would break through the restrictions of this realm and escape.

Even without discussing the green glazed tiles and the Daoist temple’s green bricks, those two small bamboo cages had left him utterly astonished.

They could very well be the Dragon King’s nets!

Even if they were severely damaged with the lowest rank, those two small cages were still worth repairing to new condition; they could be used for capturing dragons.

So, was Sun Daoren’s surprise worth pursuing endlessly?

It was easy to deceive others, but self-deception was also simple. For those who cultivate the Dao, as long as they still have the heart to seek the Dao and the aspiration to reach the peak, self-deception itself becomes the greatest issue.

This is precisely because what appears simplest could lead to the largest obstacles in the future.

For instance, Liu Laocheng from Shujian Lake nearly perished because of this.

Would simply giving Sun Daoren two golden talismans allow him to feel at ease and guilt-free?

Or perhaps, to save trouble and effort, simply deal with the unexpected source of trouble that was Huang Shi?

Should he weigh the outcomes based on appearance or based on intention? Or perhaps both were necessary?

Gu Can didn’t have to go through all that.

Ma Kuxuan didn’t need to either.

All the wild practitioners of the mountains might need to consider such things.

And for Cui Dongshan, Lu Tai, Zhong Kui, and Qi Jinglong, they might have their own choices, whether to align with or differ from Chen Ping’an, but they wouldn’t have to endure the same struggles he faced.

Once Chen Ping’an embarked on the path of cultivation, becoming half a practitioner, he would discover all the principles that had supported him to this day.

Those principles would indeed become burdens.

Just like when he first ascended the mountain as a child, carrying that large backpack felt heavy even before it was filled with herbs.

But the difficulty lay precisely in those burdens from earlier, which had carried him to where he was today.

Putting oneself in a difficult position was the hardest challenge in the journey of cultivation.

At that moment, Sun Daoren conveyed to Chen Ping’an through thoughts, “Chen Dao, be careful. Huang Shi is deeply concealed; he’s actually a sixth realm warrior. You don’t have many attack talismans left. I’m quite adept at close combat; just retreat a bit when the time comes. But don’t forget to support me; don’t be stingy with the talismans—just hurl everything you have at Huang Shi, but be careful not to hit me.”

Chen Ping’an was taken aback, realizing the clarity of the situation. He smiled and replied, “Rest assured, Sun Daoren. To be honest, aside from talismans, I’m also quite skilled in combat.”

Sun Daoren sighed, “Chen Dao, don’t say that. Hearing you boast only makes me more anxious.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Sun Daoren, you come from a prestigious celestial family with profound techniques; perhaps you won’t even need my help.”

Sun Daoren fell silent, thinking about how flattering this shallow-minded fellow made him feel. He had no sense of achievement.

Huang Shi’s keen instincts hinted that the two were communicating in secrecy.

He didn’t think two Daoists could come up with anything clever, especially in such dire circumstances. 

Chen Ping’an had come to understand certain things, feeling as if the world was vast, the mountains and waters were beautiful, and everything felt welcoming.

Yet, upon closer inspection, Chen Ping’an couldn’t help but frown.

He shook his head, sensing no anomalies.

Chen Ping’an couldn’t help but remind Sun Daoren, “Be careful, Sun Daoist.”

Sun Daoren laughed, “No need for such exaggeration, my friend.”

On the other side of the steps, Di Yuanfeng had indeed clashed with the two young celestial masters from Yunshang City.

The two young disciples from Yunshang City, having accidentally stumbled upon an ancient cultivation site of a celestial being, fortuitously opened a mechanism from a piece of writing and discovered the remains of a “Golden Branch and Jade Leaf, Radiant and Glorious” skeleton.

With such a sight, the brilliance that had lasted for hundreds or even thousands of years could only belong to a Gold Core earthly immortal or someone who had received an extraordinary fortune, a remnant of legendary Yu Pu realm practitioners.

As for the more extraordinary celestial remains, they should not have turned to dust and vanished.

The robe worn by the remains was almost flawless, with no sign of wear at all.

Originally, Di Yuanfeng had been secretly following the inexperienced young practitioners, not expecting much. However, upon seeing this, he realized that he had hit the jackpot. The value of the remains and the robe was evident just from their appearance, not to mention that one of the young male practitioners had already stored the remains and robe in a white misty brush tube, clearly a legendary celestial artifact.

Di Yuanfeng weighed the cultivation levels of the two and saw an opportunity. He concealed himself at the exit, waiting for a chance to strike, hoping to take the treasure and flee. A brush tube, along with the celestial skeleton and robe, would be three precious items.

Yet, unexpectedly, under a fierce strike, the young male practitioner’s robe was torn, and he sustained severe injuries, but he managed to protect the brush tube.

Di Yuanfeng was about to go for the kill against the panicked female practitioner.

Just then, an old practitioner suddenly appeared, not only repelling Di Yuanfeng but nearly leaving him trapped in that celestial’s meditative hut.

Relying on that ancestral weapon, Di Yuanfeng broke free from the magical prison and fled, cursing under his breath. The damned celestial masters were wearing two robes!

The young male practitioner turned pale and realized blood was pooling in his palm. Had he not taken precautions by wearing two robes, he would have been dead from that solid blow.

The female practitioner felt deep sympathy, her heart aching for him, and despite her own safety, she was ready to chase after Di Yuanfeng, who was seriously injured, hoping to deal a blow to his downfall.

The old Daoist who had been watching them calmly said, “Don’t pursue a desperate foe. Moreover, after such a great fortune, you should know when to quit. Now, you should consider how to leave this place. The little marquis from Beiting Country has stationed a martial arts master at both the foot and summit of the mountain to guard the way; you’ll have to discuss among yourselves.”

Then the old practitioner vanished.

The pair of young practitioners from Yunshang City, having survived, were filled with mixed emotions, not noticing the struggle in the old practitioner’s gaze.

If it weren’t for the extra protector, the ancient practitioner Huan Yun, who had been the chief protector of Yunshang City for nearly a century, they might have understood what it meant to face sudden misfortune.

And not far away, another old practitioner, adept in using talismans to conceal his presence and aura, silently observed the situation with a complex expression. He felt a mix of relief and an almost imperceptible disappointment.

Huan Yun murmured, “Cultivation is hard, but cultivating the heart is even harder.”

After a sigh of resignation, Huan Yun once again disappeared.

The previously untouched treasures that had caught his eye were now within reach.

For this pair of disciples from Shen Zhenze, they were no longer focused on treasure hunting but were concerned with figuring out how to escape.

As for the old protector at Longmen realm, he likely had similar thoughts.

Aside from the celestial artifacts in the various halls, Huan Yun was more interested in checking out the glazed tiles he had seen from afar atop the mountain; they seemed more precious than anything.

However, he wasn’t in a hurry for this; with the Gold Body realm warrior from Beiting Country stationed at the summit, Huan Yun wouldn’t dare to force a breach unless it was absolutely necessary.

Behind a rock, Di Yuanfeng, burdened with a pack, swallowed a pill and gasped for breath, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth as he cursed angrily.

As long as he still had the energy to curse, it meant he hadn’t suffered critical injuries.

Di Yuanfeng had no regrets about his attempt to seize the treasure. 

Having failed once, he didn’t want to continue entangling himself.

At the halfway point on the steps, little Marquis Zhan Qing held a folding fan, lightly fanning to create a breeze, standing beside Bai Bi, a female Gold Core earthly immortal. 

High Ling, a military general from Fuhua Country, stood at the other end of the white jade arch bridge at the foot of the mountain.

The family protector warrior from the marquis’s house had gone to the summit.

The remaining royal protector from Fuhua Country, after receiving Bai Bi’s nod, went to search for treasures.

Zhan Qing gazed into the distance, frowning. “So many people—how did they get in? Did someone break the cave’s restrictions directly?”

Bai Bi sighed, “This place itself is the biggest problem. I’ll go around the mountain to see if I can use my flying sword to contact the sect.”

Zhan Qing stood and said, “I’ll accompany you.”

Bai Bi shook her head. “You should stay at the foot of the mountain; Gao Ling knows best how to safeguard your safety. There’s no need to rush to the summit; it’s too risky, and I wouldn’t feel at ease exploring the boundaries here.”

Bai Bi soared into the air, transforming into a rainbow as she departed.

Zhan Qing’s heart yearned for her.

This was the demeanor of a Gold Core earthly immortal.

Zhan Qing slowly descended the mountain. A Gold Body realm Gao Ling might not be able to handle all treasure hunters.

However, as long as the influx of visitors to the summit didn’t manage to form a cohesive force, they would be scattered and easy for Zhan Qing to handle.

After entering the secret realm, she had discussed with Bai Bi and changed her mind.

Thus, Zhan Qing didn’t plan to massacre everyone; instead, she aimed to strike a deal with those passing practitioners and warriors.

They could ascend the mountain, but upon descending, they would need to privately meet with Zhan Qing and hand over one of the items she had her eye on.

Just one would suffice.

As for the other items carried by the lucky ones, Bai Bi would naturally keep a record and later report to the Water Dragon Sect’s Hall of Ancestors, allowing those earthly immortals to capture these ants and reclaim their treasures.

This way, Zhan Qing wouldn’t need to kill anyone herself, and they could profit through peace.

It would save much trouble and unexpected complications.

Wild practitioners, unless they felt they were in a dire situation, generally feared death and valued their lives, making them easy to negotiate with.

In contrast, those celestial masters, caught in the middle, often failed to grasp the situation.

Her master, an earthly immortal from a wild practitioner background, was now a nominal protector of the Water Dragon Sect, and Bai Bi was her future divine partner, making them practically family.

Thus, this celestial mansion relic was a treasure trove for the Water Dragon Sect.

Before this, Bai Bi had discussed with her to gather as many precious items as possible, ensuring they didn’t exceed five; greed would only lead to ruin. If they were to take too many treasures, it would be hard to explain to the sect, and Zhan Qing’s actions must remain discreet. During this period, they must avoid touching treasures that would make earthly immortals dream of riches. Otherwise, the elders of the sect would be vigilant, and if they heard of any disturbances, they would investigate every intruder, leaving no stone unturned. Should Zhan Qing reveal herself, Bai Bi would also be implicated, risking being branded a traitor to the sect, which would be a disaster.

However, if they successfully retrieved three or four valuable artifacts, even if the Hall of Ancestors learned of it, the respect for Bai Bi’s mentor and Zhan Qing’s master would grant them leniency.

Every celestial master on the mountain, bound by rules and heritage, was also restricted by their duties and doctrines.

As Zhan Qing approached the foot of the mountain, she instructed Gao Ling, the newly promoted Gold Body realm general from Fuhua Country, to ensure compliance.

Gao Ling had no objections.

On the day that Zhan Qing escorted the female practitioner Bai Bi back home to the capital, an imperial decree arrived at Gao Ling's general office.

Thus, Gao Ling understood one thing: in the Fuhua Country, where military merit was as hard to earn as climbing to the heavens, establishing a connection with the Water Dragon Sect was worth more than anything.

Zhan Qing stood at one end of the white jade arch bridge, lightly knocking on the bridge’s strange beast with her folding fan, appearing like a jade tree in the wind, graceful and elegant.

Gao Ling loudly reminded the nearby crowd of the rules they needed to abide by.

Of course, no one was inclined to obey.

Some, not daring to charge ahead, attempted to leap over from other locations across the emerald river, resembling a moat.

Yet Gao Ling dashed forward, intercepting one with a punch, killing him instantly and scattering the body into seven or eight pieces.

Gao Ling held back little with that punch.

Thus, the nearby practitioners gasped, recognizing Gao Ling’s identity as a Gold Body realm warrior, the first among the martial artists of Fuhua Country.

After that punch, the previously noisy crowd across the bridge fell silent, only whispers remaining.

Unbeknownst to them, someone had used a celestial secret technique. A raspy voice echoed, “We have the numbers; let’s team up to take these two down. Then we can each take our share and head up the mountain. Why should we wait for their approval? If luck is on our side, we might only get one treasure, but do we really want to hand it over to those spoiled nobles from Beiting Country? If we don’t unite now, it’ll be even harder to act as one when we descend the mountain.”

These words stirred many hearts.

The two female practitioners from Cai Que Mansion exchanged glances and smiled.

The one who had uttered these tempting words was a direct descendant of the Hall of Ancestors, a young girl. 

Though young, she was sharp-minded.

They were Cai Que Mansion’s leader, Sun Qing, and the lawmaster of the Hall of Ancestors, Wu Qian.

Originally, Wu Qian had been sufficient to protect them, but Sun Qing had come along for a change of pace and unexpectedly stumbled upon great fortune.

Wu Qian secretly communicated with the young mansion leader, “That young earthly immortal we encountered earlier must be Bai Bi from Fuhua Country, right?”

Sun Qing scoffed, “What if she’s a direct disciple of the Water Dragon Sect? In a chaotic battle, if she lacks the depth and skill, it doesn’t matter if she dies.”

Having said this, Sun Qing’s expression turned calm. “What’s done is done.”

Wu Qian felt anxious, glancing at the composed young mansion leader. No wonder she was the youngest Gold Core mansion leader in history while he was merely the lawmaster for a year.

On their side of the riverbank, the clamor grew, with people shouting to kill the Fuhua Country general and skin the little marquis from Beiting Country.

Yet Zhan Qing smiled brightly, snapping her fan open, fanning a gentle breeze. She simply said, “If you want to kill me, go ahead; it’s first come, first served.”

Sun Qing chuckled and lightly nudged Wu Qian with her elbow. “You should take the lead; otherwise, we’ll just waste time.”

Wu Qian understood her intentions.

Wearing a veil and using a concealment technique, Wu Qian boldly stepped out of the crowd, crossing onto the white jade arch bridge, initially walking slowly.

Those on the bridge hesitated, fearing this unknown woman might lead them into danger, making them the first to get struck down by Gao Ling’s fists.

But soon, as Wu Qian walked faster, she suddenly unleashed celestial offensive techniques, taking two of Gao Ling’s punches head-on. One punch broke her spell, while the other sent her flying backward across the bridge.

The female practitioner, however, was tough; after struggling to rise, she remained silent and headed back toward the bridge.

With someone leading the charge, the crowd felt relieved, erupting into cheers and rushing across the bridge.

Zhan Qing was furious, hating the reckless woman who had blazed the trail.

Without any hesitation, she turned and, with a flick of her fingers, blew a loud whistle that echoed throughout.

The family protector, a seventh realm warrior, dashed down the mountain, leaping high from the white jade square and landing heavily on the ascending steps.

Those at the foot of the mountain noticed this scene and felt their hearts race, weakening their resolve.

Yet another raspy female voice rang out, “Let’s take down those two at the bridge first; what can one more do? One strike each, and they’ll be nothing but mush!”

At the foot of the mountain, chaos erupted.

In the distance, Bai Bi hovered in the air, her figure suspended at the edge of a boundary, surrounded by a thick mist. No matter how she employed her techniques, she couldn’t see the landscape beyond that line.

Gradually, she descended, using a pebble to break through the mist, but it vanished without a trace.

Then, she tore apart a large section of the ground and entered the cloud of mist, still finding no response.

This was far more frightening than the mountain’s water restrictions.

What lay ahead was the unknown.

In the history of the Water Dragon Sect, a Jade Pu realm elder and a Gold Core great practitioner had both perished within this secret realm, and the sect had never recovered their remains.

Bai Bi felt anxious, realizing she needed to consider a way out.

What had once seemed like a shallow pond now appeared to be a significant treasure trove.

The river running through the middle of North Ju Luzhou was the foundation of the Water Dragon Sect, and its most vital Hall of Ancestors had originally been one of three ancient shrines along the river. The other two had either been seized by the Dayuan Dynasty, which honored it as the true shrine, or had been claimed by a now-defunct sect and subsequently destroyed in battles with sword cultivators.

The atmosphere here bore some resemblance to her own Hall of Ancestors, which gave Bai Bi the confidence to allow Zhan Qing to take four treasures.

If this truly were a relic of an ancient river shrine, the two of them would be credited with the merits of their discovery.

However, Bai Bi felt a lingering worry, fearing the worst outcome.

It wasn’t merely about being unable to escape or finding no way out.

If she and Zhan Qing were to disappear for too long, the Water Dragon Sect would surely follow the trail to find them.

Bai Bi was genuinely worried that this place could turn into a new grave for everyone.

What if those seemingly orderly bones were actually the remains of new victims rather than those of ancient celestial beings?

That would indicate that this place was essentially a massive trap, waiting for outsiders to walk in, believing they had stumbled upon a great fortune and could share in the spoils.

Of course, that was just a possibility.

But in Bai Bi’s heart, this possibility had transformed from a mere chance to a certainty, growing more probable with the passage of time.

In a moment of panic, Bai Bi decided not to linger at the boundary of this small world any longer. She swiftly rode the wind back to find Zhan Qing, seeking to devise a foolproof plan.

After Bai Bi vanished, a tall, ethereal elder emerged from the mist, smiling. “Three Gold Core practitioners, two Gold Body realm warriors… and a peculiar little one. This should make for a delightful feast.”

A strand of sword energy fell from the sky, piercing through the elder’s crown, yet his ethereal figure reappeared elsewhere, smiling, “Goodness, we’ve been neighbors for many years; you’re still behaving so poorly. With all these restrictive barriers, I can’t refine this mountain’s waters, but layers upon layers of mountains encircle this small world. You’ve only been able to protect this place from losing its essence; what else can you do?”

The elder’s head was pierced again by that persistent strand of sword energy but reassembled in another place, his expression unperturbed. “According to our old customs, I’ll leave just one last person behind, allowing him to die a moment later to chat with me about the world outside. He’ll come to understand how intricate this trap truly is. All those treasures—where can you take them? A meal on the table, a place to die, this small world is where the children’s luck seems fortunate. But it’s a pity for a Daoist temple; that little sword-bearing child has a keen eye, but you can’t take those things with you. After all, I’ll have to piece together my belongings again. How many times has it been? Each time, I have to move again; it’s truly exhausting.”

Once again, the elder’s figure was torn apart by the relentless sword energy, but he continued to retreat into the mist, his towering form slowly disappearing. He lightly patted his belly, chuckling, “Haha, what a vast world; what a unique little pocket I have. In any world, people kill one another the most. How utterly meaningless.”

Once the elder’s figure had vanished, that strand of sword energy lingered nearby for a long time, sweeping through the ground before finally shooting into the sky and returning to the heights.

Chen Ping’an suddenly turned his head, gazing into the distance, perhaps the only one who noticed that strand of sword energy descending and then ascending.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 642: A Thousand Young Men in One’s Eyes

The back mountain was filled with strange flowers and unusual grasses, yet there were no birds, insects, or ants to be found. 

Chen Ping'an noticed something peculiar: when he and his companions first entered this celestial household, they had seen a crane circling the mountain. However, after the four of them ascended, the crane had vanished without a trace. Whether Chen Ping'an looked up from the foot of the mountain or gazed down from the summit's Taoist temple, or later followed Huang Shi and Sun Daoren on their treasure hunt, right up to this point on the back mountain, he had not caught even a glimpse of that crane again.

If indeed there was a recluse residing here, and assuming the worst—if the host harbored sinister intentions towards all visitors—then this person would undoubtedly be a master at manipulating human hearts.

For ordinary folk, such as mountain dwellers or woodcutters, merely catching sight of the crane upon entering the mountain might suffice. Most would be stunned by the subsequent majestic white jade bridges and archways, perceiving this place as a realm of immortals. Coupled with the sight of scattered white bones, they would naturally consider this a land without a master.

Yet for practitioners of the Dao, the fleeting images seen unconsciously—especially the first sight—could greatly influence one's disposition, silently and imperceptibly. 

In the future, every thought and action of a Qi practitioner, no matter their level, would inevitably be scrutinized repeatedly. 

When Chen Ping'an first saw the verdant mountains, crystal-clear waters, and the snow-white crane, he felt a profound sense of admiration. His first thought was simply: what a splendid celestial abode, what a beautiful landscape. 

From then on, everything he encountered was merely an extension of the celestial household, along with some ruins. 

The celestial aspects remained celestial, and the blessings were still blessings. 

Everywhere there were clues, intricate and complex, as if hidden mechanisms lay in wait. Over time, the abundance of them could leave one feeling lost in a tangled mess, resulting in a reluctance to ponder further.

Chen Ping'an also had little clarity, yet the sudden drop of that sword energy felt like a flash of insight. If the crane had been some clever trick, and considering that the bell at Sun Daoren's waist had inexplicably exploded during their journey, a thread could be pulled from this, or rather, a potential worst-case scenario could be imagined.

This nuanced perception of the best and worst possibilities based on a fleeting moment was key to Chen Ping'an's survival when he had walked out of the Bone Marsh Ghost Valley beneath the watchful eyes of Gao Cheng.

The world is complex; seeing or not seeing, thinking or not thinking—these are all matters of learning and cultivation of one's heart.

Of course, there were also those who stumbled upon opportunities by sheer luck, merely muddling through life until they either perished or stumbled upon fortune.

The three continued to explore the back mountain, which appeared to be a much more leisurely affair compared to the desperate struggles of the front mountain.

As for the life or death of Di Yuanfeng, Chen Ping'an bore no burden. He wasn’t related to him by blood or any ancestral ties; had he been a man of good intentions, Chen Ping'an might have intervened to broker some kind of equitable trade.

At this moment, by the roadside stood a solitary green bamboo, catching the attention of the trio. It appeared lonely and forlorn, its shadows dancing in the breeze.

The bamboo was as thick as a bowl's mouth, and its leaves were a vivid green, not just in poetic terms, but truly vibrant and dripping with moisture. Many leaf tips had gathered droplets of water, which trembled precariously in the wind. As the three gazed at the bamboo, a droplet of emerald water fell to the muddy ground, dissipating instantly. Chen Ping'an focused intently, sensing something significant; though it wasn’t the essence of water produced by the emerald tiles or the blue bricks of a Taoist temple, it was still at an exaggerated level of spiritual energy coalescing into water.

As Sun Daoren passed by, he gently tapped the bamboo and leaned in to listen, letting out a soft “Hmm,” and remarked, “There’s something to this.”

While the two stared at the bamboo, Chen Ping'an turned to his satchel and took out his sword nurturing gourd, holding it in his hand before adjusting his pack. He then smiled and said, “Could you shake the bamboo for me, Daoist Sun? I’d like to collect some water from the tips of the leaves.”

Sun Daoren, being a genuine practitioner at the Ocean Observing Realm, could gauge the depth of the situation and shook his head with a smile, “Chen Daoist, I advise you not to bother. The droplets of bamboo leaf water nurtured by spiritual energy cannot be contained by ordinary vessels. Not to mention trying to collect them in a wine jug, even if you manage to gather a handful of leaves with water drops, once you’re away from this strange bamboo, they too will evaporate.”

Though the tall, thin Daoist mentioned this, it didn’t stop him from unwrapping his robe to take out a small blue porcelain bottle painted with a depiction of a pine hermit.

Huang Shi, annoyed by the two's dalliance, kicked the bamboo stalk. Instantly, droplets fell like a light rain. Sun Daoren burst into laughter, shifting his stance, and stepped forward with a blue porcelain bottle to collect the water.

Chen Ping'an, too, was reluctant to let a single droplet hit the ground and, without competing with Sun Daoren, used a water technique to gather many droplets that were about to fall into the mud, slowly collecting them into his sword nurturing gourd.

Huang Shi glanced at the black-robed elder’s technique, finding no flaws to question, and thus let it go.

Since Chen Ping'an had taken out his sword nurturing gourd, he did not put it away, instead hanging it at his waist. The water droplets, coalescing from the heavens' spiritual energy, gathered to form a weighty substance, amounting to the weight of ten or more pounds.

The three continued on their way.

Chen Ping'an glanced back at the green bamboo.

Could it be that, like the bamboo grove carefully cultivated by Wei Ban on Chess Stone Mountain, they all traced their roots back to the Qing Shen Mountain of the Bamboo Sea Cave? 

Otherwise, according to the celestial records he had previously acquired from the Upside-Down Mountain, many of the celestial bamboos in the vast world seemed to be less capable of gathering water than this bamboo.

It's a pity it couldn’t be transported like the chess table stone.

Sun Daoren, feeling a bit unsatisfied, reached out and said with a smile, “Bamboo is connected to the divine, lightens the body and replenishes energy. In my early years of cultivation, I came across an ancient text that noted bamboo leaves brewed into tea are most refreshing and invigorating. During the hot summer days, just a handful of bamboo leaves combined with a few lotus seeds from the mountain, and after drinking one or two cups, it would make one feel as if they were floating as if they were an immortal.”

Chen Ping'an glanced at Sun Daoren, then at the tall green bamboo that remained utterly unyielding.

Since it had come to this, he felt somewhat at a loss for flattery.

Sun Daoren, retracting his hand, calmly said, “Never mind, let this opportunity be reserved for future generations.”

Huang Shi, eager to take action, said, “These bamboo leaves, if collected by practitioners of the lower realms, could be refined into their life’s essence. They could indeed be treasures! The treasures are right before us; be cautious not to incur heaven’s wrath by refusing what is offered. Daoist Sun, would you truly not take a few handfuls? Even if not for brewing tea, gifting them to the descendants of the Thunder God’s abode would still be an exceptional token for our return to the sect.”

Sun Daoren, unperturbed, replied, “Cultivating the Dao involves fundamental matters; one cannot carelessly grant opportunities. I am not their teacher; gifts that are too extravagant may be unseemly. Enough of this.”

Chen Ping'an quietly praised, “Daoist Sun, your words are profound and thought-provoking.”

Sun Daoren carefully tucked the blue porcelain bottle into his sleeve, moving forward with a thoughtful smile—a man of great depth.

Huang Shi could hardly endure the unsophisticated demeanor of this wandering Daoist from the Wuling Kingdom. Ever since learning that Sun Daoren was a disciple of the Thunder God’s abode, he had been overly attentive towards him.

Suddenly, Huang Shi, using the method of the Golden Body Realm, applied the strength of the fifth realm in a punch, slightly holding back as he gauged the physique of the black-robed elder. Without warning, he threw a punch at the elder, resulting in a loud bang. The elder was knocked back, rolling and struggling to rise, seemingly dazed. Sitting on the ground, he suddenly coughed up a mouthful of dark blood, as if he had just regained his senses, standing with his hands hidden in his sleeves, clearly preparing a talisman at his fingertips, he yelled angrily, “Huang, are you looking to die?!”

Huang Shi felt relieved; indeed, he was a useless fellow.

Sun Daoren, startled, quickly leaped several feet away, also preparing a defensive talisman he had just purchased from Chen Ping'an.

The three formed a triangle.

Huang Shi didn’t even glance at the black-robed elder, merely turning to Sun Daoren with a smile, “Daoist Sun, one must be wary of treachery; we are allies with Young Master Qin, at least familiar with each other. But this person, we met by chance; if he is a crafty rogue, we would be the ones caught off guard. In the end, we might lose all our treasures and opportunities, sacrificing our lives to benefit others. I believe Daoist Sun would not wish for such an outcome?”

Sun Daoren conveyed through his heart, “Chen Daoist, what do you say? Should we have a contest? This Huang Shi is not to be trifled with. If we truly tear our masks apart, we brothers would be like grasshoppers on the same string; neither of us could hide our true intentions.”

In comparison, Sun Daoren naturally trusted the black-robed elder more. After their journey, he felt the connection with good and evil was tenuous; he regarded Chen Daoist as a lesser threat due to his apparent lack of ability. Nevertheless, if the black-robed elder’s actions were shrewd and cunning, and he were to shift sides, Sun Daoren would not be inclined to risk his life in confrontation with Huang Shi.

As he communicated this in his heart to Chen Ping'an, Sun Daoren verbally expressed, “Chen Daoist, Huang’s actions are somewhat excessive. However, the situation is unpredictable. If we engage in infighting, it would be the true act of dressing another’s wedding gown. How about you both give me some face, and Chen Daoist, please calm down. I will have Huang apologize; let’s consider this matter settled, shall we?”

Chen Ping'an, infuriated, responded, “No! After receiving such a punch and suffering this unwarranted disaster, a mere apology won’t suffice! How about Huang Shi face my thunder talisman instead? Consider it even!”

Huang Shi twitched his lips, opening a corner of his package to extract an object, lightly tossing it toward the black-robed elder, and said with a smile, “If an apology is not enough, let’s add a gift of thanks.”

The black-robed elder’s eyes lit up at the sight of the object, hesitating briefly, but still stealthily prepared his talisman while raising a hand to catch the antiquated copper mirror thrown toward him.

Sun Daoren’s expression changed drastically, and he quickly warned, “Don’t catch it!”

But it was too late.

Huang Shi stepped forward, using his peak strength from the sixth realm, arriving in front of the black-robed elder in an instant, and threw a punch.

The black-robed elder was stunned, standing there in shock, frozen in place, unable to catch the copper mirror, instead taking the punch head-on.

Huang Shi suddenly halted his punch, letting the force merely brush past the unfortunate elder’s face, causing his hair to blow back.

Huang Shi retracted his fist, adjusting his heavy bag, and turned to leave, glancing back after taking a few steps to say, “Chen, old brother, this copper mirror is yours now.”

Sun Daoren sighed inwardly. 

How had he ended up with such a dim-witted ally? 

What a hardship.

The road ahead would not be easy. 

There was no choice but to take on more responsibility himself.

Sun Daoren watched as Chen Daoist offered him an apologetic smile, squatting down to pick up the fallen copper mirror, placing it in a somewhat deflated blue cloth bag. 

Even though he tried his best to hide his fear and anxiety, his hands were still trembling slightly.

Seeing this, Sun Daoren shook his head in frustration, turning to follow Huang Shi, feeling somewhat sympathetic yet irritated at this fellow. He said in his heart, “Chen Daoist! Remember your place moving forward; don’t get too close to Huang Shi. It’s best to keep yourself a distance away from him. If Huang Shi gets too close, no amount of talismans will help you; don’t you understand this simple principle that a Qi practitioner should never allow a pure martial artist to get close?!”

“Daoist Sun, I understand the principle, but when it comes to actually fighting Huang Shi, my mind goes blank and my limbs don’t respond; I really can’t keep up with the theory in practice,” replied Chen Ping'an.

After securing the copper mirror, the man quickened his pace to catch up with Sun Daoren, then slowed down to walk behind him, keeping in step. 

Sun Daoren sighed and said no more; at least he was a person who would learn from mistakes, not entirely hopeless.

Chen Ping'an brought up the rear, gently wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth. 

Ordinary martial artists traversing the world often ended up with bloodied faces due to bad luck.

But for Chen Ping'an, it was different; he had to do it himself.

However, thinking about that ancient copper mirror, his resentment faded.

The inscription was tiny, with the front reading “Repel Soldiers, None Shall Stand” and the back stating “Ward Off Evil, Eliminate Misfortune.”

This was undoubtedly an anti-evil mirror, and it was an imitation, as upon careful inspection, Chen Ping'an discovered the minuscule inscription “crafted by the Gong family.” This detail was what made it truly valuable. 

For anyone to quietly inscribe the surname “Gong” on a copper mirror artifact was a testament to its quality.

The celestial records spoke of this matter, particularly regarding the ancient mirrors with sea beast grape patterns like “Li Pu Zao” and “Nalan Sanshan Zao,” which were immensely valuable. Imitations that came after were often traps for half-baked Qi practitioners; even if they were exquisite and flawless, they remained a big pitfall. Those who believed they had found a treasure would regret it if they attempted to refine them into their life’s essence.

Earlier, Chen Ping'an had almost given in to the temptation to let Sun Daoren have a look, under the pretense of helping him appraise it, before taking it seriously himself. 

This Daoist Sun’s hands had to have been blessed, right?

Aside from this acquisition, the string of pagoda bells hanging from the waist of the tall, thin Daoist was clearly not an ordinary object.

Otherwise, it wouldn’t have shattered spontaneously as a warning outside the mountain-top temple.

On the back mountain, the structures were far fewer than the densely packed front mountain, and only three grand buildings could be counted.

As the three descended the mountain, the view was sparse.

This also prevented a lot of trouble.

As per the usual arrangement, Huang Shi would search for treasure at a place nearby, while Sun Daoren headed off to another location with a tall building. Chen Ping'an was assigned to the closest hall at the foot of the mountain.

After parting from Sun Daoren, Chen Ping'an walked leisurely as if wandering through a garden, taking out his sword nurturing gourd to sip the bamboo leaf spirit water. It genuinely felt refreshing.

Though the flavor was a bit bland, lacking the richness of wine.

Just the thought of this spiritually rich bamboo leaf essence being precious and rare, far surpassing celestial brews, instantly made him feel the taste was exquisite, a lingering aftertaste.

With just this sip, he was drinking not mere tea but a fortune of celestial money—how could it not be delightful?

Turning back, he saw no trace of Huang Shi or Sun Daoren. Chen Ping'an then secured his sword nurturing gourd, bent low, and suddenly dashed forward, effortlessly leaping over a high wall and landing gracefully.

It was as though he had melded with the heavens and earth, making no sound and creating no ripples.

At the foot of the front mountain, near the white jade bridge, a chaotic battle raged.

In the words of the customs of North Julu Prefecture, they were fighting fiercely enough to drink the brain matter as wine; now that was true heroism.

This fierce battle for the bridge had become exceptionally brutal.

Even the royal offering from the Fuhua Kingdom searching for treasures on the mountain had heard the commotion, having to abandon readily obtainable opportunities and rush to the battlefield.

However, this Fuhua Kingdom offering had a clever plan, selecting a portion of the treasures he deemed valuable to hide in a loft's beam while casually wrapping the rest together and moving them to another corner of the house. When it came time to return with Bai Bi and the young marquis, he wouldn't raise any suspicion. As for how to ultimately smuggle out his hidden treasures, he'd take it step by step.

Gao Ling had taken out the military armor, donning a divine armor that revealed his presence while partnering with the family offering to safeguard Zhan Qing’s safety.

Zhan Qing, a practitioner of the cave realm trained under a Nascent Soul grandmaster, feigned panic. This act, combined with his previous haughty words, proved effective; few believed this North Ting noble youth was an actual mid-stage five realm practitioner, nor did he possess two powerful offensive treasures.

The originally one-sided battle shifted slightly in favor after the Fuhua Kingdom offering joined the fray.

Zhan Qing held a grudge against the woman in the cloud-castle robe with the cloud-like aura, as she was the one who first crossed the bridge and disrupted his scheme to gain wealth.

What’s more, this hidden female practitioner was exceptionally strategic during the ensuing chaos, avoiding direct confrontation with the golden body martial artists while not sitting idly by, allowing various practitioners and martial artists to die; every time Gao Ling was able to strike down an opponent, the female practitioner would counteract in time, saving the lives of seven or eight people in just a short while.

The two defensive life treasures she possessed were a jade bracelet that glimmered with a blue light, spinning erratically, and a golden embroidered rug adorned with five dragons. Gao Ling's punch merely made a dent in it, causing it to vibrate without shattering. After a punch, its golden dragon sheen would dim slightly. However, the bracelet and rug alternated in defense; once saturated with spiritual energy, the golden sheen would quickly restore.

With over forty people surrounding them, everyone unleashed their offensive treasures, creating a grand spectacle. If not for the practitioners' unfamiliar cooperation, some of the four and five realm pure martial artists would not dare to get too close, mostly resorting to long-range attacks with bows and crossbows or sending out pressure waves to trouble the opposing side, making it hard to connect seamlessly; otherwise, they would find it even harder to cope. But once the mountain-dwelling wild practitioners chose to fight for their lives, even someone like Zhan Qing, who had only seen minimal blood, or Gao Ling, who came from a military background, along with the family offering accustomed to luxury, would feel their hearts race.

The family offering was ambushed by someone with a secret treasure, penetrating their abdomen and causing a severe bleed. However, relying on their golden body physique, they held on for dear life. Gao Ling, skilled in battle formations, was not unfamiliar with the encirclement of spears and halberds, which still left him relatively unscathed. As for the Fuhua royal offering, they were in a miserable state, struck by a stream of offensive artifacts. Had Gao Ling not assisted with a punch to disperse most of the attack, the offering would have certainly perished on the spot.

Still, these two golden body martial artists were no pushovers; even with the assistance of the Cai Que Mansion, they still killed seven or eight people, leaving behind a gruesome scene reminiscent of a public execution.

Thus, the swift arrival of the Water Dragon Sect’s Golden Core immortal Bai Bi was not just a bonus, but a timely resource.

Yet as soon as Bai Bi summoned both an offensive and a defensive treasure, the young mansion lord of Cai Que Mansion, Sun Qing, took to the skies, choosing to engage this young sect disciple in battle.

Surrounding Bai Bi was a set of eighteen victory talismans gifted by the Water Dragon Sect, which was well-suited for Bai Bi, a naturally talented practitioner of water techniques. The talisman inscriptions held significant meaning, containing remnants of national fortune, once used to mint coins in an ancient dynasty, then scattered in various places, placed in old Taoist temple beams, or buried in ancient tombs, or even collected by the royal treasury over the years, making up two sets of eighteen, one of which was gifted to Bai Bi.

This set of victory talismans, regarded as valuable items within the Water Dragon Sect, was both offensive and defensive.

However, Bai Bi still summoned a heavy artifact from the mountain, an ancient zither from the hands of a renowned zither master in North Julu Prefecture, named “Falling Snow.”

Once the two Golden Core practitioners made their move, the battle intensified.

Then someone with a raspy voice shouted, “Let’s take down the young marquis first!”

Zhan Qing was furious; this person was truly difficult to deal with.

Every time he opened his mouth, it had the effect of using four ounces to counter a thousand pounds.

But the opponent clearly wielded some secret technique from the mountain; combined with the perilous chaos, it became a mess, making it difficult for Zhan Qing's group to identify their adversary.

Neither Gao Ling nor the family offering would dare to watch as they were killed by techniques and artifacts. However, if they took care of Zhan Qing too much, it would inevitably lead to neglect elsewhere. Once a flaw appeared, it would cause a chain reaction, easily endangering Bai Bi. Zhan Qing could assert that as long as they lost a Golden Body realm martial artist or someone was severely injured and had to withdraw from the battlefield, these desperate wild practitioners would fight even harder.

Zhan Qing had already warned Gao Ling and the two family offerings, suggesting they focus their efforts on taking down one or two of the enemy’s groups, cleaning them out entirely to deter vengeance from their friends, only to find that fate had conspired against them. The battles had become increasingly reckless, and due to a series of unfortunate events, Gao Ling and the two offerings could no longer act cautiously. They had to focus on killing, while the opponent had the advantage in numbers, attacking indiscriminately with a flurry of treasures and insidious techniques.

At this moment, Zhan Qing began to regret his earlier arrogance.

He should never have viewed seizing all the local opportunities as a simple task.

Instead, they should have taken a step-by-step, methodical approach rather than believing their group could easily slay a Nascent Soul practitioner, dismissing the wild practitioners as mere ants.

The situation had turned dire, and now he found himself regretting his earlier belief that he could block the path of anyone, like the narrative of a hero standing against a thousand.

Zhan Qing had initially calculated well, but on the path of cultivation, one misstep could lead to a complete failure.

Bai Bi suddenly realized that as a distinguished Golden Core disciple of the Water Dragon Sect, he could not compete with the young female practitioner before him who concealed her face. 

Bai Bi angrily stated, “Sun Qing from Cai Que Mansion! Do you dare to kill me? Are you not afraid of incurring the wrath of the Water Dragon Sect? A single slap from my family’s elder could flatten your Peach Blossom Crossing Cai Que Mansion!”

The reason Bai Bi refrained from shouting directly was that, being a disciple of the lineage, he was far more cautious in dealing with the wild practitioners, weighing his options carefully.

Sun Qing, wielding her offensive artifact, shattered the “Falling Snow” zither strings, scattering the “snowflakes” that were unleashed, and replied with a smile, “What are you saying? I can’t understand you.”

Bai Bi, infuriated, exclaimed, “Sun Qing! Are you truly seeking a fight to the death with me?!”

With eighteen victory talismans surrounding him, Bai Bi was still holding his ground against Sun Qing. Moreover, this talisman arrangement was both offensive and defensive, and he had yet to exert his full power. Furthermore, as a lineage disciple, he certainly had one or two ultimate escape techniques up his sleeve. Thus, Bai Bi’s anger stemmed more from the loss of an opportunity for solitary gain than from any immediate peril, and compared to Zhan Qing, who was already in the thick of battle, Bai Bi was in a much better position.

Sun Qing remained unyielding, smiling, “As free-spirited wild practitioners, we care nothing for ties; we live or die at our own whim.”

For a female practitioner to utter such words was truly overstepping.

Bai Bi took a deep breath, calming his mind to a tranquil state, devoid of any distractions, to the point where he could entirely ignore Zhan Qing’s situation.

Since the rules of the disciples of the lineage were unyielding, and both parties were of equal standing, the only way to resolve this was through a battle of cultivation.

Although Sun Qing appeared nonchalant, she was far more composed than Bai Bi, who had only recently entered the Golden Core stage. However, she remained vigilant, knowing she was facing a talented young genius of a well-established sect, and awaited the opportunity for a decisive strike. If that failed, then it would be time to sit down and negotiate as disciples.

Should the opponent be superior in skill, it would be no great loss to her.

She could kill, and others could kill her.

Thus, when that sword cultivator, who resembled a teacher, had traveled with her, he once said, “No one in this world is exempt from death.”

However, that same land dragon from North Julu had also added, “But everyone in this world can reason.”

Sun Qing had never fully accepted that latter statement, finding little truth in it.

But she liked him, so she wouldn’t argue.

Of course, should she truly engage Liu Jinglong in a debate, it would merely be self-inflicted suffering.

She would never win against him.

Back then, Liu Jinglong, as a Golden Core sword cultivator, had managed to persuade an old monster of the Jade Purity stage, who was intent on slaughtering, with merely his words. Not only that, he had even formed a somewhat adversarial yet friendly relationship with the old monster, who had subsequently guided their group safely out of the region.

Last time Sun Qing had “coincidentally encountered” Liu Jinglong, after some polite exchanges, they had run out of things to discuss. She casually inquired about that encounter, and Liu Jinglong had said he had met the old senior while traveling south, and they had enjoyed a pleasant conversation. However, the senior had insisted that Liu Jinglong return north to the Tai Hui Sword Sect to cultivate without making another trip back up the mountain.

As Chen Ping'an searched the area, he found few bones scattered on the ground. He silently apologized to them, then squatted down to examine a bone, which was still like any mundane skeletal remains, unlike the ones at the Bone Marsh that were tainted with dark energy and appeared a ghostly white. 

It was the same on the front mountain.

This indicated that the local practitioners had never truly produced a capable immortal in their lifetimes, at least not one who had reached the Earth Immortal stage. 

There was also something odd. In the pavilion with the stone table engraved with a chessboard, the two players were clearly adorned in well-crafted robes. However, after Huang Shi stripped them of their clothing, Chen Ping'an discovered that those two corpses still lacked the quality of Golden Core lineage.

Wherever Chen Ping'an went, the winding paths were still filled with rich spiritual energy, and he felt no discomfort.

Thus, he wasted another Yang Energy Lamp Talisman.

Chen Ping'an’s gains were meager, with only a few severely cracked mountain artifacts, confirming that he should have explored with Sun Daoren instead.

He arrived at a dried-up pond, with decaying leaves scattered about.

It seemed that if it were full of water, it would have been a place of springs.

Chen Ping'an pondered over the inscriptions at the entrance of the cave. The one who left them must have been someone who had entered this celestial ruin.

It could be either a hidden immortal leaving behind clues for future generations or merely someone fearing even the fish were too dull to bite the bait.

Chen Ping'an climbed over the railing and leaped into the pond, finding the dry leaves crumbling at his touch, showing no hidden secrets.

The spiritual energy related to water from the back mountain was indeed most concentrated near that green bamboo.

What the Fallen Mountain truly lacked was a good bamboo.

If it could be like the courageous bamboo ancestor that Wei Ban cherished so much on Chess Stone Mountain, year after year branching out, with roots spreading underground, producing children and grandchildren, it could easily give rise to a lush grove of bamboos.

Of course, in Chen Ping'an's eyes, Fallen Mountain lacked everything.

He gathered a handful of soil, which quickly crumbled into dust at his fingertips, scattering in all directions.

As for the great river in North Julu, Chen Ping'an knew a fair bit.

Yet he remained largely ignorant of the deeper undercurrents, the rise and fall of shrines, and the shifts in history. 

He had only ever heard Wei Ban mention that there had once been an east-west river in Liuxia Prefecture, winding thirty thousand miles, which would overflow with sages and earth immortals whenever mountains and waters met.

There was also a river in Fuyou Prefecture, where a massive floodwater had breached a dam, causing the great river to surge into the sea, which led to calamity affecting the entire waterway. In just three hundred years, the river completely vanished, meaning all the water deities and river gods along its banks would dissolve into their golden forms. The rituals and protocols for deifying deities along the river were exceedingly complex, far more so than those required by a monarch for local mountain and river deities, often requiring documents submitted to the Confucian academies of the Central Plains.

Chen Ping'an surveyed his surroundings, finding no signs of life, and took a deep swig from his sword nurturing gourd, draining it in one go, immersing his mind and spirit, his thoughts as small as a mustard seed, exploring the waters.

He noticed the gates of the water realm wide open, as if they hadn’t been closed at all.

At his feet flowed a stream of emerald water, gradually coalescing from various water lines, slowly winding its way into the pond of the water realm.

The little green-clad children scurrying about didn't even glance at the great benefactor who had arrived; they were all bustling about, filled with excitement.

This scene made Chen Ping'an feel a pang of sadness, realizing that the little ones were truly impoverished.

He also took a look at the mountain shrine, where a finer stream flowed, trickling toward the sacred site of the mountain shrine. This water, having had all its essence intercepted in the water realm, flowed clear and colorless, devoid of the rich emerald hues that had previously characterized it. The dense spiritual energy transformed into a gentle rain, saturating the earth once it reached the shrine’s location.

Chen Ping'an contemplated this for a moment, then withdrew his spirit, no longer lingering in this treasure-less residence. With the cultivation and steps befitting a Daoist friend, he took off running, stealthily returning to that green bamboo that was likely from the Qing Shen Mountain, placing his palm on the bamboo stalk and giving it a gentle shake, causing the bamboo to sway slightly. 

Then, with his sword nurturing gourd in hand, he waved his sleeve to gather the remaining droplets of water from the bamboo leaves, all of which he successfully collected into the gourd.

Chen Ping'an felt quite pleased with himself.

It seemed he truly was a master at picking up bargains.

After securing the gourd, he began to climb the bamboo, only to find that those seemingly fragile bamboo branches, which looked as if a child could easily snap them, were surprisingly resilient.

Chen Ping'an turned his gaze toward the distant temple, where Huang Shi stood atop a wall, having watched this scene for quite some time.

“Late to realize,” Chen Ping'an smiled and waved his hand.

Huang Shi stepped off the wall and returned to the ground.

What a pathetic creature, obsessed with wealth yet unable to find a way to obtain it.

With Huang Shi's gaze now diverted, Chen Ping'an tested the bending bamboo branches, managing to pluck some leaves. With his current cultivation level, he could barely accomplish this, gathering one handful after another and stuffing them into a side satchel, forcefully filling the once-deflated bag.

Switching positions, he continued observing the martial artist Huang Shi, feeling truly impressed. If this person were the rumored hidden immortal, Huang Shi would willingly offer his neck to the law of the sword.

Once Huang Shi truly departed, Chen Ping'an quickly aligned his fingers, striking swiftly to sever the varying thicknesses of bamboo branches, swiftly storing them in his pocket.

The items in his satchel were now truly packed.

After completing his task, Chen Ping'an remained by the green bamboo for a while, not yet eager to touch the ground.

He vaguely recalled the time in his youth, climbing trees to catch cicadas with two others; one was his closest friend who always protected him, and the other was a half-relative he had grown accustomed to safeguarding.

Back then, life seemed impoverished, yet each year, month after month, they were carefree and worry-free.

Chen Ping'an sighed.

Retrieving his thoughts, a teasing voice suddenly called out from the distance, “Old Chen? What are you doing?”

Turning to look, Chen Ping'an laughed heartily, “Just enjoying the cool breeze and the beautiful view!”

It was Di Yuanfeng, disguised as Qin Juyuan, whose complexion was slightly pale, likely due to suffering some injuries.

“Juyuan, great ape?” 

The largest species of monkey in the world, was it not the mountain-moving ape?

That name had a rather annoying ring to it.

Di Yuanfeng paid no heed to the black-robed elder, instead directing his gaze toward the nearest temple complex and inquired, “How did Daoist Sun and Brother Huang fare?”

Chen Ping'an replied with a smile, “We all did well.”

Di Yuanfeng couldn’t resist glancing at the old man clutching the bamboo, with two cross-body bags filled with either tiles or bricks, wondering, what's the hurry to go home and build a house or marry?

Unfortunately, Chen Ping'an could not guess his thoughts.

Otherwise, he would have genuinely given him a thumbs up, sincerely praising him as a true immortal.

The old immortal Huan Yun had returned with a full load, a talisman-sized item already packed to the brim.

The old offering from the Cloud City was also satisfied, carrying a large bag on his back, with two additional bundles in his hands, his face brimming with joy.

The two old men met atop a loft, overlooking the battlefield at the mountain gate.

The old offering chuckled, “What a dog-eat-dog situation.”

Huan Yun smiled in response, saying nothing.

On the path of cultivation, a single misstep can lead to multiple missteps.

If the two direct disciples of Shen Zhenze had not been guarded, and had entered this place first, they would have been forced to engage in deadly combat with the group led by the young marquis from North Ting.

However, Huan Yun was sharp-eyed and quickly discerned the telltale signs of the two major practitioners from Cai Que Mansion, most likely the immortal Sun Qing and the law master Wu Jun.

As for the young female practitioner floating in the air, holding the ancient zither, it was evident that she wielded the “Falling Snow” zither, carved long ago by a master.

Yet this zither had once belonged to a female Nascent Soul practitioner of the Water Dragon Sect, who had engaged in a legendary battle by the waters, using the zither and terrain to outmaneuver an old Nascent Soul rival.

Now, in the hands of the Water Dragon Sect's female practitioner, it was only displaying about fifty to sixty percent of its unique abilities.

The old offering quietly asked, “Should we take a detour to the algae well and leave quietly, or go take another look at the back mountain?”

Huan Yun smiled, “We are the protectors; let those two youngsters decide. We just need to remain hidden and not actively get involved. This journey should pose no worries.”

Huan Yun glanced at the sky above, his gaze drifting to the distant border of this small realm.

Bai Bi had already noticed something unusual, but the old immortal had certainly confirmed it far earlier.

However, there was a hidden talisman buried beneath the entrance of the algae well, and as long as it did not malfunction, it meant the escape route was still intact.

Although this place was filled with mysteries and intricacies, it appeared devoid of any filth or malevolence, a comforting thought for the old immortal.

The spiritual energy of the land and water was the hardest to fabricate or disguise.

Even if a major demon from the Nascent Soul realm were to create a dazzling illusion of a celestial secret realm, it would still be detectable by someone skilled in talismans like Huan Yun, who could uncover the clues and recognize the situation early on.

In the vast world of the righteous path, there were once many factions flourishing, a vibrant scene.

However, many once-prominent branches had since faded away, their incense extinguished and no longer impactful, while some had gradually been lost to time.

For instance, the once-thriving sword immortal lineage of the Central Plains was truly a grand sight; back then, even with innumerable sword cultivators and standing sword immortals, they dared not claim to occupy eight parts of the world’s sword energy. 

In the past, the four notorious ghostly figures of the mountain had shared a place with the sword cultivators and blade masters. At that time, the Daoist sword immortals did not regard themselves simply as sword cultivators.

Huan Yun lamented the changes in the righteous path, observing the bloody chaos unfolding at the foot of the mountain, feeling a deep sense of regret.

In the eyes of the old immortal, those fighting for opportunities at the mountain gate were merely children.

Unbidden, he recalled a poet’s words: “In the eyes of a child, the world is vast and rugged.”

Later generations would annotate this line, noting that “rugged” was the antonym of “magnanimous,” thus revealing the fickleness of human emotions and the treacherous paths of the heart—far more perilous than the steep roads of a thousand miles.

Huan Yun suddenly said, “You go protect them in seeking opportunities in the future; I will go down to the foot of the mountain and try to mediate, saving as many lives as possible.”

The old offering hesitated, caught in thought. After weighing the situation, he understood the old immortal’s good intentions and nodded in agreement.

Unless the group from Cloud City left quickly, if the chaos at the foot of the mountain escalated, especially if the Water Dragon Sect’s direct disciple fell, the wrath of their Golden Core elders would surely thunder down upon North Ting and Fuhua Kingdom, ensnaring Cai Que Mansion and Cloud City without a doubt. 

Whoever gained the most today would bear the heaviest burden.

Moreover, if the old immortal could help break the deadlock between both sides, allowing them to sit down and negotiate a viable solution, it would earn him the favor of the Water Dragon Sect, Cai Que Mansion, and North Ting Kingdom alike.

Huan Yun handed a talisman to the old offering from Cloud City, saying, “In case of trouble, activate this talisman and I will arrive immediately.”

The old offering accepted the talisman, vanishing in a flash.

Huan Yun’s mood was not light—“Going to mediate is easy, but doing it well is hard. It’s not just about the mediator's realm; understanding the timing of human hearts is key.”

After Huan Yun took action, he neither assisted one side nor the other. With talismans at the ready, he aimed to prevent the two groups from continuing their slaughter.

At the same time, he appealed to their emotions, explaining that there were many opportunities on the mountain. If they could still trust him, Huan Yun, they might as well join forces to search for treasures instead of fighting to their mutual destruction.

The once-chaotic battle situation suddenly transformed, like turbulent waters flowing into a large lake, quickly calming down.

Especially as Huan Yun called upon five individuals to hold a secret discussion.

Among them were Zhan Qing, the young marquis of North Ting Kingdom, Sun Qing from Cai Que Mansion, Bai Bi of the Water Dragon Sect, and two of the most formidable leaders among the mountain dwellers.

Thus, they devised a plan for both sides to take a step back from the bridge, of course, Zhan Qing and Bai Bi's side would concede more. The reasoning was simple: if the battle continued, the only survivor from their side might end up being Bai Bi, who would be forced to flee.

Meanwhile, the other side was bound to see very few survivors, at most ten, and with bad luck, perhaps only a handful.

Therefore, Huan Yun’s appearance was a tremendous boon for both parties.

Otherwise, they would find themselves in an awkward situation, unable to escape without shattering one another’s heads.

At the same time, under Huan Yun’s lead, they roughly agreed on compensation for those who had fallen in battle.

During a secret conversation between Huan Yun and Bai Bi, the latter even took out a sum of celestial money on the spot to hand to three others, allowing them to negotiate the distribution of this compensation.

On Zhan Qing and Bai Bi’s side, they had lost a family offering, while Gao Ling was also heavily injured, his precious rain armor on the verge of collapsing. The Fuhua royal offering wasn’t in much better shape either.

Zhan Qing himself had even lost the secret treasure folding fan that had not yet been refined into his life’s essence; he had no idea whether it had fallen into the river or had been secretly taken by some unscrupulous bastard.

The young marquis, with his hair disheveled and his robe tattered, no longer bore the demeanor of a noble family heir.

However, the family had lost a pillar of strength in the form of a seventh realm martial artist.

Zhan Qing neither complained nor sought to vindicate himself against Bai Bi; instead, he maintained a calm expression, leaving all decision-making power in Bai Bi’s hands.

This left Bai Bi feeling quite gratified.

During this time, Sun Qing took the initiative to communicate with Bai Bi, who was at a disadvantage, through their thoughts, “As for the ownership of this place, our Cai Que Mansion is willing to help you wait until the elders of the Water Dragon Sect arrive, doing our utmost to prevent Cloud City from alerting other sects. But if Shen Zhenze from Cloud City arrives with other major practitioners first, don’t blame our Cai Que practitioners for withdrawing.”

This single sentence greatly changed Bai Bi’s impression of this Cai Que Mansion master.

Previously, both sides had been holding back, and apart from the old immortal Huan Yun, it was likely no one else had noticed. Thus, after they established a verbal alliance, Bai Bi began to contemplate forming a private friendship with Cai Que Mansion in the future.

Seeing that both sides had roughly come to an agreement, Huan Yun felt a sense of relief.

Mediating is easy but doing it well is quite challenging. It requires not only the mediator's level of cultivation but also the skillful grasp of human emotions.

At the old temple site on the mountaintop, a towering old man appeared out of nowhere, glancing at the mounds of debris from the temple ruins, shaking his head with a smirk as he slowly walked toward the top steps. “Do you children think this is the end? Is there such easy treasure to be taken in this world? People kill one another at most, driven by their desires. Otherwise, what joy would there be in watching you children brawl?”

He lightly stamped his foot.

Upon reaching the steps, he peered down at the ceasefire between the two sides, casting a quick glance before his ethereal figure was instantly shattered by a wisp of sword energy.

Yet the emerald river at the foot of the mountain began to exhibit strange phenomena. Initially, it rippled gently, but soon it started to bubble violently.

Huan Yun was the first to notice the unusual signs, his sleeves fluttering as talismans flew out like water.

In the blink of an eye, the river beneath the bridge fell silent, and then two figures emerged, standing on either side of the white jade bridge—each was a towering figure of five meters tall. One was a deity clad in green, wielding a silver spear, while the other held a heavy iron club. 

Simultaneously, the white jade bridge shrouded in mist solidified into a white-clad goddess with golden eyes, her expression unreadable as she held a scroll that resembled a Taoist decree. 

She floated gracefully, unfurling the scroll, her voice heavenly as she began to speak slowly.

Even the well-read old immortal Huan Yun found the words of this white-clad goddess absurd, yet he couldn’t help but feel a sense of belief.

The gist was that this place was where an ancient immortal had attained enlightenment and ascended, once ranked as the thirty-sixth cave heaven and seventy-first blessed land. It was a pure and serene realm, and their reckless intrusion was both a chance and a crime. 

Before ascending, the immortal had left behind a decree for the three of them, promising future cultivators that based on the number of treasures they obtained, the size of their opportunities would be determined. Ultimately, five individuals would remain, allowing them to keep all the heavenly materials and earthly treasures they had gathered, while the leader among them could inherit the status of the ascendant immortal, with the rest temporarily registered as disciples, receiving a teaching that pointed directly to immortality.

Within a span of ten days, only five could survive; otherwise, all would be forfeit, and they would face heavenly retribution, struck down at the scene. As disciples, if they could not cleanse the impurities for their master, they were not worthy of such a fate.

Once the scroll unfurled, it expanded like a cascading waterfall, dropping from the heavens to the ground.

The scroll depicted portraits of five individuals.

These were the five currently holding the most treasures and fortunes.

Apart from this water screen, at various locations on the mountain and behind it, smaller screens hung in the air wherever people were present.

The white-clad goddess's voice, while soft, resonated throughout the realm, reaching every ear.

The young male practitioner carrying the white jade pen tube from Cloud City stared in disbelief; he was among those listed, and his rank was not low—he placed second.

Beside him, the female practitioner felt a mix of happiness and worry.

The one at the bottom was a young gentleman with a sword.

Di Yuanfeng.

This handsome young man, whose complexion was slightly pale, was left speechless.

In the fourth position was a disheveled man who stood before the stone tablet in the temple, arms crossed and eyes squinted.

The third was the tall, thin Daoist who had been using a robe as a bag.

It was none other than Sun Daoren, who claimed to be the disciple of the Thunder God’s abode.

At this moment, the tall Daoist was sweating profusely.

And the one in first place?

It was the black-robed elder, who was currently levitating with a bamboo in his arms.

Chen Ping'an.

As everyone gazed at the mural, he still refused to touch the ground, scratching his head with a sincere expression, addressing the floating landscape scroll beside him, “What’s going on here? You’ve got it all wrong, truly all wrong.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 643: Those Aboard the Vessel Face the Enemy Nation (Part One)

The White-Clad Goddess and the two Green-Clad Deities had already dissipated.

After half a shichen (a period of two hours), the water curtain would appear once more. If a full shichen passed and the number of remaining people here exceeded five, a heavenly calamity would descend, killing everyone present.

Huan Yun discovered that the talismans buried in the moss-covered beams had shattered, indicating that the mountain and river spirits of this place had closed off the exit to the immortal abode.

On the side of the White Jade Arch Bridge, a variety of cultivators and martial artists, mixed together like fish and dragons, exchanged glances. The fragile unity Huan Yun had painstakingly fostered moments ago was instantly shattered, returning to a state of disarray. Even with six people left, they all unconsciously stepped back, creating distance between each other.

Only Bai Bi and Zhan Qing stood side by side, silently communicating.

In an instant, the world fell into silence, the sound of a pin drop could be heard.

The young couple from Cloud City (Yunshang Cheng) grew increasingly heavy-hearted. The young woman asked, “Senior Brother, can Huan Laozhen (Old Man Huan) protect us?”

The young man forced a bitter smile. “Perhaps Old Man Huan is unwilling to kill us, and that would already be a great kindness.”

The young woman's face paled.

The young man sighed helplessly. “In the end, Huan Yun is not one of our own. The only one we can trust now is Xu Gongfu (Lord Xu).”

After a moment, the two pondered their predicament, trying to break the current deadlock, but unfortunately, they could not come up with a solution.

The dusty figure of the Dragon Gate's protector, who had hurried over, stood beside them, his expression grave as he slowly spoke, “Why not hand that white jade pen tube to me? I will draw everyone’s attention away.”

Without hesitation, the young man handed over the small item, expressing his gratitude, “Thank you, Xu Gongfu.”

The old protector carefully stowed the white jade pen tube into his sleeve and departed.

The young woman looked on in surprise.

The young man shook his head, signaling her to remain silent. Although the young woman was not as composed and meticulous as her senior brother and had often been scolded by the city lord Shen Zhenze, she understood that handing over the small item at this moment was definitely not a good thing.

The young man communicated through thought, “If we hadn’t handed it over, we would have already become two corpses by now. After half a shichen, if we and this Tao Gongfu can survive until then, just wait— the item will return to its rightful owner.”

The young woman said anxiously, “So, we just wait until the water curtain disappears and it gets taken away?”

The young man chuckled, “What else can we do?”

Tears welled in the young woman's eyes.

The young man gently wiped her tears, his movements tender, but he remained silent. It wasn't that he didn't want to say something; rather, there was nothing to say.

Under the green bamboo on the back mountain, Di Yuanfeng's expression was solemn. He glanced up, clearly having no intention of provoking the old man in black robes, planning to stay as far away as possible.

Without hesitation, Di Yuanfeng dashed down the mountain, bypassing the palace complex.

Chen Ping'an slid down a bamboo pole and, passing by the palace buildings, noticed that Huang Shi was completely silent, unsure of what to make of it.

Daoist Sun removed two bundles, placing them at his feet. He didn't dare to simply abandon his belongings and flee, worried that someone might beat the old master to death, leaving him with no way to explain himself. As a rogue cultivator at the Sea Viewing level, he simply wasn’t strong enough.

Daoist Sun could only gamble that a group of people would notice him, take what they saw as good fortune, and not take his life.

At this moment, even if he were truly the immortal teacher of the Infant Mountain Thunder God’s abode, what good would it do? None at all.

After witnessing this scene, Chen Ping'an thought to himself that the old man had finally shown some wisdom. He hadn't abandoned his treasures and made a run for it.

Daoist Sun looked up with tearful eyes, pitifully gazing at Chen Ping'an, who stood atop the wall, before waving his hand, “Let’s go, let’s get as far away as possible.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Take care.”

However, before leaving, he tossed over three talismans, all of which were concealment talismans. 

Gifting him offensive talismans wouldn't hold much meaning anymore.

After explaining the use of the talismans with his thoughts, Chen Ping'an also hastily fled down the mountain.

After catching the talismans, Daoist Sun looked up again, and the figure of Chen Ping'an atop the wall had already vanished. He sighed, “Adversity reveals true hearts.”

Chen Ping'an only hoped that Daoist Sun had given up his chance at treasure and could temporarily keep his life.

After that, there was indeed a glimmer of hope.

The Lotus Flower Blessed Land had also been in a similar predicament back in the day. After a chaotic battle that darkened the sky, the Arm Saint Cheng Yuanshan, without having to fight at all, not only survived until the end but if he hadn’t missed the chance to reach the city’s peak, he would have easily acquired the fortune of ascending to the Great Harmony Realm.

As for whether five people would ultimately survive—he found it hard to believe they could have such incredible luck, being accepted as direct disciples or named disciples by some high-level ascendant.

On the path of cultivation, opportunities often seemed most enticing when linked to treasures, making it appear that the more opportunities one had, the more they were cut out for cultivation.

However, Chen Ping'an understood that for those at higher realms, evaluating disciples required considering their foundational skills, talents, temperament, and opportunities—all aspects were indispensable.

When an ancient ascendant took on disciples, especially those of direct lineage, they would not merely consider how many treasures the future disciple acquired in the mountains.

Everywhere was fraught with hidden dangers. If previously, seeking treasures and opportunities felt like the reasonable calculations of rogue cultivators, now the environment forced everyone to turn against each other, where anyone could die at the hands of their neighbors. The one in control here was obviously no kind-hearted soul, possibly even deliberately inciting discord to let the remaining forty or so people slaughter each other, allowing him to reap the benefits.

With the sudden shattering of Daoist Sun's pagoda bell, Chen Ping'an even speculated that the mastermind behind this place might be a great demon, only hampered by certain old rules, unable to act freely. The presence of that fierce sword energy could very well be a form of restraint.

Chen Ping'an suddenly recalled a conversation he’d had with Cui Qian on the steps of the Falling-Into-Poverty Mountain.

Cui Qian had expressed great certainty about the state of the world, and at that time, Chen Ping'an had wanted to ask the Grand Master of the Great Li why he didn’t inform certain people or directly proclaim the matter to the world.

However, he had held back the question, eventually finding his answer: it was because no one would listen, and even if they did, they wouldn’t believe it.

Chen Ping'an hadn’t strayed far from the area of Daoist Sun’s building. 

However, he had done some calculations.

Should he break the heavenly curtain with his sword immediately?

This was a choice that could very well determine life or death. 

Because after witnessing the supernatural events of this site, his understanding of the hidden “Heaven” behind the scenes had heightened. When he had successfully escaped from the Ghost Valley, it had been a sudden and unforeseen event, catching the higher powers of Jingguan City off guard. But the one here might have already started to keep a close watch on Chen Ping'an.

Thus, he had a more moderate idea.

Like that Arm Saint Cheng Yuanshan from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, he should hide until half a shichen later; at that time, whether it was fortune or disaster, the intentions of the one behind this would become clear.

Deciding whether to draw his sword would then be much easier.

Huang Shi emerged from around the corner, puzzled. “You’re so concerned about Daoist Sun’s life? Worried I might kill this so-called Thunder God’s abode immortal with a punch?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “What do you think?”

Huang Shi smirked, “Why don’t we join forces to fend off the enemy?”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Aren’t you afraid I’ll drag you down?”

Huang Shi’s suspicion deepened, and he could no longer restrain himself from asking, “What realm are you in, exactly? A Dragon Gate cultivator proficient in talismans or a Golden Core Earth Immortal?”

Chen Ping'an countered, “What about you?”

Huang Shi honestly replied, “I’m just an average Golden Body martial artist, with a major vendetta to settle, so I can’t die.”

Chen Ping'an said, “Then treat me as a Golden Core cultivator, well, an average one.”

After pondering for a moment, Huang Shi said, “Let’s retreat from this mountain first. We should strive not to be encircled and killed. This is undoubtedly the worst-case scenario, but considering our current situation, it’s not wrong to think negatively.”

Chen Ping'an inquired, “Why not learn from Daoist Sun and just hand over the treasure?”

Huang Shi scoffed, “What? Do you think those so-called immortal teachers are all compassionate? Or are you hoping the mountain and field cultivators suddenly become good and willing to sacrifice themselves to be righteous?”

Chen Ping'an rubbed his chin, seemingly considering whether to sincerely cooperate with Huang Shi to overcome the crisis.

Huang Shi urged, “Opportunities like this don’t come often. If we keep hesitating, it’ll just increase our danger.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Let’s forget it. I’m afraid you’ll sneak in another punch. My old bones can’t take it.”

Huang Shi shook his head, “You’ll definitely die before I do.”

After saying that, Huang Shi took a few steps back and disappeared around the corner.

Chen Ping'an then affixed another concealment talisman to himself, searching for a secluded place. He donned a simple blue shirt; the three layers of robes combined with the ordinary shirt made him look somewhat bulky, but it was winter, and it made sense to dress warmly.

He changed the old man's face for that of a youth and adopted the posture of Zhu Lian's monkey fist style, slightly bending over to appear a bit shorter. He then removed the two slung bags he had and buried them underground, while the sword immortal and the sword nurturing gourd were also taken off and placed into the small item.

At this point, Chen Ping'an felt that, aside from his resentment towards the imitation swords from Sword Mountain, he would also need to acquire another small item in the future.

Next, Chen Ping'an planned to follow the river along the foot of the mountain, circling back to the front mountain, and then find an opportunity to check out the White Jade Arch Bridge without rushing.

The phrase “a tree stands out in the forest, only to be cut down” captures two meanings.

Since he had once explained this principle to Gu Can at the Book Lake, Chen Ping'an himself would naturally be even more adept at it.

Choosing to travel together with Daoist Sun or whatever he would do next, all would be efforts made based on this principle.

Cui Dongshan once said something very thought-provoking.

The principles at both ends of a line, once unraveled and understood, are like two sides after a fight, ultimately landing in the middle—that is the moment of “true knowledge.”

Otherwise, reasoning would not be reasoning; once taken from the world outside the belly, it’s all nonsense, woe upon woe.

During that journey through the Great Sui, Cui Dongshan had playfully said many such careless words and jokes, but perhaps he had been too cynical and flippant at the time, causing Chen Ping'an to not take them in.

Reflecting later, he realized it was the student teaching the teacher.

A tall old man slowly strolled along the borders of that small world.

Time and again, sword energy shredded his ethereal form, only for him to gather anew, one unperturbed, the other indifferent.

The old man, of course, knew the cleverness behind this setup.

Each possible outcome, even the hearts of those little fellows, was uncertain. At a critical moment of life and death, and with the hope of obtaining immortal inheritance looming, great misfortune and great fortune were intertwined; thus, everyone’s words and deeds would extend into various unexpected possibilities, interweaving strategies, calculating against each other, making it hard to distinguish friend from foe, and leading to hidden patience or reckless violence.

Simply determining who to find first, who to kill, and how to kill was an endless array of delightful appetizers.

If it weren't for the numerous remnants of rules in this little world, one of which resembled an insurmountable thunder pool, he might have already refined the entire mountain and river, instead of repeatedly approaching the verdant hills and clear waters, bound by constraints. Once he truly took hold of this little world, he would likely have cultivated a Dao fruit of a round heaven and square earth.

But after so many years of trials and tribulations, he could only select a few lowly ants to fill his belly; it was not entirely a bad thing. He used the thoughts of others to temper his own Dao heart, and through repeated experiences, he gained deep insights into the word “truth.”

After this hearty meal, he would have to move again to avoid being discovered by the nearby sects of North Julu Prefecture.

He couldn’t go to the Central Earth Divine Continent; there were too many high-level cultivators. The northern snowy continent was a decent choice.

As for the southern Baoping Continent, he had previously overheard those cultivators chatting on the mountain peaks; unless one took a detour, they would have to pass through the Northern Peaks' territory. Once that Northern Peaks' deity entered the Jade Purity realm, it would be akin to a cultivator at the Immortal realm.

That would be quite troublesome.

Especially since the other party was a mountain god, it would be even more challenging for him to completely hide his tracks. 

He couldn’t very well become a minor protector for the Song clan of the Great Li, could he? If he had known earlier, when the new mountain god of Baoping Continent had not been confirmed, it would have been a good choice to fish for a mountain deity.

The old man was probably truly weary of the persistent entanglement of that strand of sword energy, so he retreated into the mist and sat cross-legged, surrounded by origami cranes that circled around him.

The entrance to this ruin, painted with four murals of heavenly kings, was actually an artifact from another shattered mountain peak, which he had refined and piled together. In truth, he had refined more than just this mountain. Thus, next time, when new opportunities emerged elsewhere, it would present a different scene altogether.

Once suitable lowly cultivators entered the mountain and accidentally stumbled upon it, he would intentionally set up a low-level restriction to prevent Earth Immortal cultivators from taking too much interest, at most attracting someone like Bai Bi from the Water Dragon Sect or Huan Yun, who merely served as protectors. It wasn’t that the old man couldn’t consume one or two Nascent Souls rolling around in his belly; it was simply that caution was key.

Thus, the inscriptions on those walls were all written by the old man himself.

They were meant to deal with those who thought too highly of themselves.

Later, as the fifty or so people entered, they were simply too foolish, far less clever than the first three batches of cultivators. He simply removed all restrictions, employing a small trick, leading someone to rush ahead, and thus everyone followed suit.

Human nature had always surprised him.

The first batch entering the immortal’s cave, upon raising their heads, saw cranes circling; it was also a small clever trick.

Cultivators in the world, each one suspicious of others, if he didn’t create some spectacle, either they would be too foolish to take the bait or too frightened to dare nibble.

It was rather laughable.

If all those entering the mountain were filled with righteous spirit, refusing to kill one another and each taking their treasures, he would truly have no way to deal with them; at most, he could close the gates and let those cultivators age and die within.

The two corpses playing chess in the pavilion had long been in such a situation.

It wasn’t that killing couldn’t happen; rather, it would be too costly.

Once his true self was revealed, that strand of residual sword energy would not show any mercy, and could even trace back to kill him within the vast white mist.

The old man had suffered greatly twice during the long years of hiding.

Relying on his realm to kill, like a child smashing an anthill with a stick, the old man had done too much in a foreign land, ultimately running into that deity from a Daoist temple, which was why he had fallen to this state.

For the old man, the numerous palaces, heavens, treasures, and secret tomes on the mountain no longer held much meaning. His primary goal was still to prepare for the future, waiting for his own realm to reach a point where he could protect himself in any continent of the Great Harmony World, at which point he would establish a sect. By then, all treasures and opportunities would be the foundation of his sect. Those of too poor quality, he truly looked down upon; after being shattered, returning to heaven and earth to transform into spiritual energy was also acceptable.

This place was rich in spiritual energy, especially with the dense water element—not something that existed from the beginning.

The old man was genuinely concerned with people other than the three Golden Core Earth Immortals.

One had been too lucky, and thus luck had turned against him.

He had inexplicably gained three points of opportunity from the mountain peak’s Daoist temple: a shattered wooden deity statue, a green glazed tile refined by an immortal, and the blue bricks of the ground infused with water energy.

There were also two others; one was someone he had unprecedentedly considered taking as a disciple, who indeed had some connection to the mountain’s destiny. If they truly became master and disciple, with the disciple’s realm soaring, they would work together in the future, making it much easier for him.

Perhaps even the Nascent Soul could be casually consumed, leading to the master achieving Dao fruit, and the disciple gaining both Golden Core and Nascent Soul treasures, benefiting all, reaching the peak in the Great Harmony World. Perhaps one day, he could even return home in glory, shocking those arrogant old Daoists who looked down on him.

The other was the most intriguing and, thus, the one who had to die.

Moreover, it was likely he wouldn’t even have to lift a finger.

By then, when only five remained, killing a few more would happen naturally and without effort.

In truth, if those people could work together sincerely, abandoning biases to break the deadlock, coupled with the presence of that strand of sword energy, he would have much more trouble.

He could only “stomach” the journey, slowly waiting for those fellows to age and die in this belly-like cave, their entire cultivation transforming into spiritual energy, returning to the small world.

But was that even possible?

Absolutely not.

Even if they were so close-knit, one of them would eventually emerge as a likely candidate for the Jade Purity realm’s Nascent Soul.

If it truly came to that, all it would take was him paying a price to personally eliminate them.

As heaven and earth converged, calamity loomed.

This was no casual joke made by those three paper deities.

If anyone could gain the approval of that strand of sword energy, it would be the biggest trouble.

A colossal problem.

Fortunately, for now, there seemed to be no such destined person.

Since he was temporarily unoccupied,

The old man opened a book with pages as thin as cicada wings, the contents written in fine, nearly invisible script, interspersed with pages of cultivator portraits.

In addition, it was a chapter-based novel.

Each chapter detailed a cultivator’s experiences and life and death in this place, with meticulous descriptions of every action they took here, recorded word for word, though the lengths of the stories varied.

It seemed as if everyone was a protagonist, but everyone would die.

This had been the old man’s most important cultivation path for countless years, secretly refining famous mountains and rivers.

Within the vast white mist, under the mountain and water realm, every detail was vividly revealed.

This was the truly superior view of the mountains and rivers by a divine being.

The current sage controlling the small world was not a method learned from the three teachings; it was learned elsewhere.

What the tall old man most wanted to visit was not some sage of the three teachings, but the novelists among the various schools of thought who resided in the white paper blessed land.

Surely, they could mutually benefit each other’s paths, a fine example of sharpening each other’s skills.

The scholars of this world placed great importance on their words.

The tall old man raised his head, looking towards the direction of the Daoist temple atop the green mountain, filled with emotions.

He recalled the years he followed that person in cultivation; the mountain was sparsely populated, but books were plentiful, with an extensive library. He had read widely.

Once, that person had rarely spoken up, asking how his reading was going.

He replied, “Reading the Daoist classics, there’s life in death, which feels a bit cold. Reading Buddhist texts, there’s joy in suffering, which feels a bit warm. Reading Confucian teachings, everything is formal and proper, which feels a bit tedious.”

That person then laughed, saying, “You’ve taken some in, but you haven’t truly understood. In the deep mountains, one sees the mountain but not the people; that's not necessarily good.”

Before he could read more, a stunning event unfolded with a sword thrust, sword energy pouring like rain.

That one sword, even now, made one feel a chill down the spine and a splitting headache.

Before that person passed away, in order to break the heavenly curtain, he sent this small world, which had switched masters multiple times, along with himself, back to his homeland and the world. In truth, he could no longer restrain himself any further, and could only set three rules for himself.

Years passed; those so-called rules were no longer restrictions. Now, only that strand of sword energy remained, still desperately holding on.

As cultivators from this world entered, such as the martial artist Huang Shi, acting increasingly recklessly, breaking the wooden statues time and again, he would then patch them back together, and the last remnants of his awe for that person gradually diminished.

The old man casually glanced into the distance.

If anyone dared to spoil his heart-observing game, such as suppressing everyone with brute force, then they could die first.

It would serve as a warning to others, allowing those little brats to believe even more that this place was the domain of some ancient ascendant.

Paying a price would only mean consuming the superficial cultivation he had built up over decades; for someone like him, time was not valuable. Tempering his Dao heart and cultivating his methods was what truly mattered.

Those who had the opportunity to do so had not taken action.

Those incapable of doing so, were merely pretending to be brave; for instance, the young lord Zhan Qing was simply ridiculed, making one mistake after another—he was destined not to live long, and perhaps he would die a rather tragic death.

Perhaps at the hands of some lowly ant?

Or perhaps it could be arranged for this little fellow to perish at the hands of his beloved Sister Bai?

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 644: The People on the Boat are All Enemies (Part 2)

Near the White Jade Arch Bridge, the battle has ceased, transforming into a chaotic struggle of wills far more perilous than before.

The elder Huan Yun stood surrounded by a circle of talismanic formations. Bai Bi held the ancient guqin "Scattered Snow" in his arms, and the eighteen precious snowflakes he possessed were still unsheathed, showing no intention of retreat. The atmosphere around them was filled with rippling energy, chaotic to the extreme, which effectively cut off all other cultivators' prying eyes.

After the six of them steadied themselves, they began to exchange their thoughts. The elder Huan Yun, Sun Qing from the Colorful Sparrow Sect, and Bai Bi from the Water Dragon Sect were the only ones who seemed to have the opportunity and strength to survive until the end. Yet, each of the three harbored their own concerns. Sun Qing was worried about Wu Qian and her disciple. Bai Bi's thoughts were with Zhan Qing. Huan Yun had to protect the two direct disciples of Shen Zhenze.

The bonds of their sect traditions, the future partners on the path of enlightenment (Dao), and their own consciences weighed heavily on them. Thus, this situation was an extremely grueling moral dilemma for the three, no less so than for anyone else fighting desperately for survival.

Huan Yun had considered uniting everyone to resist the peculiar rules of this small world, but taking such risks could easily lead to an early demise. Sun Qing and Bai Bi likely felt the same. With no power to act, and perhaps not even the will to do so.

Bai Bi was the first to speak, "Let's find those five people first."

Sun Qing smiled, "And then what? What are we supposed to say to them once we find them?"

Bai Bi proposed, "We should at least locate that old man in the black robe, right?"

Sun Qing shook his head, "You think you can just kill someone like that once you find him? Will it be you, Bai Bi, leading the charge, or will our illustrious young lord take the lead himself?"

Soon, two others echoed Sun Qing’s sentiments.

Zhan Qing could only smile wryly. After being quickly eliminated in the first skirmish, everyone had aimed to kill him with all their might. Yet here was this comical old man, whom everyone seemed to regard with caution, making it clear that for now, they would not pursue him for a hunt.

Huan Yun hesitated before suggesting, "Let’s not kill anyone yet. We should just collect treasures, and for now, no one should take them; let’s leave them at the mountain top's Daoist temple."

A rough looking wild cultivator scoffed, "Isn’t that just like farting with your pants down? In the end, only five will survive. Let’s just do it swiftly; it’ll save them the torment."

Another elderly warrior nodded in agreement, "Dying early or late is still dying. Why not eliminate a group first? With the six of us, within half a day, each of us can protect four or five people. What do you say?"

These two were amongst those who supported Sun Qing.

Zhan Qing interjected, "Five is too many."

The wild cultivator clicked his tongue, "You and that woman beside you have no one to rely on, so of course you’d think it’s too many. According to the young lord's thinking, wouldn’t it be just right to spare two lives?"

Zhan Qing shook her sleeves dismissively, "You all can continue your discussion as if I’m not here."

Originally, Zhan Qing had wanted to suggest that everyone stop fighting and focus on those five before discussing further steps. Clearly, it was a wishful thought. She figured that whatever she said now would be futile.

Ignoring the five with the most treasures, there were still forty-two people alive.

Bai Bi said, "Then let’s each spare three, but let’s agree beforehand that I and Zhan Qing can rally two more people to protect them."

Huan Yun remained silent. After all, only three had come from Cloud City.

He, Huan Yun, was merely a temporary protector, not even a true disciple of those two young ones, nor was he a cultivator of Cloud City.

As for the lives of others, he truly could not afford to care about them.

Although Sun Qing was reluctant to get involved with these people, she did not voice her objections. Besides herself, Wu Qian and her disciple Liu Guibao, she had one more slot available.

The girl had already expressed her desire through their shared thoughts, pleading for Sun Qing to save one person—a stranger they had met on their journey.

It was nothing more than a fleeting infatuation.

Sun Qing did not feel anything was wrong with it. After all, she had once felt the same way upon meeting a young scholar.

If her master could feel that way, she had no right to scold her disciple about principles.

Suddenly, a wild warrior approached Sun Qing, using the technique of resonating thoughts: "I know you are Sun Qing, the head of the Colorful Sparrow Sect. My brother Chu and I don’t trust this young lord. Why don’t we join forces to persuade Elder Huan Yun to sit this one out? Let’s first eliminate Zhan Qing and her group. They don’t follow the rules, wilder than even the wild cultivators. After we kill them, Sun Qing, you will be our leader. Finally, my brother and I will deal with Huan Yun’s side. What do you think? In the end, we five will survive. Isn’t that stable?"

Sun Qing furrowed her brows. She neither agreed nor refused.

The warrior was not in a hurry. To him, Elder Huan Yun’s skills were high, and he should have been the best partner, but unfortunately, he was too much of a good-natured person, destined to not accomplish big things.

As for Zhan Qing and that Golden Core female cultivator, they were nothing but bad seeds, far less trustworthy than Sun Qing from the Colorful Sparrow Sect.

Moreover, recognizing Sun Qing’s identity, he was aware of her sufficient cultivation level, as well as the capabilities of her two followers.

As for Bai Bi from the Kingdom of Lotus, she had already made her identity clear before, but what did that matter? A direct descendant of the Water Dragon Sect? What of it? If she truly had the skills, how come she didn’t just kill them all in one go?

Zhan Qing had generally guessed the situation on her side.

Regret filled her heart as she realized what it meant to be a true noble cultivator, and what the innate shortcomings of the wild cultivators were.

At least one thing made Zhan Qing feel slightly better: eighteen people would soon die.

After all, neither she nor Bai Bi would lose anyone anymore, and they might even gain two temporary "sacrificial guests." In their group, every person who fell would increase their chances of survival.

On the waterside opposite the White Jade Arch Bridge, a young man, whose shoulder had grazed by an energy wave from Gao Ling’s punch, sat by the river looking pale and lost. 

Wearing a brocade robe, which had already become tattered from that overwhelming punch, he appeared quite disheveled.

A wild cultivator and his companion sat beside him. The burly man splashed water on his face and exhaled a mouthful of foul breath, then turned and comforted him with a smile, "Don’t worry, Young Master Huai. There’s always a way out. I believe you are destined for greatness. Just look at this journey; haven’t you turned danger into safety? I say, such great fortune should have a share for you. My wife and I will just follow along and share it with you."

The young man, speaking in a slightly unrefined dialect from North Julu, murmured, "Those earlier skirmishes were merely the mischief of four or five realms’ monsters. If I hadn’t met you, I probably would have taken another route and wouldn’t have dared to fight. I just wanted to go to the academy to study, but I never expected to end up in such a dire situation. We are all going to die."

The woman frowned. 

What a pretty face, but completely useless — all she could do was spout gloomy remarks. 

They had tolerated him earlier because this out-of-towner had hinted at a connection with a certain teacher from the academy, which allowed him to enter and borrow books. 

This was a fifth-realm cultivator, just at the bottleneck of the lower five realms. Earlier, when fighting, he had been so full of blood and excitement, even taking a blow from the young lord of North Ting, yet he still didn’t know the heights of heaven and the depths of earth. Later, he had recklessly charged ahead and almost crashed into Gao Ling’s punch if not for a girl who had pushed him away.

Truly, he was a scholar.

A slender girl wiped her face, having walked a long way, and spat out several mouthfuls of blood before boldly sitting down beside the young scholar, saying, "Huai Qian, from now on, just stick with me and don’t worry about anything else."

The young man looked confused and whispered, "There’s still going to be fighting?"

The girl laughed, "Are you going to save me again like you did earlier on the bridge?"

The young man felt a bit embarrassed; it was hard to say who was saving whom.

The girl took out a wine flask from her waist and handed it over, "Drink a little, to steady your nerves?"

The young man shook his head, his face slightly red, "Liu Guniang, I can’t drink."

The girl drank instead, wiped her mouth, and looked up at the mountain peak, smiling, "Huai Qian, if you want to say ‘that’s against propriety’, just say it."

The young man was left speechless.

The girl was Liu Guibao, the most cherished direct disciple of Sun Qing, the Golden Core cultivator from the Colorful Sparrow Sect.

Everyone in the Colorful Sparrow Sect, including Wu Qian, believed that she would undoubtedly become the next sect leader.

Though still young, Liu Guibao was already a recognized genius among the cultivators on the mountain, having reached the Cave Dwelling stage.

Moreover, before Wu Qian took the first shot at Gao Ling, she had spoken twice, directly influencing the entire battle’s direction. In fact, Zhan Qing and Bai Bi held a certain resentment towards this seemingly low-level girl.

The young scholar, Huai Qian, had inexplicably gotten caught in this disaster.

Liu Guibao was quite fond of him, especially when he pretended to be a seasoned veteran, that faux cleverness made him quite endearing.

Perhaps it was Liu Guibao’s own precociousness; she found herself attracted to Huai Qian, who was unpretentious at his realm.

As her master often said, if one had to justify their affections, then it wasn’t true affection at all.

Whenever her master, drunk, would share stories about Mr. Liu and inadvertently mention such words, Liu Guibao would find it quite amusing.

On her master’s side, discussions had already concluded.

Liu Guibao felt somewhat dispirited.

They had already decided who to kill, and now it was just a matter of how and who would do the killing.

A clever person should be able to sense the signs.

Liu Guibao glanced around and noticed there were still few clever people among them.

Meanwhile, the six on her master’s side were still deeply engrossed in their scheming.

A man sat alone by the riverside, his hands and feet cold.

He kept a distance from everyone else; after all, being a lone wanderer who survived the earlier chaos was already a stroke of luck.

The man wore a pair of severely worn boots.

Someone suddenly called out, stating that the six had agreed to Zhan Qing’s proposal to eliminate all wild cultivators.

No one was quite sure, but no one dared to doubt it either.

After a moment of paralysis, people began to scatter, either flying away or using wind techniques to retreat from the White Jade Arch Bridge.

The one who spoke clearly lacked Liu Guibao's unique resonance technique and underestimated the sharp senses of the six across the river.

He was immediately targeted.

To avoid revealing too much, he had not moved first, waiting until most had dispersed before attempting to turn around. However, he was directly struck by a sharp dagger thrown by Gao Ling, piercing his skull and killing him instantly.

Zhan Qing had just wanted to stop it, but it was already too late.

Such lowly schemes of framing and slandering, the truth no longer mattered.

He felt that his treasure-seeking adventure, which he had approached with confidence, had turned into one unexpected event after another, leaving him somewhat numb.

Wu Qian’s expression was desolate, but she concealed it well.

The one who died was a pivotal figure from a minor mountain sect. He was one of the few elderly cultivators who had hoped to extend his life a few more years by relying on this immortal mansion’s ruins.

Thus, Wu Qian and this old cultivator, both knowing the inevitable, made a transaction.

Of course, Wu Qian would keep his word, and the Colorful Sparrow Sect would secretly support his small mountain sect, promising to cultivate at least three fifth-realm cultivators within a century, including the old cultivator’s closed-door disciple.

This was a reward that the old cultivator had exchanged his life for.

Among the six across the river, many were still bewildered.

But who had given the secret orders? Or had the old cultivator lost his mind and wanted to drag the young lord down with him? It all no longer mattered.

However, the fleeing crowd left the six with no choice but to pursue and kill.

High Ling would undoubtedly be the most relentless of them all.

This Golden Body cultivator was filled with rage and killing intent, having pent up his frustrations for far too long.

Even if he was severely injured, a warrior's physical resilience meant that dealing with small groups of fleeing enemies was still a piece of cake.

However, Liu Guibao and the young scholar Huai Qian did not run away; Wu Qian had also approached them, beginning to tend to their injuries.

There were still two groups left, both of whom were trembling but had not moved.

These were the two wild cultivators and martial masters from the other side.

Among the fleeing crowd, a wild cultivator was desperately trying to distance himself from others. After all, he trusted no one and felt that anyone could kill him.

The expensive thunder talisman he had bought with eight precious snowflakes had indeed saved his life during the skirmish by the White Jade Arch Bridge, but now he had no hidden skills or treasures left.

Suddenly, he heard a half-familiar voice behind him, "Pork killer?"

The man turned around in shock, not stopping, and cautiously asked, "Two of them?"

The person nodded with a smile.

The man nearly burst into tears on the spot.

Finally, a kindred spirit had arrived.

He slowed his pace slightly, "You won’t kill me, right?"

The stranger, a young man in a green shirt who had suddenly appeared on the market streets of Cloud City, shook his head, "Can killing you earn me money? Even if it could, could I compete with those big shots?"

The man sighed with relief and remained silent.

The two of them continued to sprint.

Suddenly, someone ahead caught sight of a patch of white mist and exclaimed in horror, "Is this the end?!"

The white mist receded like a tide.

The undulating hills revealed the true form of the immortal estate, rapidly expanding.

Huan Yun showed no intention of killing anyone; he took the lead and flew up the mountain to search for the two direct disciples of Shen Zhenze.

Sun Qing did not take action either but instructed Wu Qian and the others to head south to investigate.

Bai Bi and Zhan Qing allowed Gao Ling to kill freely, while the royal offering from the Kingdom of Lotus was summoned to Bai Bi’s side.

Gao Ling directly removed his sweet dew armor, hiding it in his sleeve, and took up a long knife from a dead master, sprinting away.

In the white mist, an old man had already put away his book, standing still, yet his body slid back with the mist, always concealed like a dragon in the sea of clouds. With his hands behind his back, he smiled and said, "If the territory is too small, I fear you will die too quickly, and I will miss out on many splendid performances."

After half a day, he would announce several intriguing new rules to everyone. For instance, from now on, the one who kills the most could become the second direct disciple of the immortal estate.

Then what about you, Huan Yun and Sun Qing, two kind-hearted cultivators who were reluctant to start killing? Would you still refrain from killing, or would you unleash a bloodbath without restraint?

The old man turned to look at a young man who had early on hidden himself at the boundary, burying his own sword, and said, "Let’s see if you have the fortune and fate to become my first disciple."

That young man, clad in straw sandals and a flowing white robe, upon discovering the shift in the boundary, cursed under his breath and had no choice but to break ground, rushing into the deep mountains.

Afterward, Huang Shi suddenly stopped, changed direction, squatted down at the pit, grabbed some soil, and looked up at a distant figure the size of a mustard seed, smiling.

Killing that old man in the black robe, Chen Daoyou, might be risky, but killing you, the fifth-realm warrior Di Yuanfeng, would be no challenge at all.

At the foot of the mountain, the five of them gave their orders and began to ascend, agreeing to meet at the mountain peak before searching for the remaining four individuals aside from the male and female cultivators from Cloud City.

Find them first, then decide whether to kill them.

In the deep mountains and forests, Chen Ping’an led a man named Jin Shan, escaping for their lives.

On another route, Gao Ling wielded his knife with extreme precision; anyone he caught up with faced a fate of severed limbs.

Due to needing to care for the scholar Huai Qian's pace, Wu Qian and Liu Guibao were moving slowly.

Meanwhile, the wild cultivators and the martial masters had already come together, energetically pursuing those fleeing.

Huan Yun assured the two young men and women, who were at their wits' end, that they need not worry for their lives and could either stay put or continue seeking treasures.

Then, Huan Yun discovered a hidden offering from the Dragon Gate realm, but the old man pretended not to notice and continued ascending the mountain.

At the top of the mountain, in the ruins of the Daoist temple, the green glazed tiles and the ground’s blue bricks, rich with water essence, left Bai Bi in shock.

However, Bai Bi also couldn’t help but smile wryly; this treasure was right at her feet, but she dared not take much. She merely dug out a blue brick, holding it in her hand, silently absorbing the water essence to replenish her depleted spiritual energy after the battle.

Then, under Huan Yun’s lead, the six quickly found the very agreeable Sun Daoist.

Regarding whether to spare this person’s life or not, the three against three remained in a deadlock.

Sun Daoist sat slumped on the ground, resigned to his fate.

In the end, it was the old warrior who made a joke, asking the Daoist to casually toss a piece of divine coin to see which side it lands on—heads meant life, tails meant death.

At the same time, the old warrior secretly communicated with the other five that if this fellow dared to manipulate the divine coin with spiritual energy, he would take action to kill.

Sun Daoist was extraordinarily fortunate; not only did he not reveal any clever tricks, but he also tossed the divine coin that rolled down the stairs, landing on its head.

The six allowed him to take the initiative to send the two wrapped bundles to the mountain peak's Daoist temple, after which he could wander as he pleased.

Sun Daoist’s eyes were dazed, almost forgetting to feel happy.

Bai Bi communicated through thoughts, "The black-robed old man with the most treasures—if he remains at the top of the list after half a day, we will dig three feet into the ground to find him and kill him together!"

This time, even Huan Yun and Sun Qing had no objections.

After the six departed, Sun Daoist carried the two bundles, heading up the mountain while wiping tears from his eyes.

As he passed that green bamboo, he unexpectedly felt a longing for the Chen Daoyou.

Meanwhile, Chen Daoyou, having confirmed that no one was behind him for the time being, leaped onto a thick branch of a towering ancient tree, gazing out in all directions.

The man had not dared to go up there, fearing he would be attacked by someone for no reason.

Chen Ping’an looked down at the man and said, "I can only take you this far. Staying with me will only bring you harm. Remember to use those two concealment talismans well—stick them on yourself and find a quiet place where you feel safe, then don’t move around too much."

Before the man could plead for him to stay, Chen Ping’an had already darted away, disappearing in an instant.

The man appeared panicked, not expecting five talismans to fall from above—each one was an offensive talisman, along with two unknown talismans.

He clutched those five talismans tightly, suddenly bursting into tears, but quickly stifled his cries and continued to hurry along.

Chen Ping’an found a peak with a broad view, adhered to the monument talisman, and stood silently, surveying his surroundings.

This treasure-seeking journey had been full of twists and turns, with many familiar faces, besides the wild cultivator named Jin Shan, and the old gentleman who helped him open his market.

He had even shared tea with the Colorful Sparrow Sect’s Grand Master, Wu Qian.

In fact, he had a good impression of them both.

But what followed was hard to say.

For early on, regardless of their nature or cultivation levels, whether seen as good or bad by the world, their actions would not seem strange to others. Even those who were killed might only harbor resentment and hatred, without much surprise.

Chen Ping’an found himself lost in thought.

Why was human nature so fragile under scrutiny?

Yet what truly made Chen Ping’an uncomfortable was not others’ hearts, but his own.

Since he had such thoughts, it meant he harbored such sentiments.

Now that he was in North Julu, he had been cultivating, trying to become a cultivator of the mountains, especially focusing on calming his heart.

Chen Ping’an suddenly recalled a saying from a Daoist text.

Afterward, a sage from the military who authored scriptures had his own unique interpretations and extensions.

Two sentences had been etched into a bamboo slip by Chen Ping’an.

The latter was, "The people on the boat are all enemies."

This served as a reminder to the sovereigns of secular kingdoms that national affairs should focus on cultivating virtue; the mountains and rivers’ dangers are not true barriers.

The Daoist saying was meant to convey a broader meaning.

Chen Ping’an felt that at present, including himself, everyone’s situation perfectly matched this saying.

"Hiding a boat in a ravine, concealing a mountain in a marsh, is said to be solid. But at midnight, those with strength can carry it away, while the ignorant remain unaware."

Chen Ping’an couldn’t help but ponder that being in this perilous small world, or even residing in the seemingly well-ordered Haoran world, may appear vastly different on the surface, but fundamentally, they could be the same.

In the shifting boat and ravine, no one knows.

Chen Ping’an suddenly began to understand just how rare the tranquility pursued by the Daoists truly was.

It was akin to a phantom boat navigating through emptiness—there's no one in front or behind, no one to the left or right; there’s no restraint of rules, nor entanglement of cause and effect.

Chen Ping’an sighed softly.

Some knowledge, when deeply examined, once truly grasped, can make one feel utterly alone and lost.

He began to breathe deeply, quietly accumulating energy.

Once the killing begins, he would first locate the root of his troubles—the old man with the talismans.

Half an hour later.

Eighteen certain deaths were about to occur, except for a seemingly inconspicuous wild cultivator who had remained alive.

Then, when the white-clad goddess and the two green-robed deities appeared again, opening the curtain of mountains and waters, many more lives were lost.

Because the divine decree clearly stated that the one with the most kills would have a chance to become the second direct disciple.

So the wild cultivator from the six and that martial master each ruthlessly turned on their friends and family, acting without hesitation.

Since they were destined to die, it was better for them to take matters into their own hands rather than leave it to others.

This scene left Liu Guibao with a frosty expression.

The young scholar, hiding behind Wu Qian and the girl, sighed, "Why must they act so brutally?"

As anticipated by the young man from Cloud City, just before the time drew near, their offering appeared beside the two, knocking the girl unconscious, then using a binding technique to imprison her, rendering her unable to speak or move. He placed a small item in her palm before stepping back, hiding nearby. All previous treasures and opportunities were temporarily concealed.

But that wasn’t what upset the young man the most.

What truly stung was that Elder Huan Yun had not shown himself during this critical moment.

He might have appeared somewhere, but the elder chose to observe coldly from the sidelines.

Thus, the young man from Cloud City found himself still in second place on the leaderboard.

The one at the bottom was the old man Huan Yun, who was indifferent to being on the list.

The fourth place was a beaming young man in white, bloodstained, who seemed to be in a refined study adorned with a yellowing gourd hanging on the wall.

This man did not forget to greet the painting with a wave, smiling, "Safe travels, everyone—go die."

Then he added, "Huang Shi, my brother, are you out there acting as my doorman? Much appreciated, wishing you longevity."

The third place belonged to a scruffy man who was hiding in a deep pit, sitting cross-legged, with branches and grass covering his head, concealed beneath dirt. However, the scene depicted in the scroll showed bright as day.

Huang Shi glanced at the painting and raised a middle finger.

Not only that, he suddenly stood up, jumped out of the pit, seemingly standing at the entrance of a cave, now obscured by colorful clouds and mist that lingered for a long time.

It turned out that Huang Shi had chased Di Yuanfeng all the way here, and the seriously injured Di Yuanfeng had unexpectedly not died but instead escaped into this place. Once Di Yuanfeng entered the cave shrouded in colorful clouds, Huang Shi found himself unable to break the restrictions.

So, Huang Shi planned to trap this little scoundrel.

As for Di Yuanfeng anticipating this move, that was within Huang Shi’s expectations.

The leader remained the old man in the black robe, seemingly hiding in a cave, still depicted clearly on the mountain and water scroll. Compared to earlier, he still bore his sword and carried two bags, showing no signs of change. The black-robed elder stared at the painting, appearing somewhat furious, his voice hoarse as he spoke, "What’s going on, still not done? Whoever dares to find me, I will kill them. I, with my swordsmanship, can even cut myself if I get angry!"

On the other side, Sun Daoist, who was prepared for death, sighed upon witnessing this scene.

He had been cautiously staying at the mountaintop these past few days, having only ventured to the back mountain, but returned disappointed.

During this half hour, various people had been transporting celestial materials and treasures to the mountaintop, creating another small mountain outside the Daoist temple ruins.

Sun Daoist now felt too lazy to spare another glance at that genuine treasure mountain.

All were disasters.

Sun Daoist shook the green porcelain bottle filled with water beads condensed from bamboo leaves, sipping sparingly, still having some left.

He had previously braved the walk to that green bamboo, only to find not a single drop left.

Sun Daoist couldn’t help but admire Chen Daoyou; not a single blade of grass remained along the way.

This wild cultivator, truly becoming a noble cultivator, would be a loss.

Liu Guibao stood beside the fortunate young scholar Huai Qian, both at the edge of the mountaintop railing, and Huai Qian had already noticed the black-robed elder for the second time, muttering to himself, "This fellow has some skill."

Liu Guibao, ears perked, inquired, "What do you mean by that?"

Huai Qian thought for a moment and smiled, "Just the literal meaning."

Liu Guibao was taken aback, "Huai Qian, are you hiding something?"

Huai Qian cautiously replied, "Yes. Back home, there’s a betrothal arranged by my family’s elders; I actually came here to escape the marriage."

Liu Guibao laughed, "How about the girl?"

Huai Qian replied helplessly, "I’ve only met her once, my impression is vague. I just thought her temperament was decent, but she’s a martial artist, even fiercer than me. To escape the marriage, she ran off to the Golden Armored Continent early."

Liu Guibao responded with an "Oh."

Huai Qian felt a little flustered, his gaze wandering, "Liu Guniang, may I tell you something else?"

Liu Guibao laughed, "No need to say it; you like me, what’s there to be afraid of? I like you too."

Huai Qian was left speechless.

After discussing trivial matters that wouldn’t trouble Liu Guibao too much, she began to consider the unfolding situation ahead.

Sometimes, a clever mind is indeed more useful than brute strength.

That young lord of North Ting was simply lacking in intellect and strength.

While Huai Qian was admiring the girl’s profile, he chuckled, leaning against the railing, looking into the distance.

What he wanted to say was to explain the concept of having fate without a share.

Because the two of them were too different; their backgrounds and statuses were mismatched, and they couldn’t really connect. Today, they were chatting only because he was accommodating her.

There was too much disparity between them, whether in cultivation or scheming; as for family background, it went without saying.

Thus, he had always felt a bit sorry for this naive girl.

As for the opportunities here, he should be the most aware of their magnitude.

It was that thread of sword energy.

That was what he had come for.

He had just been playing around along the way, teasing those around him.

However, that thread of sword energy was indeed an unexpected delight.

He had originally planned to make another trip north to see the great sword immortal Bai Chang before returning home.

If all went well, this top sword immortal of the north would likely come out to greet him.

The thought of home made Huai Qian feel increasingly bored.

Watching these ants dance like marionettes, swaying left and right, after half an hour, it became tiresome.

As for that behind-the-scenes figure, since they were being suppressed by that thread of sword energy, how high could their realm be?

Even if they didn’t reveal their background, he could still negotiate well with that figure. If he acquired that thread of sword energy, they would lose the long-standing suppression, a win-win situation.

He turned to glance at the foolish girl still furrowing her brow in thought.

Huai Qian leaned over the railing, turning to smile and ask, "Liu Guniang, do you want to become the sect leader of the Colorful Sparrow Sect today?"

Liu Guibao immediately staggered back, "Who exactly are you?!"

Huai Qian raised a finger, placing it over his lips, "Shhh."

He communicated through thought, "Before coming to North Julu, my ancestors warned me that the sword immortals here don’t play fair and particularly enjoy killing talents from other continents. So I must tread carefully."

Liu Guibao’s expression turned cold, her thoughts racing, yet she found herself unable to communicate with her master Sun Qing through resonance.

Huai Qian sighed, "Liu Guniang, if you continue like this, we won’t be able to become friends."

This young man, appearing scholarly, shook his sleeves and looked up at the sky, "I’m not going to waste time with you. These little tricks of white paper talismans are making me nauseous. I must teach this rural deity a lesson, as well as that old man Huan Yun, what true talismans are."

Suddenly, he had an item in each hand; one was a golden military armor talisman, the highest-ranked incense spirit armor. 

This armor was among the very few ancient artifacts within the incense talismans.

Huai Qian donned it behind him.

In the other hand, he had two green talismans, casually tossing one as he smiled, "Bind with iron nails and send to the underworld, summon the thunder god, control the thunder and lightning, and command the forces of heaven."

A towering, two-zhang-tall golden-armored deity appeared out of thin air, its body interwoven with dazzling white lightning. When it landed, the mountain trembled, stirring the energetic essence of the entire mountain.

After tossing the second talisman, a white-clad swordsman hovered in mid-air.

Though his expression was dull, he was suffused with raging sword energy that swirled around him, turning the surrounding spiritual energy into powder.

Finally, Huai Qian held a golden, hollow small sphere in his palm.

Inside, strands of sword light flew about, racing like wind, crashing into the small net and sparking with bursts of fire.

This journey to the sword-cultivating haven of North Julu aimed to rely on his own abilities to gather a few of the Golden Core swordsmen's life swords for this potential puppet attendant, hoping to gain some of North Julu’s swordway fortune to break through the Nascent Soul bottleneck.

Huai Qian gently shook the golden sphere in his palm, then tossed it to the middle-aged swordsman, "Take your time."

The sphere sank into the swordsman’s point of contact.

That strand of sword energy, which had patrolled this realm for countless years, came to a halt, seemingly gazing down at Huai Qian.

Huai Qian smiled, "I knew you would choose me."

Then he looked toward the heavens, "Such a unique demonic aura that enjoys transforming mountains into food—there’s no such creature in our Haoran world?"

The world fell silent.

Everyone was left dumbfounded.

Huai Qian narrowed his eyes, "Let’s make a deal: after the killing, if I can’t kill you, you won’t have any means against me. You can follow me back to the Central Divine Continent, and I guarantee a bright future for you."

The clouds hung low.

A tall old man sat at the edge of the cloud sea, smiling, "You’ve got quite the audacity, little brat."

With a wave of his hand, a mountain-and-water painting unfolded, covering the skies. Anyone who looked up could see it.

Since the other party was so sincere, this elder also planned to show some sincerity of his own.

Huai Qian nodded, smiling, "I can’t help it; my ancestor is one of the ten in the Central Divine Continent."

In reality, a certain young master from Longhu Mountain and a certain Liu Youzhou from Aihai Continent were very good friends of his.

The elder above the cloud sea fell silent.

Huai Qian continued, "To put it bluntly, even if I stick out my neck and let you do it, would you dare to kill me?"

Huai Qian emphasized the words, scoffing, "Would you dare?!"

The elder remained silent.

Huai Qian scanned the area, "Are these wasteful people going to be killed by you or me? If you’re going to take action, I’ll be taking a few with me."

In the depths of the mountain, Chen Ping’an was equally astonished by this scene.

After the water curtain disappeared, Chen Ping’an immediately transformed into a youthful visage, donned in a green shirt.

At this moment, he felt enlightened.

Can it really be this chaotic?

Looking at the spirited young man, could this be considered excitement?

Chen Ping’an chuckled.

If such a person were to experience the same circumstances as himself, no matter how much higher their realm, how many times would they have died by now?

However, one couldn’t put it this way.

With such words and actions, and standing here saying such things, they undoubtedly had their strengths and some hidden merits.

Yet at this moment, Chen Ping’an only saw one aspect of the other party.

If Chen Ping’an were in that person’s shoes, he certainly wouldn’t have reached the point that person had today.

Yet Chen Ping’an felt that, given the temperament of such a person, should misfortune befall them, they might not necessarily survive leaving North Julu.

Ultimately, it was just that they had yet to encounter the likes of the Sword Immortal Ji Yue from the Yan Tui Mountain.

However, since this person had chosen to reveal themselves, no longer hiding, it must be a result of weighing the pros and cons.

At present, it seemed not only would they likely survive, but they could also bring that tall elder along back to the Central Divine Continent.

Undeniably, they were quite a formidable character.

No wonder they had come to North Julu specifically to hunt sword cultivators.

Chen Ping’an was not so bored as to curse that person for stumbling in North Julu.

All paths lead to the mountain.

Looking left and right, there are bound to be highs and lows.

Just like Cao Ci, who had walked the same path as Chen Ping’an in martial arts; Chen Ping’an could only bury his head and chase after them.

Should he really be wishing misfortune upon the other?

Chen Ping’an rubbed his chin, feeling that this moment of deep thought was perhaps inappropriate, yet it seemed rather interesting.

Regarding Cao Ci, on the city wall of the Sword Qi Great Wall, after three rounds of fighting, Chen Ping’an’s only regret was not having put on a fierce front in front of Chen Laojian and that female Martial Divinity.

But rather, it was that Cao Ci always seemed to have that infuriating aura of ease, looking effortlessly handsome, and always calm, the only focus of his sight being the legendary pinnacle of martial arts.

This was genuinely vexing, especially since he couldn’t even defeat him temporarily, making it even more infuriating.

Slow and steady wins the race.

However, the next scene made Chen Ping’an feel chills run down his spine.

He saw the Sun Daoist, who had initially been frightened to the ground, suddenly stand up.

Then this "Sun Daoist" fell back to the ground.

However, a second, ethereal Sun Daoist appeared as if the spirit had left its body to travel far.

The Sun Daoist reached out, capturing the remaining sword energy that attempted to struggle and flee, controlling it in his hand, squeezing it gently.

The tall old man above the cloud sea sensed something was wrong; even though he had no idea why the Sun Daoist had transformed like this, he rolled the clouds, concealing his form and preparing to escape.

With a blank expression, Sun Daoist murmured, "You little demon, how dare you attempt to refine this mountain and try to lay hands on the Daoist temple?"

Sun Daoist glanced at the ruins, seemingly feeling a hint of sadness, looking towards a place in the distant cloud sea, "Do you think that with this Haoran world, you can be at ease? Bullying my lineage that is withering, unable to raise my sword?"

Sun Daoist clenched his palm, directly crushing that strand of sword energy.

Then he brought his fingers together and gently swiped forward.

The cloud sea parted in half.

A figure the size of a mustard seed was split in two.

Huai Qian was about to speak.

But Sun Daoist turned to smile, "What are you? You’re still young, yet you speak such big words? If you have your life lamp’s wick left in the Ancestor Hall, just tell your family’s ancestor to come find me in the Qingming world for revenge."

Huai Qian wanted to respond, wanting to report his family’s elder’s life.

But Sun Daoist again swiped with his fingers, slaying the young scholar on the spot, along with the Nascent Soul sword cultivator puppet, transforming them into two pieces of severed talismans as they hit the ground.

Finally, Sun Daoist looked down at the Daoist temple ruins.

The offering at the mountaintop was his junior disciple.

Both were the backbone of the sword immortals’ lineage in the Qingming world.

Unfortunately, the junior disciple, having been exceptionally talented, ascended quickly but also fell early.

He could not blame the White Jade Capital; he could only blame himself for being indecisive, which resulted in this elder brother being unable to avenge him.

In this world, there are countless ways to die, but seeking death oneself is the most unnecessary to save.

In the distance at the mountain peak, Chen Ping’an had already retrieved all the fragments of the wooden statue.

Sun Daoist smiled, "Little one, you still remain so clever, not wasting my moment of distraction, which counts as self-rescue."

Sun Daoist extended his hand, pulling out the concealed Di Yuanfeng, along with the young lord Zhan Qing and Liu Guibao, and brought them before him.

Sun Daoist’s expression was calm as he asked, "You three, are you willing to follow me to the Qingming world?"

He had accumulated enough merit during his travels in this realm to take three people with him.

As he awaited their responses, time seemed to freeze.

Only Sun Daoist stroked his beard, smiling at the young man in the distance, "Chen Daoyou, for the sake of those three incense sticks, you can keep the shattered wooden statue."

Chen Ping’an blinked, "Sun Daolong, it’s actually six sticks."

Sun Daoist burst into laughter, waving his sleeve as if he didn’t care about gathering or scattering items. "Chen Daoyou, just pick up your scraps. It’s enough to feed your sword."

Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away on another mountaintop, a tattered sword energy emerged in front of Chen Ping’an. 

(End of Chapter)

 # Chapter 645: Why Dare to Be Angry but Unable to Speak

After the flow of time had come to a standstill, the mountains loomed high, the waters ran deep, and the world was silent and still.

In the depths of the mountains, Master Huang was hiding on a cliff covered by ancient pines. He had chiseled out a narrow cave that barely accommodated himself and his large backpack. At this moment, he was drenched in sweat, frozen in the river of time. A group of four had ventured into the mountains seeking treasure, and Master Huang had always believed he could easily dispose of the other three. Little did he expect that he was the one who could easily be killed—a mere insignificant character.

The scruffy man named Jin Shan was hiding among the reeds by a lake, a talisman stuck to his chest, looking dazed.

Not far from this man were the two direct disciples of Shen Zhenze from Cloud City, holding hands, their veins bulging, revealing the inner turmoil of the couple at this moment.

Nearby, a certain Elder Xu, a venerated figure from Longmen, had a grim expression, his eyes somewhat vacant.

At the summit of the mountain, the old master Huan Yun had his eyes closed, exuding fatigue, seemingly lost in thought, unaware of where his mind had wandered.

The martial general Gao Ling, clad in a dew-soaked armor, clenched his fists tightly, his face contorted in pain.

Wu Qun’s gaze was blank, one hand pressed against his heart, likely stunned into shock by one unexpected event after another.

A myriad of emotions swept across the crowd.

After Huai Qian’s death, the golden statue deity and the Nascent Soul puppet that had stood in for him transformed from two green talismans into four. A golden hollow sphere containing numerous sword cultivators' life swords, which had previously rolled onto the ground, now quietly leaned against the railing, stained with blood.

The sword qi had been so fierce that Huai Qian’s soul, along with his Golden Core and Nascent Soul, had been instantly shattered. Even the two priceless items on his person had been destroyed in that moment, and all his treasured possessions had naturally dissipated, merging into the rich spiritual energy that filled the mountains and waters of this realm.

The stasis of time occasionally gave rise to waves of seven-colored glass-like ripples, akin to a small stone tossed into the river—though the disturbance was minimal, it still created tiny splashes.

Only the fragments of green glass tiles from the ruins of the Taoist temple at the mountain peak seemed to resonate with the stilled river of time, radiating the unique halo of the immortal's refined glass tiles.

Chen Ping’an had become accustomed to such circumstances; it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, as it could temper a martial artist's body.

He had once witnessed the old master of the East Sea Taoist Temple, over the span of three hundred years in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, occasionally picking up tiny golden fragments the size of rice grains.

However, Chen Ping’an did not reach out to catch that swirling sword qi.

“Are you afraid?” the Daoist Sun asked with a smile.

Chen Ping’an nodded, “I am indeed a bit afraid.”

Sun Daoist continued, “This is an opportunity that belongs to you. It has little to do with the ‘Daoist Sun’ you know. Just accept it without worry. In this world, those who do not seek death will never die. At least, that’s how it is from my perspective. As for those who seek death, they should blame their lack of a strong backing or their ancestor’s name not being terrifying enough.”

At this point, Sun Daoist cast a glance at the corpse.

A top figure from the Central Continent.

Could he compare to the top figures of the entire Qingming realm?

If challenged to arm-wrestle, even Sun Daoist would fear the small limbs of your ancestor, and he wouldn’t dare to engage.

However, Sun Daoist’s sword and true self had remained within that Taoist temple in the Qingming realm, and under the constraints of Confucian rules in the Haoran realm, Sun Daoist currently was far from reaching his peak form.

Only then did Chen Ping’an retrieve the Sword Nourishing Gourd, carefully storing that extraordinarily pure shattered sword qi within, causing the gourd to become exceedingly heavy.

Chen Ping’an smiled, “I dare not refuse the gifts from the Elder.”

Sun Daoist smiled in response, withdrawing his gaze. In an instant, Di Yuanfeng, Zhan Qing, and Liu Guibao regained their senses, finding themselves amidst the stagnant river of time. They felt slightly dizzy, especially Zhan Qing, who felt as if her insides had shattered, teetering on the brink of collapse, forcing herself to hold on and not fall.

Moreover, Sun Daoist had also restored Sun Qing and Bai Bi, both Golden Core cultivators, to their normal state.

Sun Daoist said, “I intend to take the three of you as registered disciples. However, I won’t force anyone; you can choose whether to change your allegiance. Remember, this opportunity only comes once, so ask your true heart.”

The young lord Zhan Qing from Beiting Country knelt immediately, kowtowing in gratitude, tears brimming in her eyes.

She didn’t even glance at Bai Jie.

Bai Bi appeared lost in thought; she could speak but remained silent, unsure whether to congratulate him or feel sorrow herself.

Di Yuanfeng, who had traversed the world with straw shoes and a bamboo staff, imitated the manners of the Taoist and bowed to this old immortal, his heart churning with mixed emotions.

After a moment, feeling that his respect wasn’t enough, he knelt on the ground and knocked his head three times, not daring to rise for a long time.

Prostrated on the ground, Di Yuanfeng felt as if he were dreaming.

First, he had been approached by that seemingly powerful old man in the cave’s study, who had actively offered to take him as the first disciple of the sect. Then that fellow had died, replaced by the current “Sun Daoist,” who claimed he wanted to take him as a disciple.

How much virtue had he accrued in his past life?

However, Sun Daoist did not divulge the secrets of Di Yuanfeng’s lineage connection; the timing for such revelations was better delayed than rushed.

His senior brother had walked the world with straw shoes and a bamboo staff.

But the Dao was hard to fathom; he had met with death and annihilation, having suffered a full-force strike from Bai Yujing’s second-ranked Daoist.

Throughout the Qingming realm, it was said that his senior brother had died a glorious death, as it was a rare occurrence for someone to force the second-ranked Daoist to take full action in three thousand years.

Sun Daoist did not wish to dwell on these seemingly flattering yet nonsensical words.

As for the demon willing to bestow a favor upon Di Yuanfeng, it stemmed from this; it wasn’t genuine gratitude for the offering to that Taoist temple but rather a desire to seek good fortune.

As for the girl Liu Guibao, she was no different from Zhan Qing; she was merely a temporary distraction devised by Sun Daoist. Nonetheless, for them, this was still a fateful connection, and it was not insignificant. Their future fortunes were merely a matter of the master leading them through the door; the onus of cultivation lay with the individual, and even Di Yuanfeng was no exception. In fact, the Peach Blossom Crossing in Cai Que Prefecture, where Liu Guibao was from, had a faint connection to Sun Daoist’s lineage, and even the smallest connection in the world still counted as a connection.

The Dao hearts of these three could be slowly sculpted. How they fared today, or even their cultivation level in this life, might long-term be akin to stepping stones on the path up the mountain.

Liu Guibao hesitated.

Sun Qing tried to convey to this disciple through her thoughts that the opportunity for the Great Dao was just within reach, and if she did not seize it now, she might regret it in the next moment!

However, Sun Qing suddenly flew backward, blood gushing from her seven orifices, her spirit shaken, and her soul tormented, causing her great pain.

Sun Daoist looked at Liu Guibao and shook his head, “Her aptitude is better than Zhan Qing’s, but unfortunately, her temperament is lacking, and the Dao does not align. Forget it.”

In an instant, the girl felt a void in her heart.

Unable to control herself, tears streamed down her face.

Yet she still gritted her teeth and remained silent, standing there without a word.

Sun Qing struggled to rise, wanting to persuade her disciple a few more times, wishing to tell that little fool that it was she, the lord of Cai Que Prefecture, who had expelled her from the ancestral hall, not her rebellion against the master.

Even if it was treason against the master, so what? In the realm of the Dao, such fortune, even if you reincarnated a hundred times, how could you encounter it again?

On the path of cultivation, many profound opportunities truly are unique in this life; once missed, they would be impossible to find again in countless lifetimes.

Sun Daoist glanced at the young Golden Core cultivator, slightly surprised, and smiled, “Your temperament is not bad, but your aptitude is too poor. With some luck, you might reach the Nascent Soul at best.”

Perhaps the words were harsh.

But they were the truth.

Sun Daoist said, “Then I will only take two of you. Di Yuanfeng and Zhan Qing, stand up; you won’t need to observe the formalities of master-disciple etiquette here.”

Sun Daoist contemplated for a moment and took the demon that had been severed in two into his hands at the mountain peak, “Like to pretend to be dead? I’ll send you on your way?”

The corpse combined back into one, kneeling on the ground, saying nothing, merely silent.

Sun Daoist sneered, “My junior brother, who once brought you along the cultivation path, while my lineage has always viewed grievances and enmities with indifference, you, as a beast, don’t even know to express a shred of gratitude; that’s a world apart.”

The great demon trembled uncontrollably.

Sun Daoist nodded, “I may not have been able to save my junior brother back then, but I can help him cut this fate.”

Manipulating human hearts? Is it amusing? Not even aware of one’s own heart, just kneading mud in a pile of muck, without fear of being laughed at.

Having been beside his junior brother for so many years, in the end, he had read so many texts from the Three Teachings and Hundred Schools in vain.

Only knowing the surface of “seeking the truth,” yet not understanding the essence of “be cautious.”

Sun Daoist placed his hand gently on the top of the great demon's head and gave it a light pat. The latter didn’t even have time to struggle before its primordial spirit was obliterated, without even a single cry of anguish. Instead, two items popped out and fell to the ground.

One was a broken book, and the other was a talisman-sized object.

Sun Daoist took a glance and then dismissed it, smiling, and waved a hand in a direction.

At the same time, the five people, including Di Yuanfeng, returned to the river of time, unaware.

In an instant, Chen Ping’an appeared as if he had performed the Mountains and Rivers Contracting Technique, standing at the mountain peak without any pretense or concealment; there was no need for it.

Sun Daoist was slightly surprised, “You’ve crossed the river of time quite a few times?”

Chen Ping’an honestly replied, “Not many times, but it hasn’t been short.”

Sun Daoist smiled, “Since you’ve seen the scenery from a higher place, you should cherish it. Don’t be like that Huai Qian, unaware of the heights of heaven and depths of the earth. Even ordinary commoners know to paste door gods for protection. This kid, however, wanted to paste ‘seeking death’ on his own forehead. The strand of sword qi left by someone had targeted Huai Qian, and I tolerated it, but seeing someone so determined to seek death, they will always get their wish.”

Chen Ping’an hesitated for a moment.

Sun Daoist said, “That Huang Master? He doesn’t seek death; he struggles to survive. In my eyes, your and Huang Master’s ways of living are similar, merely differing in paths. As for the differences in your paths, that is not for me to say; the path is not about height, but length.”

Chen Ping’an then had no small questions left to ask.

However, he had one big question he was eager to ask.

Sun Daoist continued, “You weigh the good and bad of human hearts and the karmic retribution of this world too heavily, yet still too shallowly, which is why your heart is so burdened. Many things, once done, are ultimately useless; heaven and earth are not lifeless—they will naturally correct human matters. However, when one reaches a sufficiently high realm, there may still be a slim chance to truly change some constants. Is it that thinking too much makes everything seem uninteresting? That’s right; life in this world, from the very first day, is not particularly interesting. But nowadays, very few people in the three realms are willing to remember this.”

Chen Ping’an’s expression darkened.

Sun Daoist jokingly said, “It seems your heart cultivation isn’t quite enough yet.”

Sun Daoist shook his sleeves, and many heavenly materials and earthly treasures, along with immortal artifacts, transformed into tiny particles that flew into his sleeves.

Even a portion of what Huan Yun and the old priest of Cloud City had stored in their talisman-sized items obediently left and headed into Sun Daoist’s sleeves.

Yet that “Sun Daoist” lying on the ground had turned to ashes.

This intentionally wasted outer body of the yang spirit was just a useless shell.

All the entanglements accumulated over the years in the Haoran realm had been attached to that shell.

He would not take it away.

The “treasure mountain” beside the ruined Taoist temple at the mountain peak was left with only a few scattered small bundles.

Then, in the next moment, everyone departed from the mountain peak, arriving at the open space beyond the White Jade Arch Bridge.

The green mountains and clear waters, along with the numerous mountain peaks that had been diligently refined by the great demon, were still entirely collected by Sun Daoist into his sleeves.

It was as if the heavens and earth had suddenly become vast and misty.

Sun Daoist slowly smiled, “Apart from the one opportunity you’ve already seized in the mountains, I will remain here, waiting for them to wake up. Whether they deserve to be punished or killed, whether it is sorrow or joy, everything will remain as it was.”

The corpse of Huai Qian, the green talisman, and the golden sphere were all nowhere to be found.

A volume of radiant Daoist scripture fluttered out, hovering in front of Liu Guibao, “Even if you cannot become master and disciple, I still want to gift you a tome.”

The Golden Core Sun Qing from Cai Que Prefecture also had a piece of fortune, that talisman-sized item.

Chen Ping’an hesitated to speak.

Sun Daoist glanced at the young man and smiled.

Sun Daoist seemed to see through human hearts, or perhaps he was prophetic, “Chen Daoist, with your dual identities of mountain dweller and package master, you ought to be thriving?”

Thus, the two bundles that Chen Ping’an had buried in the mountains fell at his feet.

Even someone like Chen Ping’an, who had a rather thick skin, felt a bit embarrassed, but that didn’t stop him from bending down to pick them up, slinging them over his shoulder.

After the belongings returned to their rightful owner, Chen Ping’an hurriedly said, “Thank you for your auspicious words, Daoist Sun!”

To hell with it; who knows if the old immortal from the Daoist sect has the ability to foretell? It’s best to agree first! There’s no loss; it’s a sure gain!

Sun Daoist found it amusing, laughing, “Cultivators, who in this world is more qualified to speak of the Dao than the Daoists? Young man, your Daoism is quite high; it’s worth taking a closer look.”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “I will.”

Sun Daoist stroked his beard and laughed, “Chen Daoist, do you wish to continue exploring the mountains and seeking opportunities?”

Chen Ping’an’s face turned somber, and he wiped his face vigorously, “For now, I have no such thoughts.”

This time it was Huai Qian who encountered Sun Daoist; who knows who Chen Ping’an might meet next time.

Sun Daoist said, “After I leave, there’s no need to overthink. Just do as you wish, whether as a wild cultivator or a package master; rely on your own abilities. Fortune and misfortune will come as they may.”

Chen Ping’an began to consider how to wrap things up.

Sun Daoist smiled at Chen Ping’an.

Chen Ping’an felt a bit dazed.

Sun Daoist teased lightly, repeating a phrase he had mentioned before, “Chen Daoist, your resolve in cultivation isn’t firm enough.”

Chen Ping’an immediately understood, blurting out, “Daoist, Daoist!”

The same character “Dao” was pronounced differently.

Sun Daoist stroked his beard and smiled, nodding gently in satisfaction, reminding him, “After half a stick of incense, the river of time will begin to flow again.”

Sun Daoist then drew Di Yuanfeng and Zhan Qing into his sleeves, transforming into a rainbow as he soared away.

Perhaps this was what they called the rise of chickens and dogs.

With a crash from the dazzling rainbow light, the entire celestial mansion’s canopy shattered, creating a large door. As the hole slowly expanded, the restrictions of mountains and waters gradually dissipated. However, after the white rainbow left the small realm, it vanished instantly, silent and unremarkable.

Chen Ping’an froze for a moment, retracting his gaze and beginning to sprint away.

Temporarily distancing himself from the land of turmoil.

As for the few packages containing treasures on the ground, Chen Ping’an didn’t spare them a glance, but once the dust settled, he could carefully consider them again.

Half a stick of incense later, Chen Ping’an had long since vanished without a trace.

The mountains returned to normal.

He just didn’t know where Huang Master and Jin Shan were.

However, Chen Ping’an on his way “coincidentally” ran to the Zaojing area, discovering that the spiritual energy remained abundant, but it was once again items that could be moved but not taken away.

Wait a moment.

It wasn’t the previous stone table or green bamboo.

Now that the restrictions of the small realm were gone, how could he not take it away? It just required a bit of effort.

Chen Ping’an then began to dig the earth, ultimately shouldering a gigantic zhao jing that resembled a huge grinding disk, dashing away while not forgetting to stick a talisman on his forehead.

Sticking it straight on his forehead inevitably obscured his vision; it would have been better to stick it horizontally.

He had learned this from his first disciple.

At the canopy of the Haoran realm, Sun Daoist looked back at the mountains and rivers of the mortal realm beneath him, clicking his tongue, “Not a blade of grass grows, not a blade of grass grows.”

An old Confucian scholar, with a golden jade badge hanging at his waist, said calmly, “The observer may leave now.”

Sun Daoist smiled, “Then please open the door and send me off.”

In the Northern Pavilion Kingdom’s mountains, Huan Yun, Sun Qing, and Bai Bi were the first to awaken, all momentarily bewildered, then straining to consolidate the spiritual energy of their vital gateways while carefully investigating the status of their life items.

However, Sun Qing immediately stored that talisman in her sleeve, seeing her disciple Liu Guibao still in a daze. She then also stowed away that volume of scripture for safekeeping.

Although they had no idea what had transpired, if Sun Qing didn’t dare to take the readily available items before her, what kind of cultivator would she be?

Huan Yun furrowed his brow tightly, “We should have already left that celestial mansion’s ruins.”

The old master was then shocked in his heart, wondering why the items in his talisman-sized object, once filled to the brim with heavenly materials and earthly treasures, now had barely a few left?

Liu Guibao discovered that the bastard named Huai Qian was actually missing.

What a good fellow, he had even deceived her all along. The girl clenched her teeth in anger.

Bai Bi noticed something was amiss, “Where’s Zhan Qing?”

But Liu Guibao’s good-natured temperament was plain to see; she was the first to notice the several packages on the ground and regarded them as opportunities to compete for.

However, Bai Bi also became aware of this, and Gao Ling, the Golden Body Realm warrior, had already regained his senses.

Liu Guibao and her master, Sun Qing, along with Bai Bi, quickly teamed up with Gao Ling, each snatching a heavy package filled with treasures from the celestial mansion.

As they all seized treasures, both sides had their own concerns, so they refrained from interfering with each other.

As for the other package, it was simultaneously eyed by the wild cultivator and the martial arts master standing side by side; in the end, both managed to grasp it, tearing apart the cotton bag, causing numerous treasures to clatter to the ground—over ten in total. The two of them picked up three or four items each, while the rest were commandeered by Huan Yun, Sun Qing, and Bai Bi, showcasing a highly coordinated division of spoils.

If it were a wild cultivator, the first thought would likely be to harm others for treasure, seeking fortune in danger, striving to gain the most advantage.

The remaining survivors who had miraculously avoided death scattered in fear.

In such a cursed place, staying even a moment longer would chill one to the bone.

Huan Yun’s expression shifted slightly; he sensed something amiss and quickly took flight, his sleeves filled with talismans rapidly sweeping out to search the surroundings, also ensuring the safety of Shen Zhenze’s two direct disciples. If that Elder Xu from Longmen discovered the sudden disappearance of the restrictions, he would undoubtedly flee with that talisman-sized item, likely never to return to the Lotus Flower Kingdom or Cloud City before reaching the Golden Core realm.

Fortunately, a dozen miles away, that young couple of cultivators remained safe and sound.

At the same time, one of the talismans, already hundreds of miles away, was shattered.

The old master sneered.

Finally intercepting the Cloud City venerator, the latter, in a fit of rage, shouted, “Huan Yun, are you really going to kill me to the last man?!”

Huan Yun replied, “Return to Cloud City with me and accept your fate under your city lord Shen Zhenze.”

The old venerator raised his hand, gripping that talisman-sized item tightly, “Do you believe I’ll shatter this item directly?”

Huan Yun calmly replied, “The treasures within are not insignificant. If this talisman-sized item shatters, it won’t destroy that immortal metamorphosis and robe either. But I advise you, if you really do that, I will let you die right here, and I will go and apologize to Shen Zhenze alone.”

The old venerator’s expression flickered between anger and uncertainty, “Huan Yun, I will absolutely not go to Cloud City with you. I know Shen Zhenze’s character very well; falling into his hands would be worse than death.”

Huan Yun exclaimed, “If I had known this earlier, I wouldn’t have acted so foolishly! If you hadn’t coveted the treasures in the mountains, bullying two juniors of low cultivation and treating them as puppets, you could have been a hero in Cloud City by now!”

The old venerator replied, “I can hand over the talisman-sized item to you, Huan Yun, but you must take out all the Shrink Earth Talismans as exchange. Lastly, I have one more small request: when you see those two youngsters, tell them that you’ve killed me.”

“Deal!” 

Huan Yun immediately took out a stack of Shrink Earth Talismans without hesitation, slightly spreading them out. Without exception, they were all Shrink Earth talismans. Among them were also two golden talismans.

Huan Yun said solemnly, “A fair trade. Xu, if you dare to play tricks, don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

At the same time, both threw the talismans and the white jade brush tube, and upon the Longmen venerator catching the talisman, he directly activated one of the golden talismans, instantly retreating over a hundred miles away.

Huan Yun sighed, turning back to find those two young individuals, handing over the white jade brush tube, according to his agreement with the Longmen venerator, saying, “Xu has died.”

The young man carefully accepted the white jade brush tube, feeling as if it weighed a thousand pounds, his fingers trembling. Only after storing it in his sleeve did he bow deeply to the old master, tears streaming down his face as he said, “Elder’s great life-saving grace, great protection of the Dao, great treasure-seizing grace; I have no way to repay!”

The young woman was even more distraught, holding her face in her hands, indeed validating the old saying that one who escapes great calamity will surely have future blessings, making her unable to control her emotions.

The harrowing experience of seeking treasures in the mountains would haunt her with nightmares for a lifetime.

Huan Yun smiled and said, “You two are relatively far from others. Take this opportunity to leave quickly. After returning to Cloud City, do not speak of this matter.”

Of course, Huan Yun wanted to roam a bit more and see if there were any missed opportunities.

After the young couple from Cloud City left, Huan Yun felt as if something was amiss, something he hadn’t noticed yet.

The venerator from Cloud City must have forced the secret method of the talisman-sized item from them, which was not surprising. However, Huan Yun was certain that the other party could not have extracted the immortal metamorphosis from the talisman-sized item and hidden it somewhere, nor could he have rolled up that robe to conceal it on himself. Huan Yun had enough discernment for this. Thus, that old venerator’s visit to the mountains had resulted in a net loss; he had only obtained a stack of talismans while losing his position as the chief venerator of Cloud City.

Huan Yun suddenly sighed, chuckling bitterly.

The old master had finally realized one thing.

Understanding why that young man had exhibited a trace of abnormality.

He, Huan Yun, had inexplicably lost the vast majority of heavenly materials and earthly treasures, as well as mountain artifacts within his own talisman-sized item. What then was the scene with the white jade brush tube?

If the immortal metamorphosis and that robe were both gone?

Or if one were left?

What would Shen Zhenze think?

Huan Yun felt somewhat emotional; that young cultivator was truly a good seedling.

What a pity.

He had been killed by that Xu venerator.

Huan Yun, failing to protect the Dao, could only return to Cloud City with that talisman-sized item.

Huan Yun’s gaze turned cold as he pursued.

The old master began to hope that there was still a treasured item left inside.

If not, he would send back the white jade brush tube to Cloud City. If there really was one, then it would be his own opportunity.

Bai Bi, Gao Ling, and the royal venerator from the Lotus Flower Kingdom left together.

All of them felt a heavy mood.

The young lord from Beiting and his family’s venerator had lost everything, with some dead and others surviving.

It was hard to explain.

The Beiting lord’s residence had a tough explanation to make, Zhan Qing’s Nascent Soul master had a tough explanation, and the Water Dragon Sect’s ancestral hall also faced difficulty in explaining.

Bai Bi could only pin her hopes on those treasures to make up for it.

Gao Ling said, “Those two can be killed.”

Bai Bi smiled, “That is indeed so. The opportunities on them will be equally divided between you two.”

Gao Ling, using his martial skills to gather sound into a line, asked the Golden Core disciple from the Water Dragon Sect, “The emperor will ask many questions about this. Afterward, Bai Xianshi’s sect may need to think a lot.”

Bai Bi replied, “Then let’s kill one more.”

Gao Ling said no more.

Bai Bi then said, “Gao Ling, I guarantee you can be the top martial general of the Lotus Flower Kingdom.”

Gao Ling hesitated for a moment before suddenly saying, “I want to change to a chair that a Qi Practitioner cannot sit on but a martial artist can. Once I sit on it, I may not only take the Lotus Flower Kingdom but also the Water Mist Kingdom and Northern Pavilion Kingdom, and Bai Xianshi can take whatever she wants.”

Bai Bi laughed and agreed, “Your ambition is not small, but I believe Gao Ling can sit steadily on that chair.”

The next moment, the venerator from the Lotus Flower Kingdom was killed by Gao Ling with a single punch, his head rolling away, while Bai Bi remained calm, immediately using techniques to destroy the corpse and erase all traces.

There was no need for verbal communication.

Cai Que Prefecture seemed to have become the biggest winner, or at least one of them.

Three came, and three left, all intact, and none could be said to have suffered injury.

They had not acquired a small number of treasures and opportunities.

Wu Qun suddenly spoke, “The black-robed elder who has been on the painting list first twice—will he come looking for trouble with our Cai Que Prefecture?”

The robe on the other party had allowed Wu Qun to recognize his identity.

Sun Qing smiled, “A person who can be friends with Liu Jinglong is not likely to be that despicable.”

Wu Qun still had some worries.

Earlier, Sun Qing had roughly confirmed the quality of that scripture and the talisman; she only said that the latter was a treasured item that only ordinary Fifth Realm cultivators could possess.

After this disaster, apart from Sun Qing and Liu Guibao, Wu Qun no longer trusted any outsiders.

After all, Wu Qun harbored a thought deep in her heart, a thought that frightened her. When Wu Qun asked herself, if she had the means and cultivation of that young sword immortal, could her fellow cultivators, Sun Qing and Liu Guibao, who had enviable cultivation aptitude and Dao fortune, still return to Cai Que Prefecture alive?

Wu Qun did not know the answer.

She did not dare to think further.

Meanwhile, Chen Ping’an, in a secluded mountain, hid the zhao jing at the bottom of a deep pool.

Changing into a new set of clothes, he took off all his robes and donned a simple blue shirt. The young man’s face was now carrying a large bamboo box containing four packages.

Then, as he walked out for over ten miles, he discovered that standing on a high branch beside the mountain path was that familiar old acquaintance, the Golden Body Realm martial artist, Huang Master.

Huang Master smiled, “I knew it was you.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Why not hide far away?”

Huang Master laughed, “It’s quite funny; even I can’t understand it myself. After leaving that strange place alive, I feel more at ease being near you, Brother Chen.”

Huang Master had completely lost his confidence in how he viewed others' cultivation levels and depth of Dao. The only thing he felt somewhat confident about was judging people’s characters.

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “Don’t provoke me. Let’s each go our own way; we should cherish our fortunes.”

Huang Master shook his conspicuously large backpack, “You’re an expert, Brother Chen. With so many distractions, I’m far behind. After this, Bai Bi and Gao Ling might come looking for me. If they slander me further, with so many items on my back, I might not even be able to leave the Northern Pavilion Kingdom.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Earlier, I heard you wanted revenge. What for?”

Huang Master’s expression was indifferent as he replied, “In my younger days, I acted impulsively, and I was at fault. However, I never expected that I’d survive, but my entire family of over forty—elders, women, and children—were skinned by cultivators and then dressed in human skins to wear on the dead.”

This purely martial artist spoke calmly, as if simply recounting a story read in a book.

The true suffering in the world is borne by those who endure it; they do not display the heart-wrenching cries seen by others. Even if they do, often after one or two occurrences, they will become even more silent.

Chen Ping’an remained silent.

Huang Master tugged at the corner of his mouth, “Regardless of who you are, I still somewhat trust you. Or rather, I feel lucky and want to take a big gamble. I’m willing to sell you most of the items in my backpack. I only accept immortal money. Once I gather enough, I’ll buy a military armor pill—not the divine person’s armor but a set of Jinwu weaving armor—and then buy the law knife I’ve had my eyes on for a long time. Then I can go do what I should do.”

Chen Ping’an took out a few talismans from his sleeve and tossed them to Huang Master, “These talismans are best for concealing one’s figure and energy. You’re a Golden Body Realm martial artist; you can conceal your traces even better. As long as you hide during the day and move at night, being cautious should be enough for you to leave the Northern Pavilion Kingdom unnoticed.”

Huang Master was momentarily stunned, not immediately reaching for the talismans. Back in the back mountain of the celestial mansion’s ruins, he had used the same method to beat the opponent until they spat blood.

However, at that time, it was more of a test of the other’s depth.

When those talismans drifted far away, Huang Master finally commanded them to his hand, remaining silent for a moment before asking, “What are you really after?”

Chen Ping’an had already continued on his way, leaving behind a sentence: “When calamity strikes, we dare to be angry but can’t speak.”

Just a simple phrase from an outsider.

Yet Huang Master, with a heart of iron and stone and a ruthless demeanor, found his lips trembling, his fists clenched. After loosening one fist and taking a deep breath, he wiped his face.

Suddenly, Huang Master shouted loudly, “Hey, Brother Chen, please stop.”

Chen Ping’an turned around and cursed, “I also have few precious talismans left! I’m just a package master who wakes up early and works hard for a living. I’m not a benevolent child of fortune. Damn it, don’t push your luck. You’re so ungrateful; the old accounts from the mountain haven’t even been settled yet. One punch weighing ten thousand pounds almost broke my old bones… my little bones nearly fell apart…”

Huang Master’s mouth twitched as he nearly wanted to take it back. He suddenly laughed, opening his backpack and shaking it vigorously. In the end, he tossed over three items in succession, “I, Huang Master, can’t be considered a good person, but I don’t wish to owe anyone a favor.”

The “youth” immediately changed his expression, cheerfully receiving the three items and placing them into the bamboo box.

Chen Ping’an rubbed his chin, wondering if they could sit down, share a drink, and slowly discuss business.

Huang Master laughed, “With these talismans, what else would I sell to you? With your business acumen, could I avoid losing money?”

Chen Ping’an laughed, “Too kind, too kind.”

The two parted ways.

Huang Master suddenly asked, “What’s your name? Can you tell me?”

That person did not turn around but raised an arm, lightly clenched his fist, “My name hasn’t changed; Chen Haoren.”

Huang Master couldn’t be bothered to reply.

To hell with your name, Chen Haoren.

But truly, he was a good person.

That person suddenly turned, his sleeves lightly shaking, and in his hand appeared two thick stacks of talismans. He said seriously, “Actually, I still have some offensive talismans here. To be honest, each one is a treasure, and they’re quite affordable…”

Huang Master had already stuck that talisman on himself, not waiting for the man to finish, and raised a middle finger at him, then kicked off the ground, flying away.

Chen Ping’an lamented, “Everyone is so clever; business is hard to do.”

Chen Ping’an walked alone through the lofty mountains, suddenly looking up. A man and a woman were desperately flying away with wind, then they suddenly darted like arrows into a forest, disappearing without a trace.

It was Shen Zhenze’s two direct disciples from Cloud City.

The young man was cautious, leading the girl to alter their route.

The aim was to avoid that potential calamity.

After receiving the talisman-sized item from the old master, they had left with the wind together. But upon immersing themselves in its contents, they discovered not only a few unfamiliar immortal artifacts but also that Elder Xu had treated the talisman-sized item as his own treasure, seeking opportunities that this malicious elder had found for himself. However, the most crucial items—the immortal metamorphosis and that robe—were both missing.

Huan Yun had said that Xu was dead.

Had he forced the secret method of the talisman-sized item from Xu? 

Why did Huan Yun need to go through such lengths? Did he also want to return the white jade brush tube to himself? Was he confident that he wouldn’t dare to leak any secrets to his master?

With such suspicions, one would begin to doubt everything.

And what about the old master Huan Yun? 

In fact, both were clever good people. During this visit to the mountains, even though Huan Yun had had some thoughts, in the end, he did not commit any acts that betrayed his conscience.

Yet ultimately, the trajectory of human hearts spiraled downward, turning from bad to worse.

Huan Yun transformed into a rainbow and pursued, gracefully descending, fixing his gaze upon the two young juniors, his expression indifferent as he asked, “What is the opening incantation of the talisman-sized item?”

The young man pulled the girl behind him and said, “Why does the old master ask when he already knows?”

Huan Yun shouted angrily, “If that were the case, why would I bother to be so redundant?”

The young man smiled bitterly, “How could I guess the intentions of such high beings and immortals?”

Huan Yun then recounted the events.

The young man was slightly startled, saying bitterly, “If that’s the case, why does the old master want to ask about the opening method of the talisman-sized item?”

Huan Yun replied, “So that you both die clearly.”

The young man asked, “We can abandon Cloud City and follow the old master to cultivate.”

Huan Yun looked expressionlessly at the young man behind him, “You must prove yourself.”

The young man suddenly burst into laughter, spitting in disdain, “You’re even worse than those wild cultivators, old master!”

Behind him, the girl felt a chilling sensation as a small concealed blade plunged into the young man’s back. He staggered forward a step, slowly turning his head, confusion written all over his face.

The girl had already retreated ten steps, trembling all over.

Yet she didn’t understand why she was clutching her wrist as if she had been injured.

Huan Yun smiled, “Very good.”

The already gravely injured man turned his head, gazing at the pale-faced girl, his eyes filled with guilt. Tears streamed down his face, but there was no anger, only disappointment and heartbreak as he gently spoke, “Are you foolish? We are all going to die.”

Huan Yun sneered, “Or perhaps you are the clever one.”

Huan Yun turned his head, “Since you are willing to save people, why hide and be sneaky?”

Chen Ping’an stepped out from behind a tree, casting a glance at the girl, whose gaze was filled with regret yet tinged with harshness.

It was just in time; the young man hadn’t died.

Chen Ping’an looked at the old master, “What a sight to behold in broad daylight.” 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 646: The Swordsman's Dilemma (Part One)

A venerable elder of the Runes Sect, with an ethereal presence.  
Xu Xingjiu from Cloud City was wounded.  
Zhao Qingwan, who had tried and failed to strike a blow.  
And an utterly superfluous young man dressed in a green robe, carrying a large bamboo box on his back.

Huan Yun said, “Why can't the shopkeeper just mind his own business? Why wade into this murky water? Strike while the iron is hot, take the profits, and leave. Earning money safely is the right path.”

Wuqian could identify Huan Yun by his black robe; naturally, he recognized him even more clearly. It wasn't that Chen Pingan was careless; rather, the means of that great demon from Lian Mountain were too unexpected, forcing the White-Clad Goddess and the Green-Clad Deity to unfurl a landscape painting, laying bare everything to those seeking treasures in the mountains.

Still, Huan Yun only speculated on the identity of the young man before him, guessing he was that rogue from Cloud City who sold charms and had the audacity to intervene. Among all the treasure seekers in the mountains, it seemed the only one with the guts and ability to act was that eccentric old man in the black robe.

Once cultivators on the mountain formed their own guesses, whether they were the truth or not became less important.

Chen Pingan chuckled, “Mountain and wild rogues, day in and day out, busy crossing mountains and rivers, sipping clear springs, wading through murky waters—what's so strange about that?”

Xu Xingjiu suddenly spoke, “Huan Zhenren, there's still room for negotiation in this matter.”

Huan Yun shook his head. “The moment I chose to hunt you down, there was no turning back. Xu Xingjiu, you're clever. Smart people shouldn’t say foolish things on purpose.”

Xu Xingjiu understood this well. If Huan Yun truly intended to be aboveboard and had no selfish desires, he wouldn't have chased after him and Zhao Qingwan.

The greater the desire, the narrower the heart, until there’s only a narrow path to tread, forcing one to walk alone.

In fairness, Xu Xingjiu recognized that his earlier choices were also flawed. At the moment Huan Yun handed over the white jade brush tube, he shouldn't have assumed the worst of Huan Yun. Upon learning that the treasures within the square inch had vanished without a trace, he should have chosen to be honest instead of hiding things. If Huan Yun had explained the complexities then, perhaps they wouldn't be in this predicament now. 

However, the ways of the world and the hearts of people were far from simple and clear-cut. The malicious schemes of Xu Gongfu, which ensnared them, made Xu Xingjiu not only feel trepidation but also realize that Huan Yun, as their protector, choosing to stand by and watch was a hidden menace, a concealed intent to kill. Perhaps Xu Gongfu intended to kill them for their treasures, allowing Huan Yun to lay in wait like a yellow sparrow afterward, with his hands completely clean.

Huan Yun did not rush to strike first.  
Chen Pingan also remained composed.  
Many things and people think they have no way back, yet there often is.

Huan Yun was actually in a most awkward position. Xu Xingjiu and Zhao Qingwan from Cloud City undoubtedly needed to be dealt with, but how to negotiate with this rogue who liked to change his identity was fraught with danger, as Huan Yun was uncertain about the other's cultivation level. He couldn’t even determine whether the person was a rune practitioner or the most troublesome sword cultivator on the mountain. Once determined, it would only mean either Huan Yun's death or the other’s demise, in which case all the opportunities and treasures would be his, and Huan Yun would gain profound fortunes.

Chen Pingan suddenly said, “If I'm not mistaken, you Daoists have always spoken about cultivating life without refining one's nature. This is the first ailment of cultivation.”

Huan Yun chuckled lightly. “Easier said than done.”

Chen Pingan replied, “Exactly because it’s so easy to say, it’s hard to do. If done, it becomes a hidden treasure, and virtue is embodied.”

Cultivating both life and nature, achieving great success, is akin to the seamless pagoda revered by Daoists and the fruit of non-leakage honored in Buddhism.

Huan Yun shook his head. “I know you're not very old and definitely not from the Dao sect, so don’t try to match wits with me by quoting those clichés. Why don’t we speak practically, just like we did back at the market in Cloud City?”

Chen Pingan shook his head as well. “As long as you still want to kill two people, we can’t conduct this transaction. Now that we've laid everything bare, aside from your greed and intent to kill, has Xu Xingjiu’s treasure inside that square inch truly compared to the heart you've labored your whole life to cultivate?”

Huan Yun was momentarily speechless, letting out a sigh. “What, you want to persuade me to back off just by talking?”

Xu Xingjiu interjected, “Huan Zhenren, I’m willing to take out all the treasures from that square inch as a price for my life. I sincerely ask you to select one after consideration, to leave behind something to report back to my master. Moreover, I can take an oath using the ancestral hall's secret methods, swearing that I, Xu Xingjiu, will never mention what you have done. In the future, you will still be a guest of honor in Cloud City, and if possible, we can even make you an honorary guardian of our Cloud City.”

Xu Xingjiu had already drawn out the dagger, still a token of their bond, wiped off the blood, and tucked it away, casually bandaging his wounds and swallowing a precious pill he carried from Cloud City.

The wound was not on his back but rather in his heart.  
But Xu Xingjiu was unbothered by it.  

Chen Pingan sighed.  
The smarter Xu Xingjiu acted, the more he assessed the situation and understood the greater picture; in Huan Yun’s eyes, he would only appear as a larger potential threat.  
There was no way around it.  
So, he would change his approach, adopting a style more akin to Beiju Luzhou.  
Otherwise, Huan Yun would resort to killing, risking everything for a big win.

Two flying swords, not yet fully refined into personal artifacts, shot out from two key energy centers, hovering to Chen Pingan's left and right—a slender white rainbow and a deep green glow.

Chen Pingan asked, “Huan Yun, do you want to make another mistake?”

Huan Yun’s sleeves billowed as countless talismans floated out, forming a protective formation around him, tremblingly saying, “Is it you, together with Liu Jinglong, who offered swords at the Festival of Lotus in the Fuhua Kingdom?!”

Chen Pingan inquired, “What do you think?”

Huan Yun sighed deeply. “No wonder, no wonder.”

Chen Pingan turned to Xu Xingjiu. “What do you say?”

Xu Xingjiu replied, “Senior, I will take my junior sister back to Cloud City.”

Zhao Qingwan cried out, “I won’t go! Xu Xingjiu, just kill me!”

Xu Xingjiu smiled bitterly. “Let’s not do anything foolish. There’s no hurdle we can’t overcome. Qingwan, if you trust me, just leave this place with me. We were the way we were before, and we can be the same in the future. I have no grudges here; you just need to clear your own heart, and nothing will have changed—perhaps it can even be better. Qingwan, everyone makes mistakes; don’t be afraid, we can correct our wrongs.”

Zhao Qingwan, like a person possessed, turned pale, but her eyes were red. “We can’t go back, it’s already too late. You either kill me or I kill you; otherwise, let’s die together. In our next life, we can be a couple, ensuring we’ll love each other forever. Xu Xingjiu, how about that?”

Xu Xingjiu’s expression turned serious, drawing the dagger and gently tossing it to Zhao Qingwan. He looked around, surrounded by dense forest, and self-mockingly said, “Husband and wife are like birds of the same forest; when disaster strikes, they fly separate ways. Yet, we haven’t even become partners yet, and it’s already come to this. Qingwan, give me another stab. Otherwise, even if I have to tie you up, I’ll take you back to Cloud City. I promised to become your partner in this lifetime; I, Xu Xingjiu, will keep my word.”

Zhao Qingwan held the dagger, staring blankly at Xu Xingjiu. Suddenly, she smiled, tears in her eyes, her lips moved silently, seemingly saying three words.

Xu Xingjiu’s eyes brimmed with tears.  
It had always been this way; he adored her expressive eyes.

Years ago, when the master brought a little girl to Cloud City, the boy looked at her as she tilted her head, her round eyes wide open.  
The boy made a face.  
The little girl was so frightened that she began to cry.

Year after year, Cloud Sea high above held people’s homes.  
Zhao Qingwan suddenly thrust the dagger towards her heart.  

In the next moment, Xu Xingjiu was in front of her, gripping the dagger with his hand, blood spurting.  
Xu Xingjiu softly said, “Qingwan, we’ve both died once; can we start anew in this lifetime?”

Zhao Qingwan let go of her grip, squatting down, cradling her face in her hands.  
Xu Xingjiu dropped the dagger, crouched down, and gently embraced her. Just as he was about to pat her back soothingly, he remembered his palm was covered in blood; he gently turned his hand over and stroked with the back of his hand, whispering, “Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid. You always resented me for not saying I liked you, right? In the future, don’t ask again. What man often speaks of his true feelings?”

Huan Yun's expression was complex.  
Chen Pingan asked, “Huan Yun, you seem to have left a child back in Cloud City?”

Huan Yun flew into a rage. “Never harm the family!”

Chen Pingan said, “I intend to learn from you; I will sever the roots of this trouble.”

Huan Yun questioned, “Are you forcing me to perish with you?”

Chen Pingan replied, “Do you think you’re worth it?”

Huan Yun appeared as if he aged a hundred years in an instant, his weariness evident. “Enough. A lifetime of reputation ruined in an instant. From now on, I will never set foot in Cloud City again. Regardless of how Xu Xingjiu and Shen Zhenze target me, it is all a result of my own actions.”

Chen Pingan shook his head. “Whether you see me as a good person or a bad one is irrelevant, but I advise you not to treat me as a fool.”

Huan Yun gritted his teeth. “What do you want?! You really want to kill me, Huan Yun, and then kill my grandson? I refuse to believe you can do it…”

Chen Pingan interrupted Huan Yun’s words and slowly said, “I’ll accompany you on this soul-searching journey.”

Huan Yun was taken aback.  
Chen Pingan added, “Do you have a talisman boat? We should best travel back to Cloud City together.”

In the end, two valuable talisman boats, as large as mundane ferries, slowly ascended, heading towards Cloud City.  
One carried four people; the other bore a massive treasure pulled from a deep pool, both boats protected by Huan Yun’s illusionary talismans.

On one end of the boat sat Xu Xingjiu and Zhao Qingwan side by side.  
Chen Pingan and Huan Yun sat back to back against the ship's wall.

Chen Pingan sat cross-legged, leaning against the large bamboo box, and turned to speak to the girl: “Cherish this hard-earned good fortune. In the future, as you both interact, you must not take this incident lightly, nor should you deliberately avoid today’s turmoil. Otherwise, it will lead to trouble sooner or later, and it would be sadder to die late than to die early. If both of you can pass this heart hurdle, you and Xu Xingjiu will truly become celestial partners. The path of cultivation is fraught with trials; self-examination is the hardest. This may be the tribulation you both need to refine your hearts; whether you can turn misfortune into fortune depends on whether you are willing to consider the gains and losses therein.”

Then Chen Pingan turned to Xu Xingjiu and said, “Even if you truly don’t mind this, on her side, a mistake is still a mistake, and a grave mistake is a grave mistake. So don’t comfort her with empty words. You, Xu Xingjiu, must clarify this for yourself; otherwise, it will only make her feel more guilty and self-conscious, feeling unworthy of you. In the end, you may either turn against each other or become strangers. Ultimately, it’s still your fault for not being good enough. There’s no way around it; since you, Xu Xingjiu, have chosen to be the good person, you must pay the price for it.”

Xu Xingjiu held Zhao Qingwan's hand and nodded with a smile.  
In the realm of their hearts, it felt like they had found light among the shadows, the rain clearing to reveal a bright sky, and they sensed they were on the brink of breaking through a bottleneck.

After hearing Chen Pingan’s words, Zhao Qingwan seemed to unlock some of the knots in her heart, slightly loosening the still unresolved ones.  
Though they seemed to be holding hands, she had always been the one held by Xu Xingjiu. Now, she finally grasped Xu Xingjiu’s hand, tightening her grip slightly.

Huan Yun remained silent, eyes closed in contemplation.  
Since Chen Pingan had made clear his identity as the “Sword Immortal” who had ascended with Qi Jinglong, he no longer hid it, removing the facade of youth and restoring his true appearance, donning the black robe of the hundred-eyed Tuo Tuo, now brimming with spiritual energy, which Chen Pingan could use for refining.

As for whether Huan Yun would think there was an opportunity to exploit, that would depend on this elder’s luck.  
In this world, when villains harbor malicious thoughts and act wickedly, once they suffer losses, should they still blame others for not marking them as “experts?”

Then Xu Xingjiu formulated a strategy that would neither betray his master Shen Zhenze nor harm Cloud City’s interests, while also preserving Huan Yun’s reputation.  
Even Xu Xingjiu’s injuries had a reasonable yet unexpected explanation.  
Seamless. Logical.

Chen Pingan had no objections.  
Though Huan Yun still kept his eyes shut, he nodded gently.  
The two talisman boats directly entered Cloud City, where Shen Zhenze personally awaited them.

Xu Xingjiu recounted the “sequence of events”—the malicious plot of Xu Gongfu and the timely protection offered by the elder Huan Yun.  
Then, they encountered this fellow practitioner, the senior who had sold charms at their market, and together they overcame difficulties in the heavily fortified ruins of the immortal palace.

Shen Zhenze was taken aback, surprised by the myriad dangers faced.  
As for how they managed to escape, not only Xu Xingjiu but even Huan Yun remained in the dark. Thus, Shen Zhenze increasingly felt that his two disciples had indeed been immensely blessed on this trip down the mountain, as they returned safely, not only alive but also bringing back several treasures from the white jade brush tube, which was no small feat. Without a second thought, Shen Zhenze divided the four treasures from the square inch among the four: Huan Yun, the elder Chen, Xu Xingjiu, and Zhao Qingwan, each receiving one.

Huan Yun could not refuse and had to choose first, selecting the least valuable and lowest-ranked item.  
Chen Pingan, unabashed, directly picked the most appealing one: a pair of couplets with golden bats on a blue background.

“The wind and rain beyond the mountain, three-foot sword;  
When there’s business, draw the sword and descend the mountain.  
In the clouds, flowers, and birds, a room full of books;  
Without worries, reading brings forth sages.”

Xu Xingjiu let Zhao Qingwan choose first. Zhao Qingwan’s gaze was filled with resentment, but Xu Xingjiu recalled the teachings of that sword immortal and no longer hesitated, selecting one himself.

Due to the serious nature of the situation, involving the defection of a chief offering from Cloud City, the celebration feast attended by only five people quickly dispersed.  
Shen Zhenze, of course, wanted to discuss this matter with Xu Xingjiu repeatedly. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust his most valued disciple, but he worried there were critical aspects Xu Xingjiu hadn’t considered, so as a master, he had to help remedy one or two things.

To be honest, many times Shen Zhenze felt that he, the city lord of the Golden Core, was unworthy of having Xu Xingjiu as his disciple.  
However, such grand truths could not be spoken aloud and could only be kept in his heart.

In the secret chamber of Shen Zhenze’s place of cultivation, Zhao Qingwan sat quietly beside her senior brother Xu Xingjiu as usual, watching him converse with their master.  
Yet, thinking of how her most respected master, Xu Xingjiu, had so earnestly deceived him today—though there was not an ounce of malice behind it—was a refreshing event she had never dared to imagine before. Zhao Qingwan couldn’t help but smile, bowing her head to hide her slight amusement, but as she laughed, tears quietly rolled down her cheeks.

Shen Zhenze noticed her unusual behavior and gently asked, “Qingwan, what’s wrong?”

Zhao Qingwan became flustered, at a loss for words.  
Xu Xingjiu chuckled, “Master, before we descended the mountain, Qingwan kept saying she was a burden. But back then, she said it jokingly to me. Looking back, oh? It turns out it really is so. So on the way here, I’ve been crying and laughing, so please don’t mind her. I’ll scold her a bit later for not cultivating her heart enough, but after the scolding…”

Xu Xingjiu laughed too.  
Shen Zhenze asked in confusion, “What is it?”

Xu Xingjiu stood up, performed a respectful bow, and solemnly said, “I humbly request my master to agree to my union with Qingwan as partners.”

Shen Zhenze laughed heartily, “Does it matter if I don’t agree? You two don’t even agree!”

Zhao Qingwan lifted her head, emotions mixed, and fell to the ground, weeping loudly.  
Shen Zhenze looked at Xu Xingjiu, his expression serious.  
Xu Xingjiu shook his head, his gaze clear.  
Shen Zhenze chose not to press further.

Any Golden Core cultivator in the world, regardless of their actual realm, may have high or low cultivation but possess a mind that ordinary people cannot match.  
While it’s rare for a Golden Core to slay a Nascent Soul, it’s not uncommon for them to scheme against one.  
Not just Golden Cores, but all cultivators face this.

On the path of cultivation, how can one be careless?  
Chen Pingan temporarily resided in a mansion in Cloud City.  
It was the private residence of the old cultivator Xu Gongfu, a figure second only to Shen Zhenze in Cloud City, who had neither family nor disciples.  
Thus, Chen Pingan settled down quietly.

At this moment, with Huan Yun, they once again faced each other in a viewing pavilion atop a faux mountain.  
Huan Yun asked, “When will this journey of introspection come to an end?”

Chen Pingan bent down and took out an item from the bamboo box—something Master Huang had refused to owe anyone a favor, a jade charm with cloud patterns, green and measuring an inch wide and two inches long, suitable for hanging against the heart. It seemed to be made of the same material as the tiles on the mountaintop Daoist temple, with just a slight difference in texture, something Chen Pingan couldn’t quite pinpoint.

On one side was an ancient inscription: “Heart.”  
On the other was a couplet:  
“In the fields, the ditches are dim and foggy;  
The doors and gates wash away the essence of the sun and moon.”

“It’s a heart charm for the Dao sect, though it’s quite rare these days.”  
Huan Yun merely glanced at it and commented nonchalantly, “In our Daoism, there has long been the saying that the Dao collects the void, which is the heart’s cultivation. In fact, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism all share broadly similar teachings.”

Chen Pingan held it in his palm, slowly tracing it, smiling, “You understand the principles, and you likely understand them better than I do.”

Huan Yun chuckled, “Unfortunately, I’m not as accomplished as the Sword Immortal.”

Chen Pingan asked, “Is it because one has high cultivation that one understands principles, or is it because principles are understood that one achieves high cultivation?”

Huan Yun replied, “The realm of a cultivator is often unrelated to principles.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “Some principles are indeed like that.”

Huan Yun said, “I still have to thank you for not heading straight to my residence.”  
Chen Pingan gently placed the heart charm on the table, taking out the other two gifts from Master Huang—a jade bracelet inscribed with a palindromic poem, within which fireflies flickered. A quaint tree gnarled pot, slowly absorbing spiritual energy.  

These were all fine items.  
Only Chen Pingan couldn’t discern just how valuable they were.  
The reason why Master Huang’s large bag seemed so bulky was due to one significant item inside. When Master Huang jostled the bag to retrieve items, the delicate clinks hinted at him having acquired something remarkable. Besides the largest item, there were at least seven or eight other assorted treasures, but he ultimately offered Chen Pingan these three. Despite this, Master Huang’s collection was still rich, but Chen Pingan felt that no matter how good the items were, they wouldn't surpass the Daoist book of Liu Guibao and the token of the mansion lord, Sun Qing.

The reason Chen Pingan knew this was purely due to his own nature.  
It seemed inconsequential not to know. After all, he wouldn’t be competing with Master Huang.  
Whether one knows or not, does it really make a difference?  
Of course, it does—and it’s a world apart.

The veins of the human heart flow like water through a riverbed; trivial matters are like water, while the myriad changes of the world are as numerous as the hairs on cattle. The heart is that riverbed. If you can navigate it and gather it, then it becomes a great river, deep and quiet in demeanor.  
Ultimately, one can be like that dragon, entering the sea.

Chen Pingan was on a path along the water for the young green-clad child.  
But in reality, all along, Chen Pingan's own cultivation of heart was like a dragon raising its head from the well, quietly traversing the river.

Is it hard to kill Huan Yun or Zhao Qingwan with a few strikes?  
Is it really that difficult?  
What’s hard about it?  
He has always done simple things.  
Perhaps this isn’t considered cultivation.

Huan Yun continued, “The jade bracelet itself is made from good material, and there are talisman masters who use poetry as a form of talismanic formation. Over time, it creates a scene like fire in water. This tree gnarled pot can help practitioners of Qi gather spiritual energy from heaven and earth while also refining it into suitable wood element spiritual energy. It’s not a treasure, but in the hands of those who earnestly cultivate wood techniques, it’s a valuable item they wouldn’t trade for anything.”

With this explanation, it spared Chen Pingan a lot of trouble. He wouldn’t sell this gnarled pot, and as for the jade bracelet, even if he were to sell it, he would demand an exorbitant price.  
Nevertheless, Chen Pingan still asked, “What do you think this bracelet could sell for in snowflake coins?”

Huan Yun replied, “Why not several grain rain coins?”  
Chen Pingan shook his head. “Old Zhenren, you really don’t know how to count money wisely.”

Huan Yun then stated a price—two grain rain coins.  
Even for Golden Core cultivators like Sun Qing from the Caique Mansion or Bai Bi from the Water Dragon Sect, one grain rain coin was no small sum.  
Many practitioners below the Golden Core, especially those in the Fifth Realm, might not even be able to gather a single grain rain coin as their savings, aside from their personal treasures. Even wealthy mountain and wild cultivators seldom carried several grain rain coins on them, usually saving only small summer coins for emergencies. If they truly needed money, converting small summer coins into snowflake coins was easy; any immortal ferry in the world would do just fine.

Chen Pingan smiled, “Old Zhenren, you have good taste.”  
Huan Yun’s expression was desolate. “Good taste doesn’t matter. I’m still no match for the Sword Immortal’s flair.”

Chen Pingan said, “Old Zhenren, you really need to change your temperament of being unable to stand others doing well.”  
Huan Yun sneered, “How could a mere Golden Core like me dare not listen to a Sword Immortal’s principles?”

Chen Pingan shot him a glance and said, “I’m just afraid that some principles you finally manage to listen to, you won’t be able to accept.”  
Huan Yun fell silent.

Chen Pingan, however, smiled, “But I’m a bit better than you, as I love to hear people calmly explain principles. Old Zhenren, why don’t we chat about the knowledge of talismans? Let’s spar a bit and benefit each other.”  
Huan Yun looked at this man, truly a character difficult to predict; he felt restless and unhappy, prompting the old Zhenren to involuntarily sarcastically suggest, “How about I just take out a few talisman secrets? Lay them on the table, and when Chen Sword Immortal says to turn the page, I’ll turn it?”

Chen Pingan ignored him, carefully putting away the jade bracelet and gnarled pot into the bamboo box, then cheerfully opened a package from the box and placed an item heavily on the table.  
It was a piece of blue brick pried from the ground of the mountaintop Daoist temple.

Huan Yun began to close his eyes and meditate.  
This blue brick might very well be considered a treasured item by ordinary immortal families, meant to safeguard their homes.  
After a moment of thought, Chen Pingan took out writing materials and began to meticulously sketch the architectural style of the immortal palace ruins, especially the white jade arch bridge.  
Only the mountaintop Daoist temple would not be carelessly drawn on paper.

After finishing two sheets of paper, Chen Pingan said, “Old Zhenren, can you help me out? Draw the large buildings on the back mountain?”

Huan Yun swallowed his anger and took out pen and paper from the square inch, beginning to draw.  
Chen Pingan stood up, walked around the stone table, and looked at the old Zhenren drawing, remarking, “You have to draw better than I do, no wonder you’re a talisman master.”  
Huan Yun was about to stop.  
That person was raising his hand.  
Huan Yun had no choice but to continue.

There was no other way; though the words from that person were flattering, he held a piece of blue brick in his hand.

The next day, the item placed in the courtyard of the private residence, the immortal palace's algae well, was something Shen Zhenze of Cloud City absolutely wanted to buy.  
This Golden Core city lord seemed determined, sincerely stating that even if he had to sell everything he owned, he wanted to buy this invaluable item that could stabilize the fortunes of the mountains and waters, even offering to trade all the properties and shops in a certain street of Cloud City.

Chen Pingan did not immediately agree.  
Huan Yun also had thoughts regarding this priceless algae well.  
He just didn’t dare to voice them.  
Shen Zhenze was still hoping Huan Yun would help plead, but just thinking about that blue brick in the guy’s hand made Huan Yun’s head ache, so he declined Shen Zhenze’s offer.

At that moment, Shen Zhenze laughed in anger. “Good, you old Zhenren, don’t tell me you want to compete with me for this item?”  
Huan Yun felt no shame and straightforwardly replied, “Fortune is hard-earned; each relies on their own abilities.”  
Shen Zhenze, left with no choice, could only say that since the item had already landed in the courtyard of Cloud City, it should stay there and take root.  
Huan Yun laughed, “Walk slowly, no need to see me off.”  
Shen Zhenze departed in a huff.

Chen Ping'an made another trip to the market outside Cloudy Peak City, setting up shop as a talisman vendor this time, only selling talismans and nothing else. 

Squatting by the roadside with his hands tucked in his sleeves, he didn’t shout out to attract customers; he simply answered any inquiries that came his way. 

He recalled the news he had seen in the Mountain and Water Gazette about the wild cultivator Huang Xi set to fight the martial artist Xiu Niang at Refining Stone Mountain in a couple of days. Chen Ping'an certainly wouldn’t miss it.

After Huan Yun departed yesterday, Chen Ping'an began to carefully calculate the gains from his treasure-seeking journey. 

Aside from the scraps of wood from the deities’ statues at the Taoist temples, he had thirty-six blue bricks from the temples, a total of one hundred twenty-two pieces of emerald-green glazed tiles, droplets of water from the green bamboo leaves inside his Sword Nourishing Gourd, and, of course, a vast number of bamboo leaves and branches. 

For the time being, he was also nurturing a cluster of fragmented sword qi stored within the Gourd. Additionally, he had yet to read the last book he obtained, along with the four items gifted by Huang— a bronze mirror, a fasting token, a jade bracelet, and a tree galls pot. 

He had to factor in the rich spiritual energy absorbed into his robe from the pavilion he had visited, along with the extra trip down the River of Time.

The old immortal Huan Yun had entrusted a young child to Shen Zhenze early this morning, asking a guest elder to quietly take the child back to his mountain. 

Chen Ping'an would not interfere. Without peace of mind, how could one cultivate tranquility?

During the midnight hour, when all was still— a state highly regarded in Daoism— it was akin to the Buddhist practice of lighting incense, which could happen at any time.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an looked up with a smile and greeted someone. 

Xu Xingjiu squatted across from his stall, but found herself at a loss for words.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Are you well?"

Xu Xingjiu’s smile blossomed, "I’m well."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "That’s good to hear."

Xu Xingjiu asked, "Can I buy some talismans from you, senior?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Of course, guests are welcome. However, the price of each talisman is fixed; you don’t need to bring out that treasure you previously acquired, as I won’t accept it here."

Xu Xingjiu’s expression turned awkward. 

She indeed carried a treasure with her—two, in fact—yet not a single piece of celestial money. She felt she had miscalculated. 

After their heart-to-heart last night, she and Zhao Qingwan agreed to present their treasures as a token of gratitude.

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Since you won’t be able to partake in your joyous occasion, don’t feel guilty. Just think of that treasure as my red envelope for you."

Xu Xingjiu said, "Then I won’t delay you in your business any longer."

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "If you truly want to thank me, bring some wealthy souls over."

Xu Xingjiu forced a smile, "I’ll try my best."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "Do you seriously believe I’m joking? If it’s a matter of conscience, then it’s best not to pursue it."

Xu Xingjiu was left speechless. 

Chen Ping'an rubbed his forehead, "I was just saying it casually. Why do you take everything to heart? Isn’t it exhausting?"

Xu Xingjiu replied, "From observing your words and actions, senior, everything aligns with the Dao."

Chen Ping'an nearly broke into a cold sweat, "My mountain gate isn’t accepting disciples at the moment."

Xu Xingjiu was baffled, yet she still bowed respectfully and took her leave.

What a remarkable swordsman elder, whose words were full of profound meanings.

In the distance, a graceful young woman stood, hesitant to approach the talisman stall.

Chen Ping'an looked up and smiled, nodding in acknowledgment.

Zhao Qingwan gave a respectful bow.

Xu Xingjiu held her hand, and Zhao Qingwan bowed her head.

Xu Xingjiu observed her, speaking softly. 

Chen Ping'an kept his hands tucked in his sleeves, watching this somewhat familiar scene unfold. He felt that even though human hearts may waver, there would still be reunions amidst the mountains and waters—how delightful it was!

However, business at his stall had been far from booming, leaving something to be desired.

By the end of the day, he had sold only a few talismans, earning thirty snowflake coins.

Upon arriving at the residence left behind by the former priest, Chen Ping'an squatted in the yard, carefully polishing the slanted well against the wall, occasionally breathing out mist towards it, nearly pressing his forehead against the well.

Huan Yun, watching from the side, had a strange expression.

Could this truly be a swordsman capable of journeying the mountains with Liu Jinglong?

Finally, Huan Yun spoke, "Why did you ask me to send a message to the Patriarch Hall of the Colorful Sparrow House? You want Sun Qingwu to come see this?"

Chen Ping'an turned his back to the old immortal and said, "If you see Xu Xingjiu and Zhao Qingwan as unexpected, then Sun Qing and her three companions are also unexpected— and they could easily draw calamity. Since you think this way, I want to see if I can turn this unexpected event into something good while making a fortune. Regardless of whether the well ends up being sold to the Colorful Sparrow House, Sun Qing and the others should remember the incense connection you have with Huan Yun. Besides, you mentioned that Sun Qing, especially her disciple Liu Guibao, are both smart and straightforward people, making them worth a try."

Huan Yun asked, "Why help me so?"

Chen Ping'an gently wiped the exquisite patterns on the well with his sleeve, never turning around, and slowly said, "I’m helping the old gentleman who opened the door for me."

Huan Yun sighed, "The heart’s burdens are hard to bear."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "In the marketplaces below the mountain, every year is tough as the last."

Huan Yun fell silent.

Chen Ping'an continued, "As for Bai Bi of the Water Dragon Sect, I can’t help there. As a mere wild cultivator and talisman vendor, I feel a little intimidated in their presence."

Huan Yun said, "They are currently also in a quandary. I can find an opportunity to meet Bai Bi quietly and resolve this hidden danger."

After all, the incident involving Xu Xingjiu and Zhao Qingwan was a matter that Colorful Sparrow House’s Sun Qing and Water Dragon Sect’s Bai Bi seemed to know nothing about, yet they were fully aware of everything.

What they didn’t know was what lay ahead.

It was fortunate that these two Golden Core cultivators remained oblivious.

Only the young swordsman before them was aware.

Chen Ping'an said, "I believe it would be better for the high-level cultivators of the Water Dragon Sect to come find you, Huan Yun; this kind of favor is what people like Bai Bi truly value. Otherwise, if you are wary of my words and fear I’ll leak secrets, wouldn’t it just lead to the need to eliminate each other when an opportunity arises, seeking a clean resolution? I trust that as long as you stay in Cloudy Peak City for a while and show your face a few times, or take a trip to North Pavilion Country or Water Cloud Country to enjoy the scenery, the Water Dragon Sect will certainly come knocking. This is much better than you and Bai Bi meeting behind closed doors to conspire."

Huan Yun was taken aback for a moment before smiling, "That sounds best."

The next morning, at dawn, Sun Qing from the Colorful Sparrow House, along with her disciple Liu Guibao, arrived at Cloudy Peak City.

Shen Zhenze nearly jumped in anger but had no choice. When the two talisman boats had entered the city earlier, the enormous well had momentarily revealed its true form due to the mountain and water restrictions and protective formations.

It was likely that there were secret informants from the Colorful Sparrow House at the market, who immediately sent word to Peach Blossom Ferry.

This was quite normal; Cloudy Peak City also had secret informants at Peach Blossom Ferry.

Shen Zhenze wasn’t small-minded enough to outright deny Sun Qing entry into the city.

However, he still had the audacity to approach the residence.

If Sun Qing offered a higher price, Shen Zhenze couldn’t afford the well; would he raise the price to the point of absurdity? He wouldn’t make Shen Zhenze part with a single piece of celestial money.

In the end, if Sun Qing decided not to buy out of anger, Shen Zhenze could always sell off his possessions or even directly carve out a large piece of Cloudy Peak City land. If that still wasn’t enough, he could negotiate a loan or shamelessly borrow some money from Huan Yun.

In the yard, Chen Ping'an watched the sullen-faced Sun Qing and the leisurely raising prices Shen Zhenze.

As for the value of the well, Huan Yun couldn’t determine it either, merely stating that a price of eighty grain rain coins was certainly fair.

Chen Ping'an wore a serious expression, looking somewhat innocent and helpless.

In fact, he nearly gave Shen Zhenze a thumbs up.

Shen Zhenze had already bid up to eighty-six grain rain coins.

At this rate, Shen Zhenze could yell his price from morning till night, potentially raising it to a thousand.

Sun Qing said coldly, "Shen Zhenze, can we call it quits soon?"

Shen Zhenze smiled, "Is the Patriarch of the Sun House planning to part with it after much consideration? Then I should thank you, Patriarch Sun, on behalf of Cloudy Peak City."

Liu Guibao had remained silent the entire time.

In the yard, there were two young men and women accompanying Shen Zhenze. 

They were familiar faces—Xu Xingjiu and Zhao Qingwan.

Liu Guibao didn’t show much curiosity toward the black-robed man without a sword today; there were many oddities among the high-level cultivators in the mountains. Besides, his looks weren’t particularly impressive without the old man's mask; she saw nothing noteworthy.

However, she was keenly observing Xu Xingjiu and Zhao Qingwan, trying to uncover hints about them.

Could it be that the old immortal Huan Yun, while watching coldly, intentionally turned a blind eye to the actions of the former priest of Cloudy Peak City, actually had everything mapped out? Rather than employing a scheme to protect his reputation and obtain treasures, achieving two objectives in one go? If this were true, it would indeed be impressive.

Deep down, Chen Ping'an still hoped to sell the well to the Colorful Sparrow House.

Although Sun Daoren had left this grand world, Chen Ping'an could clearly see from Sun Daoren’s words and actions that he was rather fond of Liu Guibao. Though he ultimately decided against taking her as a disciple, citing “incompatibility with the Dao,” he still gifted her a book on the Dao. 

For Chen Ping'an, since he couldn’t carry this massive "grinding stone" around with him, it was better to go with the flow and sell it to the Colorful Sparrow House. After all, Sun Daoren had given him so many opportunities; Chen Ping'an felt he ought to do something in return to find peace of mind.

Even if it meant that they might never meet again in this lifetime.

Unless one day Chen Ping'an truly became an ascended great swordsman, then he might have the chance to venture into that realm of azure.

Some things can be done or not; if doing them would bring peace of mind, then there’s no need to hesitate.

Besides, it wouldn’t hinder his ability to earn money.

Suddenly, Sun Qing spoke to Chen Ping'an through thought, "Young Master Chen, how about thirty grain rain coins, and I’ll give you a treasure in return? Just give me a clear answer! If you don’t agree, I’ll leave right away! Rest assured, Young Master Chen, you are a valued guest of our Colorful Sparrow House. I never beat around the bush!"

That treasure was undoubtedly precious, but for Sun Qing, the well that could stabilize the fortunes of the mountains and waters was the true treasure.

Chen Ping'an was clearly taken aback.

After hesitating for a moment, he said, "Then it’s thirty grain rain coins, you can keep the treasure, and the remaining grain rain coins can be owed for now. Just tell me how much that treasure is worth in the mountains, and the Patriarch will repay me that many grain rain coins later."

Sun Qing actually refused, "The treasure is nothing but a trinket to me at the moment, even for the next hundred or so years. However, every grain rain coin earned by the Colorful Sparrow House is needed by Wu Qian and Liu Guibao— so many cultivators depend on these celestial coins. I can’t delay their training. Therefore, Young Master Chen, just say whether you are selling or not! Moreover, that treasure was something I inexplicably obtained, and I hadn’t even closed the door when I received Huan Lao's secret message, so I removed the restrictions. Young Master Chen can use it right away."

Finally, Sun Qing boldly declared, "If the deal falls through, we’ll still maintain our righteousness as valued guests; when Young Master Chen visits our Colorful Sparrow House next time, it’s uncertain whether you’ll have ordinary tea or that small mysterious wall!"

Chen Ping'an held back a laugh and replied through thought, "Then it's settled: thirty grain rain coins and a treasure."

Sun Qing burst into laughter, "Deal!"

There was no hiding her excitement at having made a deal with Young Master Chen.

Shen Zhenze felt a twinge of regret but was also fine with it.

What a stroke of luck to gain, and a fortune lost to fate.

Sun Qing turned to Shen Zhenze and said, "Regardless, the treasure was purchased by me in Cloudy Peak City, so consider it a favor I owe you."

Shen Zhenze nodded with a smile.

He took Xu Xingjiu and Zhao Qingwan along as they flew away on the wind.

Huan Yun gifted the Colorful Sparrow House a talisman boat.

Sun Qing graciously accepted it. 

Otherwise, would she really carry that well around while flying? What kind of shameless cultivator would do that?

Then, Sun Qing glanced at the well before shifting her gaze to the young swordsman named Chen.

Sun Qing soon felt relieved, thinking that it was likely due to her connection with the treasure that he had.

Chen Ping'an, aware of her thoughts, offered a calm smile.

Sun Qing felt a bit guilty. 

Her mother would undoubtedly owe the other party a great favor. Since he already possessed a treasure, this meant that the trinket she was about to part with wasn’t as valuable, leaving Sun Qing feeling somewhat helpless. It was fine though; after all, he was a friend of Liu Jinglong, and she had no reason to be overly polite with him.

Huan Yun, being perceptive, took his leave.

Sun Qing handed over the token treasure and thirty grain rain coins.

She then departed Cloudy Peak City with Liu Guibao and the well, aboard the talisman boat.

The head of the Colorful Sparrow House was grinning from ear to ear as she began drinking upon boarding the boat. She didn’t forget to look down and call out to Huan Yun, "Huan Zhenren, Cloudy Peak City isn’t very interesting; it’s just a palm-sized place where a fart in the east can be heard in the west. So, when you have time, do come visit our Colorful Sparrow House as a guest and serve as a priest; that would be even better!"

Shen Zhenze laughed and scolded, "Stop your nonsense! Huan Zhenren is already a nominal priest of Cloudy Peak City!"

Huan Yun shook his head with a smile.

But his mood was still quite pleasant.

Standing in the yard, with an extra treasure in hand, Chen Ping'an felt as if a pressing need had been resolved. He began organizing all his new and old items, categorizing them anew.

After a stick of incense had burned down, Huan Yun departed and returned.

Chen Ping'an was already seated in the pavilion atop the rockery, tilting his head and listening to the sound of the two grain rain coins clinking against each other.

Huan Yun sat opposite him, smiling as he remarked, "The room may be small, but the universe feels vast. A heart's thought can encompass the world; I used to think I understood it well, but now I realize I don’t."

Chen Ping'an continued to clink the coins, mumbling, "Knowing that you don’t know is a kind of knowing."

In truth, discussing profound principles with a Daoist Golden Core Earth Immortal made Chen Ping'an feel somewhat sheepish, but it was alright; many of his words were borrowed from his student Cui Dongshan.

Huan Yun chuckled, "If you can trust me, then I’ll set off to explore the mountains and rivers of North Pavilion Country."

Chen Ping'an put away the two grain rain coins, straightened up, and said, "I wish you success in overcoming your heart’s obstacles."

Huan Yun replied, "It’s still early. The time when I can clearly speak about this with Shen Zhenze and sincerely apologize to those two juniors will be when I have truly let go of my burdens."

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile, "You haven’t lost your charm, old sir."

Huan Yun stood up and performed a respectful bow, "Take care, friend."

Chen Ping'an stood and clasped his fists in return, "Take care."

Huan Yun departed on the wind.

On the table was left a piece of talisman paper.

Chen Ping'an collected it, treating it as a temporary safeguard.

He didn’t even plan to open it.

Next, Chen Ping'an began to carefully consider what other heavenly materials and earthly treasures were needed to refine his wooden-based life-bound item. 

In fact, before setting off from the Ruined Mountain to North Julu Island, Cui Dongshan had provided a list. The materials varied for metal, wood, and fire, and he clearly stated that these were just the foundational materials for refining different life-bound items; having them ensured that one wouldn’t go wrong, but they were still far from enough. After all, every life-bound item in the world of five elements had its own nuances. It required the gentleman to seize opportunities and carefully explore them to succeed in the refinement process.

Chen Ping'an wasn’t in a hurry to leave Cloudy Peak City.

After all, the ferry to the Dragon Palace Cave would stop at Cloudy Peak City.

Every day, aside from cultivating, Chen Ping'an would still serve as a talisman vendor at the market.

On this day, he spotted a familiar face—Jin Shan.

The wild cultivator nearly knelt to the ground in greeting upon seeing Chen Ping'an, but was stopped in his tracks. Eventually, the two squatted together at the stall.

The man intended to return the unused attack talismans, along with the last remaining talisman with some spiritual energy left in it, to the elder.

Chen Ping'an shook his head, saying, "You should keep them; they aren’t worth much."

The man adamantly refused, his voice choked with emotion. 

What had begun as a seemingly harmless treasure-seeking trip had turned out to be so perilous—how many had survived in the end?

The man felt that one needed to uphold a sense of conscience.

So he had to make this trip to Cloudy Peak City, hoping to see the one who had lost "two of his mothers."

Chen Ping'an accepted the talismans.

He smiled and said, "Once we close up shop, how about we go for a drink?"

The man grinned, "Senior, let me take care of the tab, alright?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "That works, but don’t expect any good wine."

The man’s grin widened; that made sense.

In the end, the man treated Chen Ping'an to a meal, though he felt a bit embarrassed for putting on a show. Yet he didn’t mind spending this money at all.

Cloudy Peak City had its own celestial ferry going back and forth.

The man spent a grain rain coin, boarded the ferry, and bid his farewell to the elder with a clasped fist. The elder remained courteous and polite, returning the gesture.

The ferry slowly drifted away.

After the meal, on the way to the ferry, the elder had returned the remaining talismans to him. He had to carefully hide them in his sleeve.

The elder also warned him to return home quickly, as the area around Cloudy Peak City was still not safe.

The man dared not take that lightly.

Earlier, they had talked about many things while drinking, from how his wife was virtuous and good at managing the household, to how their two children, though still young, had bright futures ahead of them. It wouldn’t be difficult for them to become scholars or even higher officials...

Now, with the alcohol wearing off, the man felt increasingly ashamed, slapping himself on the face.

After disembarking, he found a quiet spot to hide the talismans inside his boots, as he didn’t feel secure leaving them in his sleeves.

To his surprise, when he pulled them out, he discovered two golden talismans mixed in, which were completely different from the yellow paper ones he had previously.

The man stood there, dumbfounded.

He couldn’t help but recall something the elder had said during their drinking session.

"A swordsman acts for the sake of straightforwardness, not for reason."

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 648: A Different Kind of Training (Part 1)

Chen Ping'an staggered back to his residence in Cloud City, reeking of alcohol. The walls of his home were inscribed with a circle of snow-mud talismans, effective against petty thieves, though they could do little against enlightened beings. Still, it was better than nothing.

Once inside the courtyard, Chen Ping'an shook his blue robe lightly, dissipating the scent of alcohol. He stepped into the place where Xu Gongfu practiced his Taoism year-round and settled onto a meditation mat that could draw in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. The couplet he had hung on the back wall transformed the originally bare room into something akin to a study. He planned to hang it in the first floor of the bamboo house when he returned to Ruin Mountain, vowing never to sell it, treating it like a family heirloom, akin to the cursive calligraphy written by the county magistrate while intoxicated.

He took out a crimson Daoist jujube wood token, feeling the need to refine it immediately; otherwise, any Qi practitioner could easily enter once they acquired it, and merely refining the token's emptiness and gathering spiritual energy would be of little significance. 

In the world of refining, refining emptiness was like having a money talisman in hand—there would inevitably be gains and losses. Medium refinement, however, was akin to crafting an ancestral hall on a mountain peak, truly rooting in the Qi mansion, while large refinement involved the practitioner's life essence.

Before refining the nearby object, Chen Ping'an took out three treasures to admire, nourishing his spirit. Initially, within that water palace, he had conducted three transactions with the Daoist Sun. 

One was a lifelike wooden statue of the original Daoist Lord, exuding the beauty of wind and water. 

The second was a round fan, notable for its embroidery depicting a graceful lady holding the fan, playfully teasing a little yellow bird perched on a branch.

The third was a pair of Dragon King nets, inscribed with "Fighting Jiao" and "Hidden Coil."

Chen Ping'an intended to gift the wooden statue to Li Huai. As for the round fan, he decided it would be for the girl in the pink skirt. On Ruin Mountain, the busiest figure was not the steward Zhu Lian, nor the diligent Cen Yuanji, and certainly not the one who bathed in sunlight daily, Zheng Dafu, but rather the little girl Chen Ruchu. Chen Ping'an firmly believed that as long as Ruin Mountain existed, Chen Ruchu would remain tirelessly busy, carrying a water bucket and a cloth, with a jingling string of keys at her waist. Every day, without fail, she would greet Cui Cheng, pass some sunflower seeds to Pei Qian, water the flowers, and regularly visit the nearby town and county to procure necessary supplies. 

In Chen Ping'an's eyes, how could this not be considered a major affair? It was indeed significant.

Anyone with eyes could see it and should keep it in mind. 

Let alone the other practitioners outside Ruin Mountain in Longquan County, who would dare bully the girl in the pink skirt? Just try it! 

This wasn't favoritism on Chen Ping'an's part; rather, in his view, the girl in the pink skirt was the least likely to make mistakes, unmatched by anyone—himself included. 

Thus, he found it easy to converse with Daoist Sun. 

Listening to the wild cultivator Jin Shan talk about trivialities made Chen Ping'an feel quite pleased; it was a kind of comfort from two different sources.

He picked up a bamboo basket, and the other one gently shook in response. 

What he held in his hands were two genuine mountains of gold and silver.

As for how to arrange the Dragon King nets, Chen Ping'an felt somewhat uncertain. First, this pair had sustained significant damage and would require a large sum of divine money to repair. Second, although the Dragon King nets were immensely useful for catching dragons and similar beings, they were also quite particular; unlike many offensive treasures that could be used right away, if the nets lacked a unique divine technique, they might as well be throwing meat buns to dogs—vanishing without a trace.

After much contemplation, Chen Ping'an decided to take things one step at a time.

Since he now had an additional nearby object and didn't need to spend extra money, he definitely intended to purchase two swords forged at the Hate Sword Mountain, the sword cultivator's life essence. 

If the price were more affordable than anticipated, perhaps even three would suffice.

Upon reaching the Dragon Palace cave heaven, he'd first ascertain the price of the Dragon King nets and see if there were any big spenders willing to pay.

Such a rare item—why should he discuss repair costs with them? 

However, if he could avoid selling the Dragon King nets, he would. 

After all, every time it came to gifts, he couldn't keep using quantity to fool his first disciple; that just wasn't right.

Chen Ping'an began to calm his mind and gather his energy to refine the token. 

This task was not urgent, nor could it be completed in one go. 

Two hours later, he withdrew to a refining barrier and donned a robe, turning to refine the spiritual energy embodied within it. 

His mind settled. 

Unconsciously, the time reached the hour of the rat. Chen Ping'an opened his eyes, exhaled a heavy breath of turbid air, and waved his hand lightly to disperse it. 

According to Cui Dongshan's profound words, a small world of humanity had many lives exchanged. The practice of Qi practitioners emphasized refining the essence and discarding impurities, using heaven and earth's spiritual energy to temper bones, expand the Qi mansion, and cultivate the soul—all requiring meticulous effort.

Thus, practitioners were no longer mere mortals.

This was not merely a frightening saying. 

Chen Ping'an turned his consciousness to explore the Qi mansion. 

The water mansion remained unlocked, with a stream containing water spiritual energy flowing gently. This was merely the scene after Chen Ping'an had drained the dew drops from green bamboo leaves, without yet drawing the more refined and concentrated aqua energy from the azure bricks. The green-clad boys were increasingly busy, and the meticulously painted river murals in the water mansion were becoming more vibrant under their efforts.

The small pond suspended beneath the water character seal seemed to have expanded slightly, with the water deepening.

Chen Ping'an hesitated over whether to refine the aqua energy azure bricks from the Daoist temple and lay them down in the water mansion. 

Even without the faintest trace of aqua energy, the azure bricks were valuable in their own right.

He initially planned to take back the thirty-six aqua energy azure bricks to Ruin Mountain, which would perfectly pave six small paths for practicing the Six Steps of the Mountain Shaking Fist. 

There would be himself, Pei Qian, Zhu Lian, Zheng Dafu, Cen Yuanji. 

Of course, there was also the highly compatible Lu Baixiang.

As for Wei Xian, he could be left out. 

As for Sui You, he was already at the Yuguizong on Tongyezhou, transitioning from a pure martial artist to a practitioner, hoping to become a female sword immortal who could soar with her sword in the realm of righteousness.

However, if the azure bricks could enhance the water mansion, then the six bricks belonging to Chen Ping'an could definitely be refined.

With the water character seal above, azure bricks on the floor, and murals on the walls, Chen Ping'an felt that this way, his water mansion could be considered quite impressive.

As for the one hundred and twenty-two green glazed tiles, he would keep them for now, as their origins were unclear. 

Huan Yun had also not dared to rashly conclude anything, only confirming that they were undoubtedly worth a fortune. If they were of the same origin as the Glazed Pavilion in the White Emperor City of the Central Plains, that would be even more astonishing.

Legend had it that the most precious items in the Glazed Pavilion, besides the twelve glazed beams, were the glazed tiles atop the roof.

Chen Ping'an retracted his spirit, rose from the room, and began practicing the Six Steps of the Mountain Shaking Fist in the courtyard. 

Unexpectedly, a visitor hurriedly arrived.

It was Wu Qian, the Grandmaster of the Colorful Sparrow Manor, his face bursting with joy.

Chen Ping'an led Wu Qian to the pavilion atop the artificial hill. Wu Qian had come to present Chen Ping'an with a first-rate robe from the Colorful Sparrow Manor. 

Wu Qian mentioned that a certain well had been moved to the manor and was remarkably compatible with their landscape. Not only could it stabilize the terrain, but it could also gather luck from all directions. Even without refining it yet, merely placing it in the ancestral hall had already shown miraculous signs. After refining it, it would be a foundation item that only sects and ancestral halls could possess. Thus, the deal with Cloud City had been far too profitable for her, and feeling guilty, she had to send a robe as compensation. If Chen Jianxian refused, that was fine; she had already been polite, and if Chen Jianxian also followed suit, then she wouldn't hold back.

Chen Ping'an repeatedly said he wouldn't be polite, accepting the exquisitely crafted robe from Wu Qian and placing it into his token.

The only downside was that the robe's style was too flamboyant—less to his taste than the snowflake robe worn by the ghostly woman of Skin City, which he could wear comfortably.

Wu Qian didn't linger long, but left behind several large jars of tea, saying this was the remaining small Xuanbi from the Colorful Sparrow Manor this year. 

Wu Qian added with a smile, "If Chen Jianxian plans to sell it, please do sell it for a high price; otherwise, it wouldn't do justice to the name of the small Xuanbi."

Chen Ping'an felt a bit embarrassed and said, "Please inform Manor Master Sun that I will set aside a jar of small Xuanbi as a gift."

Wu Qian smiled knowingly and nodded, taking off on the wind.

Just as Wu Qian left, Shen Zhenze arrived. 

Chen Ping'an had just sat down and had to rise to greet him.

The lord of Cloud City chuckled, "Wu Qian wouldn't be inviting you, Chen Xiansheng, to be a mountain offering, would she? You mustn't go, you mustn't go! It's just a lot of fluttering flowers that will distract you from your practice."

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "The Colorful Sparrow Manor has no such intentions."

After Shen Zhenze took a seat, he said, "If the Colorful Sparrow Manor has no such eye for talent, why not let Chen Xiansheng take a name with us? Aside from the annual offering of divine money, this residence, along with all thirty-two residences and shops on Xu Yu Street in Cloud City, would belong entirely to you."

Chen Ping'an replied, "It's not that I don't want to agree, Lord of the City, but I truly cannot."

His journey to North Julu Prefecture had been fraught with dangers.

The events in the Bone Marsh and Jingguan City, hiring assassins from the Deer-cutting Mountain behind the scenes, and the death of Huai Qian, weighed heavily on him. 

Chen Ping'an did not wish to involve more people or entangle them in danger; he preferred to travel alone, accompanied only by his fists, sword, and wine, for a more refreshing experience.

Thus, Shen Zhenze refrained from further persuasion. 

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Lord of the City, though I cannot accept your generous offer to become a tenant quietly collecting rent in Cloud City, I appreciate your good intentions. Whenever I feel it's the right time, I will surely come to Cloud City to ask for a Xu Yu Street."

Shen Zhenze nodded, "Then it's settled." 

Even if he, Shen Zhenze, could not wait for that day, it was fine; Cloud City still had Xu Xinger wine.

Shen Zhenze was a forthright man.

He didn't linger unnecessarily, stating his business before leaving. 

Chen Ping'an took the opportunity to ask for some mountain and water reports from Cloud City, both old and new. 

Shen Zhenze agreed, saying he would have Xu Xinger send them over. 

Chen Ping'an then walked around the stone table in the pavilion, practicing his stance, in a trance, with his fist intent flowing throughout his body. 

After two hours of practicing, he returned home for a short rest before sitting back on the mat to start refining the spiritual energy. 

As noon approached, Chen Ping'an took out the spiritual artifact he had received from the Pi Ma Sect's ferry, placing it on the stone table in the pavilion. It was a blue porcelain pen wash, which, once the restrictions of the Tili Mountain were lifted, would reveal the wondrous scenery of the mountains above, visible only to those not leaving North Julu Prefecture. If viewed from a distant continent, it would appear fuzzy.

Though Chen Ping'an had constructed a water mansion, he actually possessed no water techniques, so he had to create a large river flow talisman from yellow paper, gently tearing it apart, causing the wash to fill with water, shrouded in mist. 

Instantly, a vast, flat blue stone platform appeared above the pen wash; this was Tili Mountain, the most renowned mountain in North Julu Prefecture, more familiar to practitioners than any imperial mountain.

On the flat stone platform, neither party had yet appeared.

The scenery beyond the platform was obscured, like the fog of the immortal ruins, with a clear boundary existing.

This made Chen Ping'an regretful, as he had originally wanted to see the viewing mountain purchased by the Qionglin Sect. 

This sect, known for its "Two Sleeves of Clear Wind Qionglin Sect, Unmatched Power in the Yupu Realm," was one of the main parties with whom Chen Ping'an sought to interact during his travels in North Julu Prefecture. Naturally, he did not admire the Yupu Realm sect leader who boasted of being "defeated by the sword immortal at the fifth realm," but rather this wealth-rolling Qionglin Sect, the largest buyer from another continent of the Life Pearl Cave's life essence porcelain back then.

Chen Ping'an certainly did not intend to seek out the Qionglin Sect.

His Bagua Zhai was not to be wasted; he needed the other party to come to him. 

How to negotiate reasonably, at what time, and where to meet all required Chen Ping'an to tread carefully, step by step, laying the groundwork and timing perfectly. 

A sect with a mountain gate that could be mocked by practitioners across the continent indicated that the other side was extremely restrained. While being restrained, they might act without any bottom line, and that was the truly frightening opponent.

Xu Xinger arrived with a large pile of mountain and water reports, smiling, "Chen Xiansheng, are you also looking at Tili Mountain?"

Chen Ping'an accepted the reports and smiled, inviting, "If you're not busy, sit down and look together."

Chen Ping'an took out two jars of immortal wine, handing one to Xu Xinger, and they sat facing each other, slowly drinking.

In the battle of Tili Mountain, among the ten young practitioners of North Julu Prefecture, the wild cultivator Huang Xi and the martial artist Xiu Niang ranked closely, one fourth and the other fifth.

In a recent mountain and water report, there were many new speculations about the two's life-and-death battle, some suggesting it was a matter of love turned to hate, while others indicated that Huang Xi, though still young, had been too ruthless, inadvertently killing Xiu Niang's loved ones.

Xu Xinger tossed a snowflake coin onto the pen wash, which instantly vanished, transforming into a strand of spiritual energy, merging into the mountain and water energy of Tili Mountain miles away. All spiritual artifacts capable of carrying the mirror flower water moon had this "money-eating" ability.

Previously, it had been the Taihui Sword Sect's Qi Jinglong and the Taiping Mountain's female immortal Huang Ting, caught in a fight. Both were bottlenecked Yuan Ying sword cultivators, and their battle had significantly impacted the aura of Tili Mountain. After that fight, the spiritual energy of Tili Mountain had been severely depleted. If the battle reached the fifth realm, it would surely consume even more of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. Yet, Tili Mountain remained abundant in spiritual energy, thanks to the countless watching practitioners continuously throwing divine money into the mix. 

Xu Xinger hesitated for a moment and tentatively asked, "Chen Xiansheng, if I have the opportunity to leave the mountain and travel in the future, may I visit Mr. Liu at the Taihui Sword Sect?"

Xu Xinger blushed slightly, "I've always admired Mr. Liu."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "I can give you a heads-up, but I can't guarantee that Liu Jinglong will definitely meet you."

Xu Xinger's eyes lit up, quickly getting up to bow in thanks. 

Chen Ping'an reminded, "Remember one thing: when you go to visit Liu Jinglong at the Taihui Sword Sect, make sure to bring a few jars of good wine. When you meet, just drink to your heart's content first; Mr. Liu loves wine but usually doesn't let his guard down. Someone must take the lead. If he says he doesn't drink, don't believe him; it means you haven't poured enough."

Xu Xinger exclaimed, "I see! So, Liu Xiansheng is just like the land-bound dragon I imagined, exactly! A sword immortal who prefers reason must be a person of great character!"

Chen Ping'an nodded vigorously, "Absolutely."

Looking at Tili Mountain on the table, Chen Ping'an waved his sleeves, and the blue stone platform of Tili Mountain suddenly expanded in all directions.

He and Xu Xinger stood like "two towering deities" on Tili Mountain, amidst the stone platform.

However, the more important the mountain and water, the greater the restrictions, and the rank of the spiritual artifacts carrying the mirror flower water moon would also affect the viewing experience.

Chen Ping'an discovered that his blue porcelain pen wash could only see the minuscule figures of Huang Xi and Xiu Niang.

He had once asked Qi Jinglong whether the sword energy of the great sword immortal could be used to kill someone across the distance at Tili Mountain.

At that time, Qi Jinglong shook his head, laughing, saying that while it might be possible for an immortal, it was unrealistic for a Yupu Realm practitioner because sword cultivators' sword energy emphasized sword intent and was fundamentally different from the pure spiritual energy of divine money. Any hint of intention could cause fragile spiritual artifacts carrying the mirror flower water moon to shatter on the spot. However, Qi Jinglong also mentioned that some ancient divine techniques and side methods existed on the mountain, historically exploiting the mirror flower water moon to harm certain mountains profiting from it. But practitioners using such means must carefully hide their identities; otherwise, they could easily become enemies across the continent, as it might pique the curiosity of immortals and even ascended masters.

As noon approached, approximately another incense stick's worth of time remained.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an noticed a fine ripple appear in the sky over Tili Mountain.

Then a voice echoed, "Where is the invincible Yupu Realm from the Qionglin Sect?"

Soon the landscape of Tili Mountain rippled again, and someone responded, "I do not know what guidance you seek, senior."

The first speaker evidently dropped a divine coin with a laugh, saying, "I regret giving birth to you back then."

The dignified Yupu Realm practitioner of the Qionglin Sect, surprisingly good-tempered, not only did not retort but also tossed a grain rain coin back, respectfully replying, "Senior is jesting."

The two ceased their conversation.

However, someone suddenly smiled and said, "Congratulations, Sect Leader, have you made a decision? If you do not speak, I will take it as your agreement."

Xu Xinger whispered, "That must be Xu Xuan."

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Xu Xuan, the top disciple of the North's greatest sword immortal Bai Chang, ranked second among the young practitioners, surpassing Qi Jinglong.

A weathered voice sounded, "Aiyo, am I to drink to your wedding with Xu Xuan and He Xiaoliang? Such a match made in heaven, I must have this cup of wedding wine."

A cold female voice replied, "I already have a dao companion."

An uproar ensued.

"Congratulations, Sect Leader He."

"May I ask, Sect Leader, who is the person you are joining with?"

"Sect Leader He, my heart has shattered; henceforth, the world will lose one more infatuated person."

Finally, Xu Xuan's words caused the commotion to cease, "No worries, if he dies, you will lose your divine partner."

He Xiaoliang coldly smiled, "Why don't you and I set a time to visit Tili Mountain? If you dare to kill him, I will ensure Bai Chang's incense is severed."

Xu Xuan fell silent.

Xu Xinger lamented, "I never expected that Sect Leader He, such a divine person, would have a dao companion. I truly wonder which man has such fortune."

Xu Xinger suddenly noticed the sword immortal's expression across the table was not too pleasant.

Chen Ping'an lowered his head and took a sip of wine, his expression returning to normal.

As noon approached.

A white rainbow soared through the sky, descending in the central area of Tili Mountain's stone platform.

At the edge of Tili Mountain, a woman wearing a veil stepped onto the blue stone platform, with a long knife and short sword hanging at her waist.

Chen Ping'an manipulated the mist rising from the Tili Mountain painting, attempting to ensure both combatants appeared within the painting, though the clarity of their faces was not essential.

In fact, many Qi practitioners observing Tili Mountain through the mirror flower water moon might not have seen the specifics of either side’s actions, merely enjoying the spectacle. It was destined that many fifth realm practitioners would hardly see the figures on the painting, at most catching glimpses of the brilliance emitted from offensive treasures and divine techniques.

Thus, there had long been rumors on the mountains of North Julu Province that unless one was a Golden Core Earth Immortal, there was no hope of discerning any nuances in the battles at Tili Mountain.

As for the martial artist Xiu Niang's background, especially regarding her martial arts lineage, no mountain and water reports from North Julu Province could clarify.

Xu Xinger soon began to feel fortunate that she was here instead of watching the Tili Mountain battle beside her master. Usually, when watching the Tili Mountain battles with her master, Shen Zhenze would adjust the angle of the painting, constantly shrinking its size, but they would still miss many critical scenes. However, in Xu Xinger's view, it couldn't compare to the precision with which the sword immortal before her grasped the battle situation, observing the elusive Xiu Niang, her punches, and Huang Xi's overwhelming techniques and the dispatch of offensive treasures. Though there were still some omissions, Xu Xinger found that this was her first time witnessing the Tili Mountain battle so "clearly," where everything was interconnected, allowing her to roughly see the flow of the two sides' conflict.

Chen Ping'an focused intently on the battle, continuously adjusting the painting.

The martial artist, for the moment, revealed her true strength as a genuine distant traveler, with exceptionally fast punches and a solid physique.

This was still before she had drawn her blade.

As for whether she was a mountain top martial artist, they would wait and see.

Though the appearance and age of martial arts masters were not as difficult to discern as those of mountain cultivators, the higher the realm of pure martial artists, the faster they ascended, making it less likely for the two to directly intertwine. 

Especially for female martial artists, this applied even more; they could similarly delay the signs of aging.

Huang Xi was an extremely young Yuan Ying practitioner, younger than Qi Jinglong by a few years, ranking third and fourth among the list, all under one hundred years old.

The existence of such talented practitioners itself was a pressure, making those who were often two or three hundred years old, Golden Core Earth Immortals, question if they had lost so much time to the dogs.

Suddenly, the painting of the mountains and waters became blurred, swaying unsteadily.

Chen Ping'an was momentarily stunned.

Xu Xinger quickly tossed a few snowflake coins, and the painting regained clarity.

Chen Ping'an felt that the mirror flower water moon of this immortal mountain was indeed a highly profitable business, but if Ruin Mountain were to enter this line of work in the future, how would they make money? Would they rely on Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafu to tell stories? Chen Ping'an worried that Ruin Mountain’s reputation might become notorious; when his disciples ventured down the mountain, perhaps women would be fine, but wouldn't men be treated like thieves? 

Other avenues were hard for Chen Ping'an to conceive; should he invite Qi Jinglong to Ruin Mountain as a scholar and have a philosophical discussion once or twice? Or was it best for Zhu Lian, the old chef, to prepare a grand feast? Or perhaps Pei Qian could perform a set of mad sword techniques? Have Wei Bo engage in chess matches with others?

Chen Ping'an pushed aside these distractions and continued to focus on the battle.

For some reason, both sides seemed in no hurry to determine life or death.

Xu Xinger was already feeling a bit dizzy from watching and took a sip of wine to steady herself.

Chen Ping'an remained as steady as a mountain, continuing to manipulate the mirror flower water moon painting.

Xu Xinger found herself increasingly impressed by him.

Chen Ping'an asked, "In the long history of Tili Mountain battles, what was the longest one?"

Xu Xinger replied, "The longest recorded battle involved a Yupu Realm sword immortal and an immortal realm practitioner. One attacked with full force, while the other defended with all their might. The two were evenly matched and apparently fought for over a month."

Chen Ping'an rubbed his forehead; if he watched to the end, how many snowflake coins would it take?

Xu Xinger added, "There was also a battle between two sword immortals that lasted only half an hour, completely exhausting Tili Mountain's spiritual energy. No matter how hard the watchers threw divine money, it would be a drop in the bucket. Thus, in that astonishing battle, only the residences near Tili Mountain could see some semblance of what happened; however, they said the sword energy had overflowed from Tili Mountain. To protect their mountain from being affected, the Qionglin Sect had to activate their mountain and water formation, consuming over a hundred grain rain coins all at once and borrowing two hundred from the mountain's practitioners, repaying them double afterward. Since then, the Qionglin Sect has always kept three hundred grain rain coins stored on the mountain, steadily preserved."

Xu Xinger, full of spiritual energy, suddenly stood up, intending to take her leave. 

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Good news, once the cave opens, you can ascend to view the vast sea."

Xu Xinger soared off, and Cloud City had prepared her breakthrough location.

She had been on the brink of a breakthrough for days, just waiting for a subtle opportunity. 

After Xu Xinger left, her master Shen Zhenze would naturally help guard her.

Whether in three to five days or two to three years, no one could say for certain; it wasn’t necessarily the case that breaking through faster was better, nor that breaking through slower was more stable; it all depended on seizing opportunities.

A hundred bones and orifices, breezes of clarity. In the depths of the water, the true face could be seen.

Unfortunately, Chen Ping'an had yet to experience this phenomenon.

His path as a Qi practitioner in the third realm had been circuitous, with some minor bumps.

Chen Ping'an continued to observe the battle.

At Tili Mountain, both sides were filled with murderous intent.

Yet they remained in mutual testing, evidently searching for a chance to strike a decisive blow.

Chen Ping'an had already tossed down several snowflake coins.

Having taken a few sips of wine, he had only ever picked up snacks from the bowl, never tossing them into the dish. 

The two combatants were behaving a bit unfairly.

An hour later, Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged on a stone bench, one hand propping up his chin, with a small mountain of snowflake coins piled beside him.

From the looks of those two, it seemed they could fight for quite a while.

After another hour or so, the peak of Chen Ping'an's snowflake coin mound had flattened out.

A distinguished figure tossed down a grain rain coin, laughing and scolding, "You two lovebirds! If you really want to love and kill each other, why must you waste others' divine money! Huang Xi, since you are a sword cultivator, if you manage to survive Tili Mountain, you'll eventually have to receive a sword from me!"

It turned out that the wild cultivator Huang Xi was actually a concealed sword cultivator.

And that martial artist Xiu Niang also surprised everyone, as she was well-versed in many immortal techniques.

While it appeared they were mutually refining their skills, as they clashed, the murderous intent was heavy, and Chen Ping'an was quite curious about what enmity existed between them that they had to fight to the death in front of countless spectators at Tili Mountain.

At a certain moment during the incense stick, Chen Ping'an stood up, suddenly crushing a handful of snowflake coins into spiritual energy, striving to maintain the mountain and water painting he had created with the blue porcelain pen wash.

That female martial artist seemed to have unleashed a high-ranking mountain artifact, bathing Tili Mountain in brilliant sunlight, making it somewhat blinding even through the painting.

This caused the mountain and water energy of Tili Mountain to become chaotic, making it hard for the spectators to see clearly. 

Chen Ping'an could only faintly make out a thin black line slicing through the radiant light enveloping the world.

Moments later…

On the stone platform of Tili Mountain.

Half of Huang Xi's flesh had nearly dissolved, leaving behind only a half skeleton, yet he remained alive, while the astonishingly skilled female martial artist Xiu Niang had vanished without a trace, leaving uncertain whether her body and soul had perished or if she had successfully escaped at the brink of life and death.

Huang Xi shook himself, taking a few steps before soaring into the air, leaving Tili Mountain.

Chen Ping'an sighed, realizing that as long as the realms of combatants weren't too disparate, countless techniques ultimately didn't measure up to a single sword.

A sword could break through myriad techniques.

Chen Ping'an collected the blue porcelain pen wash and the pile of snowflake coins.

This observation had yielded some insights.

The way the female martial artist Xiu Niang executed her punches and the essence of her fist style was quite intriguing, resembling another extreme compared to Gu You's Mountain Shaking Fist and the fist techniques of Cui Cheng from the bamboo house.

In the pavilion, Chen Ping'an mimicked a rough imitation of her fist style, slowly executing the stance.

After a moment, he stopped, realizing he couldn't learn it, lacking any inkling of her fist intent.

However, the real gain was not in the stance but in expanding Chen Ping'an's understanding of the world's fist techniques, enabling him to be more aware when facing opponents in the future.

Chen Ping'an began to close his eyes and cultivate, striving to remember her fist intent, even if he could only imitate a few aspects; at least it would serve as a form of deception.

After opening his eyes, Chen Ping'an started to walk around, practicing and rehearsing. Once he had a rough understanding, he suddenly remembered a sorrowful matter.

The golden talismans were running low.

There were only ten left.

He had to be frugal.

The ancient talismans recorded in the **"Dan Shu Zhen Ji"** were now beyond his ability to draw as a mere third realm Qi practitioner; aside from the basic talismans like the **Yang Qi Talisman**, he couldn't create more.

In fact, drawing talismans as a pure martial artist was easier than doing so as a Qi practitioner, with a higher rank.

Unfortunately, talismans drawn by martial artists could not close mountain gates, and the spiritual light of the talisman dissipated too quickly.

Chen Ping'an took out those ten golden talismans from his Bagua Zhai, counting and checking them carefully, knowing none could magically appear.

Leaving the pavilion, he sat on the mat in his room, took down the sword immortal from the wall, placing it horizontally across his knees, then retrieved the sword nurturing gourd, carefully guiding the shattered sword energy away from it.

For the next full ten days, the young talisman seller was nowhere to be seen in the markets outside Cloud City.

In the capital of Dali, the young emperor convened a small court meeting in his study, as was customary. 

More than twenty officials gathered, and the small room felt slightly cramped with so many people.

The oldest among them was the Minister of Personnel, Old Master Guan, who seemed to have spent too much energy on the grand court meeting, now dozing in his chair, holding a small charcoal basket wrapped in cotton cloth—a gift from the late emperor, managed by the palace eunuchs, always brought to the small court meeting in winter without needing a reminder from Old Master Guan. 

At present, the old man had begun to snore lightly, but from the emperor to the other Dali ministers, no one indicated they would remind him; whenever it came to a serious topic, he would wake up and say a few words.

At that moment, a robust middle-aged deputy minister of the Ministry of Justice was reporting an important matter to everyone.

The female cultivator known as Shi Qiu had been rescued and was now missing. 

Previously, two groups of servants and assassins from the Zhu Ying Dynasty, varying in skill but uniformly cautious and steady, had traveled across continents to North Julu Prefecture, to the Tili Mountain, investigating the records of the ferry's owner from years ago, hoping to uncover key clues linking the Dali Dynasty with the Tili Mountain to frame Zhu Ying's sword practitioners.

In fact, one group had already succeeded but did not take the intercontinental ferry back to Baopingzhou, instead taking a detour across the sea, only to be intercepted and killed by Dali's cultivators at sea.

The most troublesome was the woman from the Tili Mountain named Qiu Shi. 

In the process of observing the mirror flower water moon, she had revealed a critical piece of information: that the sword-wielding gentleman from North Julu was the one who had framed Zhu Ying's Dynasty. This woman hoped that someone could relay this matter to the Heavenly Lord Xie Shi, as she, Qiu Shi, was willing to sacrifice her life to prove the truth of this matter.

Now, the mountain where Qiu Shi had been sheltered had been sealed off by Dali's Qi practitioners.

Yuan's family, the pillar of the state, was a thin-faced old man, rubbing his palms with a smile, "What a butterfly effect, I wonder what our National Master is busy with in the Green Wave Pavilion."

The burly head of the Cao family leaned against his chair, sneering, "Even if the Green Wave Pavilion makes a mistake, at least they do more actual work than you, Yuan Yunshui, who only knows how to spit venom in the court, nitpicking as the best at it."

The head of the Yuan family smiled, "Cao Qiao, I am still a pillar of the state, as for whether you think you are a great pillar of the state, I am unsure."

The Minister of Rites was lost in thought.

As a key figure in charge of many mountain gods, if it were not for the conspicuousness of his official robe, he would be an inconspicuous middle-aged man. He actively spoke up, interrupting the two state pillars' petty squabbles, with a stern face, saying, "Lord Cao, Lord Yuan, every word spoken here in this small court meeting can determine the fortune and misfortune of the Dali people. Can we set aside personal grudges for now?"

An elderly member of the Song family, now managing the royal genealogy of the Dali Song family, chuckled, "My goodness, I almost thought the Dali dynasty was surnamed Yuan or Cao, scaring this old fellow with the surname Song."

A short yet sturdy martial general, not like Cao Ping or Su Gaoshan, who led iron cavalry south, sat in his chair looking somewhat comical, yet his words held weight, speaking solemnly, "Instead of wasting time here, it would be better to deal with that troublesome Tili Mountain woman. If the Green Wave Pavilion enjoys living off others, then let my subordinates handle it and guarantee no trace of the rescuer will remain."

The young emperor did not sit behind the desk but moved a chair closer to the ministers and remained silent, sitting by the fireplace, bending down to warm himself.

Beside him was an ordinary yellow wood chair that had been placed in this room for over a hundred years.

Several emperors of the Dali dynasty had "grown up" under the watchful eye of this chair.

The late emperor had touched it but never sat on it, and the new emperor had also only touched it without sitting down.

That dragon throne had changed hands many times, yet this chair, which seldom saw anyone sit upon it, had never been replaced.

In the corridor outside the study, an old eunuch quietly announced, "The National Master has arrived."

All the high-ranking Dali officials qualified to attend this small court meeting stood to greet him, even Old Master Guan shifted in his seat, propping his hands on the armrest of his chair as if he had awakened, then stood to welcome the embroidered tiger.

Though the young emperor did not rise to greet him, he did straighten his back.

An old Confucian scholar stepped through the threshold, bowing to the young emperor with no trace of arrogance in his demeanor.

Emperor Song He nodded with a smile.

Cui Zhen sat in his chair, turning to the old Minister of Personnel, who was still leaning on the armrest, and asked, "Old Minister Guan, are you planning to stand or sit?"

Old Master Guan smiled, "Forgive me, National Master, at this age, aside from squatting down to relieve myself, I can only take advantage of little things, everything else is difficult."

Cui Zhen waved his hand, "Let's discuss serious matters."

Once the National Master arrived, the atmosphere in the entire study turned solemn.

Everyone involuntarily sharpened their focus. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 649: A Different Kind of Training (Part Two)

Cui Zhan spoke, "Today, I plan to discuss the current state and trends of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, Shujian Lake, and the Qingluan Kingdom with you all. If we can establish our respective regulations, then in the future, both the mountains and valleys of Baoping Continent will have laws to follow and principles to adhere to. Thus, the discussions today will effectively decide the future national strength of our Great Li for the next century. Everything said today will be recorded verbatim; anyone who coughs even once, dozes off, drinks tea, or speaks nonsensically, as well as those who offer valuable insights that benefit the Great Li dynasty, will be clearly noted. In the future, all emperors and ministers still qualified to sit in this room will see it clearly."

Cui Zhan concluded, "Whether His Majesty can become the first monarch in the history of Baoping Continent, and whether our Great Li cavalry can force everyone in this vast world to keep their eyes wide open and remember the name of the Great Li Emperor, depends entirely on your actions and words today."

Cui Zhan stood, his expression solemn.

In the small court meeting, the young emperor slowly rose, his heart stirred with emotion.

The civil officials stood and bowed. The military generals rose and clasped their fists.

In Jin Jia Continent, an ancient battlefield lay strewn with the ruins of collapsed statues. Here, the fierce winds could make any Qi practitioner below the Golden Core stage feel as if they were suffering in hell after just a short while. Many pure martial artists came to this place to hone their bodies, but most never left alive. The sudden bursts of wind, unpredictable and sharp as sword energy, could envelop a radius of ten miles, crushing even those at the Golden Body stage to dust.

A young woman, who once broke through her limits with unparalleled strength, had the unique talent to wander and reside here for many years. Currently, she was throwing punches like thunder at a slowly advancing man in white.

The man was merely at the Golden Body stage. For an ordinary martial artist at this level, she might have been able to kill him with a single punch. Yet, despite throwing thousands of punches at this younger Golden Body warrior, every single one was nullified by his own intent.

In simple terms, he wasn't even retaliating. This pure martial artist, who hoped to reach the strongest level, had not even managed to touch the hem of his garment.

This young man in white was indeed just at the Golden Body stage.

Unfortunately, he was Cao Ci, who had traveled from the Central Divine Continent to here.

Every stage Cao Ci possessed marked a level of martial arts never seen before. The girl, who had been honing her skills here for a long time, had once found this hard to believe. But she had gone through a complex emotional journey: eager to try, testing him with punches, giving it her all, gradually becoming desperate, and then numb.

Just when she was about to stop, Cao Ci finally spoke for the second time, "Since your fist intent has been rising, why stop now?"

After that, the young woman gritted her teeth and continued to throw punches in anger.

Earlier, Cao Ci's first remark came after Liu Youzhou had spoken. At that time, Liu Youzhou from Aiai Continent, bolstered by Cao Ci's presence, had made a harsh remark, "Hua Qian is right; in Cao Ci's eyes, your six realms are nothing but paper and clay, easily shattered."

Cao Ci, not wanting her to misunderstand, had to clarify with his first words upon meeting her, "I never said such a thing."

Now, Liu Youzhou was squatting on the palm of a fallen statue, where a dense cluster of flowers and grass had grown. They had not been swept away by the fierce winds of the ancient battlefield, which was indeed strange.

Liu Youzhou couldn't understand how someone from a top sect, one that had produced many who ranked among the top ten in the Central Continent, would cause such a big misunderstanding over a mere marriage contract with Hua Qian. They weren't even being asked to become immortal partners; it was just a piece of paper. A name on that paper wouldn't impose any substantial restrictions on them. If it were him, as long as the price was fair, he could sell himself without hesitation.

Cao Ci had been visiting and admiring the ruins, examining each statue closely, hoping to discern some martial intent from them. In fact, he had indeed gleaned quite a bit. Thus, the girl’s efforts would inevitably result in futility because her growth in fist intent would always lag behind Cao Ci.

Standing before a half-destroyed statue, Cao Ci paused, gazing upward as if struck by a sword, a gash appearing from his shoulder down to his waist.

The girl in white paused her punches, bent over with hands on her knees, and coughed up blood.

Seeing this, Liu Youzhou felt his scalp tingle, realizing that every talented pure martial artist in the world was a bit mad. It was still better to cultivate. As long as one had enough treasures, one could comfortably hide in their shell. 

For instance, during this journey, he had accompanied Cao Ci far and wide, having traveled to Liuxia Continent, and now to Jin Jia Continent. Besides several treasured robes, he had two pieces of incense spirit armor on him. However, he had given one of them to his friend Hua Qian years ago.

Though he called them friends, they were merely acquaintances, bonded by family ties rather than true camaraderie. Unlike the usual fair-weather friends who sought to borrow from him, the young master of Aiai Continent, Liu Youzhou, found more of a connection with Hua Qian, who never sought to take advantage of him.

Often, Liu Youzhou wished he could tell those who borrowed treasures and seldom returned them that it wasn't about their intelligence; rather, he had a persistent bad habit of feeling uncomfortable unless he gave things away. Fortunately, his parents were never strict about it. One time, when he genuinely gifted a treasure to a close friend, he later found out that the friend had not regarded him as a true friend. This left the young Liu heartbroken.

His father then took him to the Liu family's treasure mountain, an actual mountain. The wealthy man asked his only son how many years he thought he would live if he gave away one item every day.

Liu Youzhou calculated and provided an accurate number. His father then opened a secret prohibition, revealing an even more magnificent treasure mountain behind the first, so splendid that the colorful light nearly blinded the child.

Liu Youzhou immediately burst into tears, overwhelmed by the wealth of his family. That day, he left the family’s forbidden area, laden with treasures, beaming with joy, though he didn't forget to wipe his snot and tears on his father's sleeve.

That day, the Aiai Continent's god of wealth, who never usually disciplined his son, imparted a family lesson: "Making money is easy, but keeping it without inviting disaster is hard. How to spend it without attracting trouble is a challenge."

He shared painful lessons from their family history with the young boy. Liu Youzhou learned that for a family with a rich legacy, if they didn't exercise caution, merely following old paths to make money could turn that wealth into a source of disaster.

Liu Youzhou had only been slapped by his father once. After a family friend who was known for dubious dealings fell into trouble, he lent the friend some money to weather the storm, comforting him and even scolding those responsible. Of course, he received his due share of the profits. However, right after his friend left, his father appeared, slapped Liu so hard that he bled, and demanded to know where he went wrong. When Liu replied that he shouldn't have lent money, he got slapped again and fell to the ground.

Liu Youzhou struggled to rise, sitting on the ground without saying a word. His father sneered, saying there was nothing wrong with business dealings; the purest thing in the world was money.

To this day, Liu Youzhou had never received a complete answer from his father. Perhaps it was a paper left by the merchant's ancestor to the Liu family. The eight characters written on that paper were: "Wealth with a Conscience, or It Will All Be Scattered."

Now, Liu Youzhou squatted among the flowers and grass in the palm of the broken statue, sighed, and thought, every family has its burdens to bear, hoping he could delay becoming the head of the Liu family and avoid dealing with conscience for a while longer.

He inquired from afar to Cao Ci, "When do you think Hua Qian will return from the North Julu Continent?"

Cao Ci replied with an "mm." 

Liu Youzhou rolled his eyes. This was Cao Ci's way of saying he hadn't thought about it and wouldn’t.

Liu frequently asked him all sorts of random questions. Cao Ci probably thought that without a clear response, it would be impolite, so he would often just acknowledge Liu's question.

The young woman saw an opportunity and threw a powerful punch. However, there was a crack in her wrist, and as she fell to the ground, her shoulder swayed, and after steadying herself, one arm hung limply by her side.

Liu Youzhou extended his hands, gently massaging his temples, feeling that encouraging Cao Ci to explore these ruins to see what kind of woman would overlook Hua Qian was not such a good idea.

Liu Youzhou wondered if this potentially strongest young woman of the six realms needed any treasures. He had plenty to spare, and even if she didn't need them for herself, having been away from home for so long, surely there were younger family members to whom he could give gifts as New Year’s money.

---

As they moved toward Longquan County, a new governor from the vassal Huang Ting Kingdom had arrived near the dilapidated mountain. The state city god had also been appointed, and the residence hanging the "Show Water and High Wind" plaque had seen a remarkable rise in the Gu family's influence, as they became the mountain lord of the old Northern Yue of the Great Li. Meanwhile, the bride in ghostly attire returned to her home, rarely seen except for the occasional visit from the Water God of Xiuhua River.

Among the five mountain gods of the old Northern Yue of the Great Li, four had been reassigned to other peaks in Baoping Continent, leaving only the relatively unknown Gu family ghost god and three native mountain gods who had worked hard and were rewarded with promotions. Although they weren't the primary mountain deities, they had already become top-tier mountain gods in Baoping Continent, just beneath the new Five Peaks.

The Northern Yue’s Wei Bo had begun to enter seclusion.

The area around Piyun Mountain was heavily guarded. The Great Li court placed great importance on this matter, and besides the sage Ruan Qiong, they even sent Xu Ruo to protect Wei Bo as he broke through.

On the dilapidated mountain, Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafeng were playing chess.

The young attendant in green had watched the game for a while, growing increasingly drowsy, and eventually fell asleep with his head resting on the stone table, drooling all over it. Zheng Dafeng pressed down on the boy's head, twisting his wrist to wipe the drool off Chen Lingjun's face before pushing his head away from the chessboard.

Zhu Lian rubbed his chin and said slowly, "Even considering Wei Bo's breakthrough, if we hold another night tour banquet, there will still be a significant deficit."

Zheng Dafeng replied, "If it comes down to it, we could just write to our wandering mountain lord and ask him to dig into his treasures to make up for the expenses. I refuse to believe that after wandering around North Julu Continent for so long, he wouldn't have a little surplus left, especially after charming pretty women into coming to Baoping Continent."

Zhu Lian chuckled, "Brother Dafeng, your handwriting is beautiful, truly a sight for sore eyes. You should write this letter. My young master would surely feel much better seeing it."

Sitting across from them were two young girls, Zhou Mi Li in black and Chen Ru Chu in pink.

Zhou Mi Li coughed lightly.

Zheng Dafeng turned to look, feigning shock, "This big water monster, where did you come from?!"

Zhou Mi Li crossed her arms, "Coincidentally, I'm also from North Julu Continent, from a place called Dumb Lake!"

There was a loud bang from the bamboo building.

Zheng Dafeng's eyelids twitched, and he declared grandly, "Playing chess is one thing; wealth is left to fate, we shall see how it goes."

Zhou Mi Li hung her head low.

Chen Ru Chu gently offered a handful of sunflower seeds.

Zhou Mi Li shook her head, lacking an appetite.

After saying goodbye, Chen Ru Chu put away the seeds and took Zhou Mi Li with her to the bamboo building.

Estimating that in another half an hour, the noise from the second floor would cease.

It was the same every day.

They needed to boil water together first before going upstairs to carry people.

That night, Pei Qian was in the room, grinning ear to ear as she bounced around, stretching her muscles. Only after pretending to be refreshed did she walk out of the first floor, where Chen Ru Chu and Zhou Mi Li sat on two small bamboo chairs at the door.

Pei Qian reached out and snatched the walking stick from Zhou Mi Li’s hand.

Zhou Mi Li gasped and began to clap, her eyes sparkling, "Mastery achieved!"

Pei Qian nodded, "The old man on the second floor thinks so too. He said if he doesn't teach me more boxing tomorrow or the day after at the latest, he might not be able to anymore. He was quite emotional when he said it; I could see the tears in his murky old eyes filled with fear of the younger generation..."

On the second floor, Cui Cheng chuckled, "Practicing boxing late at night isn't too bad, is it?"

Pei Qian snapped, "Zhou Mi Li, what are you talking about? Training boxing isn't something to be taken lightly!"

Zhou Mi Li frowned, feeling wronged, "I was wrong."

Pei Qian secretly gave her a thumbs up. 

She was responsible. No wonder she was the right protector of the family’s fortune shop, loyal and steadfast. That left protector, always jumping around, was truly infuriating.

Cui Cheng said, "Why don't you go and help Cen Yanji with some punches?"

Pei Qian replied, "Oh, how much effort should I put in?"

Cui Cheng said, "Go with your mood."

Pei Qian thought for a moment, furrowing her brows, seriously considering this question. This old man was truly cunning; feeding punches was just a ploy to get Cen Yanji to hit her.

Cui Cheng added, "No matter your mood, if you don't move far away, I guarantee my mood won't be too good."

Pei Qian sighed, made a face at the second floor, and after a silent display of gestures, she tossed the walking stick back to Zhou Mi Li. 

Zhou Mi Li held one hand behind her back and gently clenched her fist, twisting her ankle. With a loud bang, dust flew up from the ground, and her figure vanished like smoke.

Cen Yanji was practicing her punches on the steps of the dilapidated mountain. Suddenly, she felt a tightness in her heart and turned to look.

Someone lightly tapped her forehead with a punch before swiftly passing by her, disappearing in an instant.

Cen Yanji, drenched in sweat, gazed at the spot where the figure had vanished, recognizing a familiar slender silhouette. 

She stood on a slender branch high in a pine tree, one foot on her own instep. 

Cen Yanji knew Pei Qian had been practicing on the second floor recently. But this little girl, how long had she been training?

Pei Qian, with a serious expression, said, "Sister Cen, I was just greeting you. Next, I'll help you practice your punches, but you must not hit me too hard. You're older, have practiced longer, and are taller; you should go easy on me."

Cen Yanji took a deep breath, assuming a boxing stance, and said solemnly, "Please!"

She felt as if she was facing a formidable enemy.

Pei Qian felt a little flustered; what was this? Just a sparring session, mimicking the big white goose, doing a little acting would suffice, right?

Pei Qian hesitated for a moment, quickly taking out a talisman and sticking it to her forehead. 

She needed to bolster her courage. It seemed she had to be serious, or else how would she handle being knocked half to death by Cen Yanji?

Pei Qian knew very well that this sister practiced diligently every day, tirelessly going back and forth on the mountain, and the old chef always said that this was the resilience a practitioner should have.

Pei Qian pointed her toes.

The branch beneath her bent into a massive arc but did not break. As soon as Pei Qian's momentum ran out, the branch suddenly recoiled, and she vanished into thin air.

Cen Yanji, momentarily stunned, was suddenly struck in the back with a punch, sending her tumbling down the mountain.

In the air, an elbow struck her back, and Cen Yanji crashed onto the steps, her body bouncing heavily before her eyes rolled back, and she fainted.

Pei Qian landed softly, squatting to one side, drenched in sweat, wiping her face hard. What just happened?

Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafeng stood on the steps, exchanging glances.

Pei Qian quickly adjusted the talisman on her forehead and discreetly nudged Cen Yanji while turning to shout, "By the heavens! It’s really not my fault; Cen Yanji just fainted on her own! I couldn't hold her up!"

On a ferry passing through Cloud City, soon to arrive at Dragon Palace Cave, Chen Ping'an, dressed in a blue shirt, with the sword fairy on his back and a crossbody bag slung over his shoulder, leaned against the railing.

In no time, he would reach two hundred thousand punches.

He just wondered how Pei Qian was doing at the academy, if she was helping with the business, whether it would delay her copying, and how she was getting along with the water monster from Dumb Lake.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 650: What to Do When There Are Matters

As the ferry glided along, it encountered all sorts of peculiar sights.

A group of women in colorful garments swung joyfully beneath the clouds, their laughter attracting loud shouts from many male cultivators aboard the ferry. Given that this fleeting encounter meant they would never meet again in this lifetime, their words became increasingly bold and unrestrained.

Suddenly, a massive dragon head slowly emerged from the misty clouds, causing many cultivators on the ferry to freeze in shock. It wasn’t a genuine dragon but rather a mystical entity, which gently bumped its head against the stern of the ferry, sending it speeding away like an arrow.

Chen Ping'an noted this scene in his mind. Upon returning to his cabin, he continued with a common task.

After arriving at Tongyezhou from the Upside-down Mountain, Chen Ping'an parted ways with Lu Tai. Accidentally entering the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, he left that Daoist temple with Pei Qian and the others. Chen Ping'an began to write about his experiences in the mountains and rivers. Using his memory—from leaving the Upside-down Mountain, meeting Lu Tai, reaching Tongyezhou, walking through the Fuqi Sect's Heaven-shouting Street—he wrote all the way to the present, where he witnessed the cloud dragon pushing the ferry in North Julu Province.

On the table lay two stacks of paper.

Chen Ping'an had divided them into a draft and a fair copy. The draft was messy and revised multiple times, akin to a letter that was never sent; it became quite lengthy as he wrote. 

The fair copy, on the other hand, was neat and orderly, resembling an assignment submitted by a student to their teacher.

Sometimes, when there was truly nothing of interest to write about for an extended period, he would either refrain from writing or occasionally jot down, "Nothing happened today, all is well."

In the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, birds competed to fly, embroiled in a siege, throwing punches and swords at the local top cultivator. At an inn on the border of the Great Spring Dynasty, he met a gentleman who could compose humorous poetry. During his travels, he encountered the temperamental Water Goddess of the River, visited the Biyou Palace, and exchanged pleasantries with the Water Goddess who admired the old gentleman's learning. He stayed at a dusty shop in Old Dragon City, accompanied by the increasingly sensible black charcoal girl, and headed southeast to the Qingluan Kingdom on the fifth day of the fifth month, receiving his first-ever birthday gift…

The only time he didn’t write anything was during his years as a steward at Shujian Lake.

In the end, returning to his hometown of Mud Bottle Alley, while keeping vigil alone in his ancestral home, Chen Ping'an reflected deeply and simply wrote down one sentence:

"These years have been somewhat difficult, but they’ve passed, and it seems it’s not so bad after all."

Chen Ping'an finished one piece and copied another. The two stacked piles of paper on the table were both neatly written in small, regular script. In the eyes of an expert, his writing was likely still quite rough; regardless of the content, it was over three hundred thousand words, verbose and rigorous, orderly in presentation.

He put away his brush and ink, extended both hands to gently press down on the two books that seemed yet to be bound, smoothing and flattening them.

With no worries for the time being, he allowed his thoughts to wander far and wide. Once he returned to his senses, Chen Ping'an stored the two stacks of paper in a small space and began practicing his punches, still focusing on the three unifications.

Now, the martial artist's practice of punches and the cultivation of Qi were roughly split in half, during which drawing talismans became his greatest pastime.

After purchasing two editions of the mountain and water reports, he continued his journey without incident until he reached the ferry terminal of Longgong Cave Heaven.

Longgong Cave Heaven, like his hometown of Lizhu Cave Heaven, was one of the Thirty-six Small Caves. It was the ancestral property of the Water Dragon Sect, first discovered and occupied by its founding ancestor. However, after two significant upheavals, resulting from both external threats and internal strife, the Water Dragon Sect allied with the Da Yuan Dynasty's Chong Xuan Division and the Floating Water Sword Lake, finally managing to secure a stable income.

The Water Dragon Sect is an ancient sect in North Julu Province, boasting a long history and numerous tales. Compared to the Water Dragon Sect, the Chong Xuan Division and the Floating Water Sword Lake are relatively new forces, yet their current influence far surpasses that of the Water Dragon Sect.

Due to its proximity to water, the Water Dragon Sect had established mountain and water prohibitions. Passengers on the ferry could not see the outline of the Water Dragon Sect's celestial palace; they only beheld the fog-covered area for a hundred miles. It wasn't until the ferry passed through the dense misty formation, rich in humidity throughout the year, and slowly descended to dock at the terminal that they finally caught sight of the Water Dragon Sect's sprawling, majestic buildings.

Chen Ping'an noticed it was his first time taking a ferry in North Julu Province. Upon docking, all the passengers obediently disembarked.

Thinking of the tyrannical behavior of the Lu family emperors in the Da Yuan Dynasty, the stories surrounding the Yang family of the Chong Xuan Division's Yunxiao Palace, and his firsthand experience with the female sword cultivator Li Cai from Floating Water Sword Lake, he felt little surprise.

At Muni Ferry, there were over a thousand celestial orange trees, all personally planted by the founding ancestor of the Water Dragon Sect, who, upon his death, left behind a saying: "A life of mediocrity, only the orange trees remain as a gift to my disciples."

Dressed in a green robe and carrying the sword of a celestial swordsman, Chen Ping'an, with a sword-raising gourd hanging at his waist and a green bamboo walking staff in hand, walked slowly through the bustling ferry terminal adorned with a grand archway. The archway bore the calligraphy of a certain sage from the Central Plains, inscribed with "Underwater Cave Heaven." The great river flowed through this place, with a width reaching three hundred miles. Longgong Cave Heaven lay beneath the surface, similar to the Dragon Palace in Cangjun Lake, but without the need for cultivators to avoid the water; the Water Dragon Sect had invested considerable manpower and resources to construct an underwater bridge for tourists to explore Longgong Cave Heaven. Of course, a toll was required—ten Snowflake Coins to cross, and if they wished to enter the legendary ancient cave where a thousand dragons once coiled, sent forth by decree to control the clouds and rain, an additional Small Heat Coin was needed.

It was clearly a rip-off.

As Chen Ping'an thought of the hundred-eyed gluttonous legal robe he had picked up from Yang Ningxing of Yunxiao Palace, he felt that this celestial money was not unbearable.

At the Bone Marsh Ghostly Valley, Yang Ningxing of Yunxiao Palace, the "Little Heavenly Lord."

At the border of Wuling Kingdom, Sui Jingcheng, the direct disciple of Li Cai from Floating Water Sword Lake.

The ruins of the celestial palace, Bai Bi, the direct disciple of the ancestral hall of the Water Dragon Sect beside Young Marquis Zhan Qing.

It seemed that on the path of cultivation, those relational threads resembled a tangled mess, where every knot represented an encounter, giving one the illusion that the world was rather small.

Muni Ferry was bustling, so noisy that it didn’t seem like a celestial ferry terminal, but rather like a busy street in a worldly city.

This was especially true as the upcoming dates of the tenth and fifteenth of the tenth month were two crucial days, both below the mountain and above it.

One was one of the three great ghost festivals, and the other was the Water Officer's Day of Relief.

The Water Dragon Sect would hold two sacrificial ceremonies at the publicly accessible Longgong Cave Heaven, traditional rituals highly regarded. Depending on the year, the Water Dragon Sect’s cultivators either built Gold, Jade, or Yellow Altar venues to help beings pray for blessings and dispel disasters. Particularly for the second ceremony, which celebrated the Water Officer's birthday, it was a date the Water Dragon Sect valued most due to the ancient deity's dominion over many water-related deities.

Aside from the imposing archway, Chen Ping'an noticed that the style of this place was somewhat similar to the ruins of the celestial palace. Behind the archway stood dozens of stone tablets. Was this a common practice for hydrophilic areas near the great river? Chen Ping'an looked over one by one, and there were not a few who made similar choices. Many scholars in Confucian robes, presumably from academies, were engrossed in copying the inscriptions beside the stone tablets. Chen Ping'an carefully read the "Record of the Construction of the Stone Bridge by the Worthies" from the Great Peace Period and the "Stele of Water Gate's Offering" written by the local sage of North Julu Province, as these two inscriptions detailed the construction of the underwater stone bridge and the origins and excavation of Longgong Cave Heaven.

The line was as long as a dragon, and after nearly half an hour, Chen Ping'an finally saw a Water Dragon Sect cultivator responsible for collecting the toll.

After paying ten Snowflake Coins, he received a seal carved from celestial orange ancient wood, which was quite antique, with excellent seal script. The Water Dragon Sect cultivator informed him that upon reaching the other end of the bridge, he would return it to the Water Dragon Sect cultivator stationed there.

This was Chen Ping'an's first encounter with a wooden seal from a celestial sect in the mountains; the inscription read "Rest," and the edge noted "Fame and fortune are burdens, life and death are decisive."

Chen Ping'an inquired if these wooden seals could be bought or sold.

The Water Dragon Sect female cultivator smiled and explained that the bridge's orange wood seal belonged to their sect and was not for sale. Each seal had to be recorded. However, within Longgong Cave Heaven, there was a shop specifically selling various seals, not just the Water Dragon Sect's celestial orange wood seals, but all kinds of notable stone seals. Once guests entered Longgong Cave Heaven, they could certainly find something to their liking.

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to ask about the prices of wooden seals within Longgong Cave Heaven, he was met with complaints from the crowd behind him, urging him to hurry along and stop bothering the celestial maidens.

Having no choice, Chen Ping'an turned and apologized before quickly stepping aside to allow the other guests to pass. He felt a bit regretful; in celestial shops, even the smallest items were expensive, and the larger sects made it even harder to find bargains. Conversely, at smaller ferry terminals like Qingluan Square and Fengwei Ferry, there were still opportunities.

The long bridge itself had water-dispersing properties; although it was an arch bridge, this bridge into the water was inverted. It was said that the bridge's central arch was already close to the riverbed, which was undoubtedly another marvel.

Crossing the bridge felt like stepping into the great river.

The bridge was wide, bustling with traffic, even more so than the royal streets of worldly kingdoms.

It was clear that the Water Dragon Sect made a fortune just from tolls every day.

Chen Ping'an looked up and saw the water of the great river shimmering, unlike the murky water of ordinary rivers.

The bridge stretched over three hundred miles, allowing carriages and horses to be hired at both ends.

At the other end of the great river and the stone bridge, the Water Dragon Sect had a continuous expanse of residential buildings, with a master of Yu Pu at each end, habitually divided into the Southern and Northern Sects. The ancestral hall of the Water Dragon Sect was located to the north of the river, and the original site of the Water Dragon Sect's ancestral hall was one of the three ancient temples dedicated to the River God, which is why the Northern Sect disciples often held themselves in high regard, creating a vague invisible boundary between them and the Southern Sect.

Chen Ping'an could understand this; as long as it didn’t involve major moral issues, such human sentiments were inevitable. In the future, if Lu Baixiang were to branch out beyond the Fallen Mountain, he might also behave similarly. If Lu Baixiang's direct disciples were to visit the ancestral hall of the Fallen Mountain, they might feel uncomfortable as well.

How to prepare for unforeseen events truly tests the conduct of a sect.

Reading about the stories of ancient people and observing others along the way—this is probably the essence of the saying "To read thousands of books and travel thousands of miles."

Many things cannot be truly understood through mere reflection; even if one deduces some truths, they may still seem vague. As Cui Dongshan said, if one were to present good reasoning on the chaotic streets of this materialistic world, it would be easily dismissed; how could that not be regrettable?

However, some people have experienced numerous events yet failed to make sense of them, drifting along with the tide, finding solace in the chaos of life, which, while an act of resignation, remains a pity.

Chen Ping'an continued to ponder these gains and losses slowly.

No matter how extraordinary the scenery of the long bridge over the great river, after walking several dozen miles, it became ordinary.

Even the strange fish that glimmered like fireflies and the many ethereal beings under the command of the River God moved erratically around him; after seeing them too often, one would lose interest.

Chen Ping'an noticed that for the first few miles, everyone was in high spirits, looking around and calling out loudly, but gradually they quieted down, leaving only the sounds of carriages passing by.

His greatest interest lay in observing the inscriptions and texts on the wooden seals hanging at the waists of the tourists, committing them to memory.

If the celestial orange wood seals within Longgong Cave Heaven turn out to be too expensive, he could always select good wood for carving.

After walking over a hundred miles, there were actually more than ten tea houses and taverns on the bridge, somewhat resembling roadside pavilions along the mountain paths.

Chen Ping'an chose a five-story tavern, ordered a jar of the Water Dragon Sect's specialty celestial wine, some late-night snacks, and after paying extra, he secured a table by the window on the first floor, which was packed with people. As soon as he settled in, the tavern attendant quickly brought a group of guests over, smilingly asking if they could share the table. If Chen Ping'an agreed, the tavern would offer a complimentary bowl of late-night wine. 

Looking at the group—two men and one woman—who seemed not too intimidating, with the young men neither pure martial artists nor cultivators, but rather scions of wealthy families, and an old retainer with the strength of a sixth realm martial artist, Chen Ping'an accepted. The young master smiled and nodded in thanks, and Chen Ping'an raised his wine cup in return.

If he wanted a better view, it was simple—just pay more.

However, after walking over a hundred miles and seeing all the scenery beneath the great river, spending extra now would be a waste of money.

Of course, many treated celestial money as if it were nothing.

Chen Ping'an sipped his wine and quietly listened to the chatter of the other patrons.

It was hard to keep things under wraps; even though the emperor of the Da Zhan Dynasty strictly ordered not to leak the outcome of that confrontation, with so many eyes and ears around, various bits of gossip began to surface. Eventually, it appeared in the mountain and water reports. The battle between the sword cultivator Ji Yue of the Monkey Crying Mountain and the tenth realm martial artist Gu You became a hot topic at tavern tables among cultivators, escalating in intensity. Compared to the earlier news of the northern sword cultivator who fell at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the news that spread back to North Julu Province only called for sword offerings, and Ji Yue’s death and dissolution of his Dao, especially at the hands of a pure martial artist, drew no words of respect or mourning in the mountain and water reports; everyone discussed it with increasing abandon.

The tavern's reputation leaned heavily towards condemnation.

Even among sword cultivators, they praised the grandmaster Gu You, while mentioning Ji Yue only with ridicule and anger.

Gu You’s boxing skills were divine, and he had no disciples. Ji Yue, on the other hand, still had a formidable Monkey Crying Mountain, with many disciples under his wing. However, Monkey Crying Mountain was somewhat in decline, lacking a fifth realm sword cultivator to hold down the fort.

During Ji Yue's lifetime, a sword cultivator of the celestial realm sufficed.

After Ji Yue's death, his name as a sword cultivator seemed to turn into an unforgivable sin.

Someone angrily declared, "What a load of rubbish! This so-called great sword cultivator wouldn’t dare to kill demons at the Sword Qi Great Wall and ended up switching lives with a martial artist? He’s simply embarrassed us sword cultivators!"

Another person nodded in agreement, mocking, "They say Ji Yue has been in the celestial realm for only a short time, but in my opinion, he was never truly in the celestial realm; he was just a stubborn Yu Pu realm sword cultivator, likely self-proclaimed as a great sword cultivator."

Someone lamented in frustration, "Even though his opponent was one of our province's four greatest martial artists, Ji Yue still died too disgracefully—he actually let Gu You lock onto his life sword, shattering his body with one punch, his golden core and nascent soul with two, and he died after three punches. How could a dignified sword cultivator from Monkey Crying Mountain be so careless? It was a good thing he didn’t go to the Sword Qi Great Wall, or else it would have been even more humiliating, leading local sword cultivators to mistakenly think all sword cultivators from North Julu Province are just like Ji Yue—a flower pillow."

Moments later, a cultivator with ties to Monkey Crying Mountain angrily spoke up, "Everyone knows how formidable Ji the Sword Cultivator was; why wait until after his death to speak ill of him? Where were these voices before?!"

Someone exclaimed, "Well, at last, a friend from Monkey Crying Mountain has stepped forward to speak justly!"

Another person intentionally lowered their voice, smilingly remarked, "Let’s be careful; the great sword cultivator Ji Yue has many connections. If we say anything unpleasant, we might end up silenced—Monkey Crying Mountain’s rules are strict, and they strike fast, scaring one out of their wits."

Soon, others chimed in, sneering, "What? Are we only allowed to sing Ji the Great Sword Cultivator's praises? Are we not allowed to speak a word of truth?"

Chen Ping'an sipped his wine, gazing out at the flowing waters of the great river, resembling a silent, ancient elder.

Then someone stood up abruptly, "How can there be such a disgraceful sword cultivator? Do you all not think? Do you believe you could win against Gu You in a fight?"

Immediately, someone countered, slamming their wine cup down on the table, laughing, "Ha! Just because I'm not a sword cultivator, I can't have an opinion? So, in North Julu Province, aside from that small group, are we all supposed to keep our mouths shut? Is there such a thing as fairness in the world? Is there a rule that only Monkey Crying Mountain is allowed to have an opinion?"

Chen Ping'an chuckled softly.

It did seem quite reasonable.

The few cultivators defending Ji Yue and Monkey Crying Mountain felt utterly constrained.

Meanwhile, many others were thoroughly pleased, with numerous patrons loudly ordering more late-night wine, and some, after drinking good wine, tossed their unopened jars out of the tavern, lamenting that they had never met the esteemed Gu You, nor witnessed that fateful battle of the Royal Seal on the Jiang River. Even if they looked down on worldly martial artists, they ought to toast Gu You with a jar of wine.

The three at Chen Ping'an's table exchanged whispers.

The young woman quietly asked, "Wei Qi, are the cultivators from Monkey Crying Mountain truly that overbearing? Why do they provoke so much anger?"

The young man named Wei Qi shook his head, smiling, "Actually, it's not so bad. Every sword cultivator has their temper; it's just that Monkey Crying Mountain has a worse reputation compared to the Taihui Sword Sect up north."

The elder said calmly, "What’s the point of cursing Gu You? As a cultivator, to insult a great sword cultivator while revering a martial artist shows a lack of elegance."

The young woman curiously asked, "The ones cursing the loudest, do they hold grudges against Monkey Crying Mountain?"

Wei Qi shook his head and smiled, "If they truly held a grudge, they wouldn’t be so open about it upon hearing Ji Yue's death. Those who harbor resentment and voice it are rarely those with true enmity; they’re often those with half-formed relationships. These people’s words tend to sway onlookers. This is the same in the marketplaces, in official circles, and amongst wandering cultivators."

Chen Ping'an glanced at Wei Qi and the young woman, who seemed hesitant to speak, and reminded him silently, "Cultivators have keen ears, be cautious with your words."

Wei Qi smiled and nodded, raising his wine cup toward Chen Ping'an, replying with a ripple of thought, "That’s how it should be; let’s just drink and avoid discussing rights and wrongs."

Chen Ping'an was slightly surprised.

It turned out to be a Qi practitioner of no small caliber?

Previously, he hadn’t noticed.

However, Wei Qi himself was also quite taken aback, realizing that the seemingly ordinary martial artist with a sword on his back was, in fact, a Qi practitioner.

Inside the tavern hall, several like-minded strangers were delightfully cursing Monkey Crying Mountain and Ji Yue, lifting their wine cups to propose toasts to each other.

Chen Ping'an could even see the sincerity in their eyes; their faces shone with excitement while drinking, and it was not feigned—this was the most interesting part.

He held no objections towards them; in life, when things do not go as one wishes, speaking out loudly brings little true harm. After that, it's gone, and when the next lively discussion arises, it’s another round of grand declarations worthy of toasting.

Chen Ping'an was more attentive to others, who spoke with more discretion, expressing opinions without extremity, exuding a sense of understanding, more like reason.

The words of the world seemed to harbor both divine wisdom and the chaos of ghosts.

In the wilds, when great monsters were mentioned, travelers would retreat; that was fine.

Among the river's many spirits, there were numerous alluring creatures, swaying and enticing, quietly dragging people into the depths.

On the second floor, they were also casually discussing matters on the mountain. However, compared to the competitive atmosphere on the first floor, the second floor was more relaxed, with everyone engaged in their own conversations, and Chen Ping'an overheard discussions about Qi Jinglong's retreat and speculations about which three sword cultivators would inquire with the Taihui Sword Sect. They also talked about the battle at Dili Mountain involving Huang Xi and Xiu Niang, the rapidly rising Qingliang Sect, and a young female sect leader who claimed to have found a Dao partner.

On the third floor, he caught snippets of conversations about trade, with voices low but discussing profits and losses in the thousands of Snowflake Coins.

On the fourth floor, the discussions were indistinct, filled with magical prohibitions, and Chen Ping'an naturally would not pry; he could only hear as much as he could.

He vaguely heard discussions about the trends in Baopingzhou, mentioning Beiyue and Wei Ban. More discussions revolved around Aiai State and the Central Divine State, such as speculations about whether the young martial artist Cao Ci of the Da Duan Dynasty had reached the Golden Body realm by now, and at what age he might achieve the limits of martial arts.

As for the top floor, only the faint clinking of cups occasionally broke the silence.

After leisurely finishing a jar of late-night wine, Chen Ping'an stood and made his way to the counter to settle the bill before leaving the tavern alone.

During this time, he remembered to nod to the three at his table, and Wei Qi smiled back in acknowledgment, raising his wine cup slightly.

As he walked on the long bridge over the great river, a luxurious carriage suddenly caught his eye, moving grandly along the waterway, resembling a noble family's outing. An elder in purple robes with a jade belt held a jade tablet, accompanied by silver-armored divine beings wielding iron spears, and a white-clad goddess whose eyes sparkled like two radiant stars, lingering long after.

These figures were perhaps the water immortals and water spirits described in the unofficial histories, residing in the Dragon Palace, responsible for ensuring the region's weather was favorable.

The entrance to Longgong Cave Heaven lay fifty miles ahead along the bridge.

Longgong Cave Heaven is a genuine dragon palace relic.

According to the inscriptions, it was indeed once inhabited by ancient water immortals, with dragons coiling about.

Compared to the mixed descendants of dragons in Dragon Gulley from years past, this Dragon Palace resembled a mountain residence, while Dragon Gulley resembled a martial arts sect.

Chen Ping'an spotted the outline of a city gate and, as he approached, saw a gold plaque hanging that read "Jidu Summer Resort."

Beneath this largest plaque, there were layers of smaller plaques, each crafted by notable figures—some from talismanic immortals whose inscriptions had remained bright for centuries, others imbued with abundant sword intent.

Perhaps due to the need to pay a Small Heat Coin, the city gate was not as crowded as the bridgehead.

Such small cave heavens managed by sects for hundreds of years were not meant to be left for future generations, especially outsiders; even if a rare treasure were to appear, it would be swiftly claimed by the Water Dragon Sect, making it off-limits to others. Even with the Water Dragon Sect's local dominance, there were some who coveted offerings from great cultivators crossing the river, especially with the backing of Yang's thunderous magic and the flying swords from Floating Water Sword Lake, which helped keep their rivals in check.

Historically, Longgong Cave Heaven had experienced a significant theft incident, ultimately recovered through the combined efforts of three sects. The identity of the thief was unexpected yet fitting—a renowned sword cultivator who had concealed his identity among the Water Dragon Sect's miscellaneous workers for decades but still failed to succeed, having to return the stolen water treasure in the face of pursuit by three sects' ancestors; he narrowly escaped death and fled to Aiai State, becoming a servant to the God of Wealth, Liu, and has yet to dare return to North Julu Province.

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to hand over a Small Heat Coin, someone softly advised, "If you can save, then save; there's no need to pay."

Chen Ping'an turned around, pleasantly surprised, though he didn’t call out the person’s name.

Yet his eyes could not hide his joy.

It was none other than Li Liu, who should have been cultivating at Lion Peak.

During their reunion at the Daisui Academy years ago, according to Li Huai, this sister of his had become a practitioner at Lion Peak, serving the ancient immortal on the mountain by bringing him tea and water every day. As for her parents, they had opened a shop at the foot of the mountain, earning a great deal of money, and her marriage prospects had also been settled.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "What a coincidence! I was planning to walk through Jidu and then visit Lion Peak to find you all."

Li Liu gently shook her head, smiling, "Not really; I came specifically to find you."

Chen Ping'an hesitated, all his words ultimately swallowed back.

Li Liu was evidently a well-accomplished Qi practitioner, and her realm was certainly high.

However, this feeling of his flickered and vanished.

Li Liu took out an ancient-looking dragon-shaped jade plaque. The Water Dragon Sect's guard at the city gate glanced at it and immediately bowed respectfully to this unidentified young woman. Li Liu then led Chen Ping'an directly through the city gate and up a seemingly endless staircase of white jade.

For some reason, when Chen Ping'an turned back, it appeared that the city gate had been sealed off, preventing anyone from entering Longgong Cave Heaven.

Ahead, the figures were small as mustard seeds, gradually ascending.

Li Liu gently spoke, "Mr. Chen."

Chen Ping'an quickly replied, "Just call me by my name; temporarily, you can call me Chen Good Person."

Li Liu's eyes sparkled like water, smiling widely.

Chen Ping'an felt slightly shameless and thought about whether to take another alias, finally saying, "Then just call me Mr. Chen."

Li Liu nodded, and her first statement carried weight, "Mr. Chen should strive to reach the Golden Body realm soon; otherwise, there will be changes over in the Golden Armor Province."

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment and replied, "I’ll try my best."

Li Liu's next statement left Chen Ping'an's heart unsettled, "Not long ago, Zheng Dafu sent a letter to Lion Peak, and I made a trip to Fallen Mountain. The Lotus Flower Blessed Land has now been divided into four. Fallen Mountain occupies one part, and that Tongye Umbrella is the entrance. Zhu Lian and the others urgently need to upgrade the area temporarily named Lotus Flower Blessed Land into a medium blessed land; otherwise, it will fall into desolation, which requires two to three thousand Grain Rain Coins."

Chen Ping'an's expression stiffened as he carefully asked, "Grain Rain Coins?"

Li Liu nodded, "Grain Rain Coins."

Chen Ping'an sighed, "Even if I smashed my pots and sold my iron, it wouldn’t be enough."

Only then did Li Liu describe the recent developments on Zhu Lian's side.

After listening, Chen Ping'an could finally breathe a little easier.

If he could borrow money, that would at least be a skill.

Who to borrow from, how much, and how to repay; Zhu Lian already had a plan laid out. After listening carefully, Chen Ping'an had no objections. With Zhu Lian spearheading, along with Wei Ban and Zheng Dafu strategizing, there shouldn’t be any issues.

The key point was that this burden of owing two to three thousand Grain Rain Coins ultimately rested on the shoulders of this young mountain lord, and there was no escaping it.

Of course, Chen Ping'an wouldn’t run away; he had already begun acting as a steward, recalculating the wealth he had accumulated during his time in North Julu Province, starting from the scraps he had gathered to all the items he could sell, figuring out how many Grain Rain Coins he could cough up. After setting aside the portions he had already borrowed, he wondered if he could fill in the gap for Fallen Mountain. The answer was simple: he couldn’t.

When Chen Ping'an regained his focus, Li Liu had just shifted the conversation, "Actually, the earliest entrance to Lizhu Cave Heaven was quite similar to this Longgong Cave Heaven."

Chen Ping'an responded with regret, "I’ve never been there; by the time I left my hometown, Lizhu Cave Heaven had already settled down."

Li Liu laughed, "Care to sit for a while? After all, there’s no one behind us."

Without hesitation, Chen Ping'an sat down on the steps, took out his sword-raising gourd, and had a sip of wine. From now on, he could only drink glutinous rice wine.

Li Liu said, "With this jade plaque, no one from the Water Dragon Sect will use their powers to pry into our movements."

Chen Ping'an still didn’t ask much.

His impression of Li Liu was rather shallow; she was merely Li Huai’s sister and the object of admiration for Lin Shouyi and Dong Shuijing.

Until today, they hadn’t interacted at all.

Li Liu hesitated for a moment, "Mr. Chen, I have a mountain copy of 'Mirroring Flowers and Water Moon' that pertains to you, though it's not very significant. I didn’t intend to hand it over, fearing it might complicate your travels."

Chen Ping'an was puzzled, pondering for a moment before saying, "It’s fine; since it’s something that you’ll eventually find out, it’s better to plan ahead."

Li Liu then took out what looked like a copybook of sorts, suspending it in the air. She lightly pointed with her finger, causing ripples to spread, enveloping them in mist.

On the copybook, an image of a solemnly seated woman appeared.

Disguised as Shi Jiao, she was a female cultivator from a small sect in Baopingzhou.

She came from the Dao Offering Mountain in North Julu Province and was serving as a maid on the ferry that had already crashed in the territory of the Zhu Ying Dynasty.

Li Liu gazed into the distance, as if detached from the scene.

Having witnessed the joys and sorrows of the world, she felt hardly any emotion.

The last scene of 'Mirroring Flowers and Water Moon' was that of a woman who sought death, carefully retrieving a treasured silk pouch she had kept for many years. She frowned, as if trying not to cry, forcing a smile as she held the silk pouch high, gently shaking it, and softly said, "Hey, whoever you are, Qiu Shi likes you. Did you hear? Did you see? If you didn’t know, that’s fine. If you did, just knowing is enough."

Chen Ping'an sat quietly, listening to the story without missing a word.

She was Qiu Shi's sister, named Chun Shui.

Chen Ping'an recognized this at first glance.

Finally, he murmured, "Okay, I understand."

After a long silence.

Li Liu put away the copybook and tucked it into her sleeve.

Chen Ping'an set aside his sword-raising gourd, his face revealing no signs of sorrow or anger.

Li Liu didn’t find this strange.

She simply stated something that sounded rather cold, "Given the circumstances, her actions were pointless, nothing but a quest for death."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Generally speaking, that’s the case."

Li Liu asked, "Is there an 'uncommon' perspective?"

Chen Ping'an did not provide an answer and instead said, "I plan to continue my journey and won’t visit Longgong Cave Heaven; I can’t afford anything there anyway. But will this cause you any trouble?"

Li Liu laughed, "Mr. Chen is overthinking it. In North Julu Province, I have no troubles. At least, I am safe."

Though Chen Ping'an said he would continue on, he did not rise immediately.

He recalled the couplet he intended to hang in the bamboo building at Fallen Mountain; the first line read, "In the stormy winds and rain beyond the mountain, I will draw my sword and descend."

Chen Ping'an then hung the sword he had been carrying on his back at his waist.

This would be the first time he truly wielded a sword.

Previously, he was used to just carrying it.

Li Liu asked, "Mr. Chen, are you planning to directly confront the Dao Offering Mountain, then question the Da Li Dynasty, and finally inquire of the Celestial Lord Xie Shi?"

Li Liu herself wasn’t fond of using swords; be it ancient deities or contemporary practitioners, she found them all unsatisfactory.

Chen Ping'an stood up, shaking his sword-raising gourd, and laughed, "Not at all, my skills aren’t sufficient; I’ll just rely on wine to bolster my courage."

Li Liu nodded with a smile, remaining seated as she watched the young man in the green robe, armed with a sword, slowly descend the steps.

What to do when there are matters?

Draw the sword and descend the mountain.

And if the world’s issues surpass one’s abilities, what then?

One can only keep the answers in their heart and sheathed.
