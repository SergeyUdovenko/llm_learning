 ### Chapter 444: Some Reunions Are the Worst (Part 2)

Gu Can's expression suddenly changed, and with a grin, he said, “That little brat Yuan Yuan, one day I’ll give him a line like this, just changing one word: ‘Do you want to die, Mom?’ So what if he has a cheap dad who's a Nascent Soul sword cultivator? If he provokes me, I’ll strip Yuan Yuan's mother right in front of that Nascent Soul sword cultivator and hang her at the bow of the ship, parading her across all the islands in Shujian Lake.”

Lu Caisang looked puzzled.

Gu Can lifted the curtain again and absentmindedly said, “It’s a local dialect, you wouldn’t understand.”

————

At the top of the high building in Chishui City, Cui Dongshan was still surrounded by a golden lightning pool.

He sighed.

Cui Chan leaned slightly forward, observing the two scrolls on the ground, and smiled, “Are you feeling disappointed? That last flicker of hope in your heart has vanished, hasn’t it? This mindset is dangerous; putting your hope in others is never wise.”

Cui Chan seemed to know that Cui Dongshan wouldn’t respond, so he continued, “This is two deadlocks intertwined, a principle that Chen Ping’an has slowly figured out, and the evil that Gu Can has naturally produced. Do you really believe that the solution lies with Gu Can? You think that Chen Ping’an can appeal to this kid's emotions and reason with him to make him see the light? Don’t even mention how difficult that reasoning is; even if the affection is deep, Gu Can won't change his nature. That’s just who Gu Can is. Mud Bottle Alley is so small; can I not see that this kid with an iron will, who even Liu Zhimo can’t lift, is Gu Can?”

“Are you underestimating yourself, Cui Dongshan? You can’t even grasp Gu Can’s true nature, yet you dare to set this trap? For people like us, making a mistake once is already too many. But I can’t blame you; when one reaches the end of their rope, people like to grasp at straws, it’s human nature. In fact, back in the day, we were still one person; I saw it, and you naturally did too. It’s just that you’re now in a state of confusion.”

Cui Chan pointed at the figure of Chen Ping’an subtly following a carriage in the scroll, “Do you know where your greater mistake lies?”

Cui Chan answered his own question, “Back when Qi Jingchun completely tore apart his relationship with us in that old house in the small town, he said that within a hundred years, if we dared to plot against Chen Ping’an again, our realms would fall continuously. This isn’t Qi Jingchun just trying to scare us; you and I both know this. However, after we parted ways, you ultimately retained the naïve nature of youth, refusing to believe in evil, right? Then at the bottom of that well in the inn, you almost killed Chen Ping’an with a strand of sword energy. After that, you walked into another extreme, beginning to firmly believe his words. This is the last straw you’re clutching onto, floating in the chaotic lake of your heart.”

Cui Dongshan’s lips twitched.

Cui Chan maintained a calm demeanor, gazing at the scrolls, and muttered to himself, “The lingering ghost of Qi Jingchun really is dead beyond any hope of revival. So let’s consider this matter more cautiously; suppose Qi Jingchun’s chess skills are unparalleled and he foresaw this calamity at Shujian Lake. Before he died, he might have used some secret technique to place part of his soul somewhere in Shujian Lake. But have you ever thought about what kind of scholar Qi Jingchun was? He would rather Zhao Yao, whom he held in high hopes, not inherit his literary legacy but instead study and travel safely. Do you think that the incomplete ‘Qi Jingchun’ hidden in some corner would hope for anything other than for Chen Ping’an to live on, carefree and stable, wishing that he would not have to bear so many burdens on his shoulders? Even you feel sorry for your new teacher; do you think Qi Jingchun wouldn’t feel the same?”

Cui Chan smiled, “Of course, I won’t deny that even if Qi Jingchun’s soul was split into three, I would still be somewhat wary of him. Nowadays, if he dares to show himself, if I catch a hint of him, I won’t give him a chance to speak, not a single word.”

Cui Dongshan turned his head, staring blankly at Cui Chan, this older version of himself who had matured with age. “Why do you think I should become you now?”

Cui Chan smiled slightly, pointing to the carriage, “This is something Chen Ping’an will likely say to Gu Can after their meeting: ‘Why did you have to become the person you hated the most back then?’”

Cui Chan didn’t even look at Cui Dongshan or the swaying golden lightning pool, slowly saying, “Let’s not talk about the fact that you can’t kill me at all; even if you did, this deadlock would remain a deadlock, just like the grand currents of the world, unchangeable. So you might as well sit tight; while I still have some time before returning to the Great Li, many questions you, Cui Dongshan, don’t understand can still be asked of me, Cui Chan.”

Once Cui Chan stopped speaking, the room fell into an eerie silence.

He seemed to recall an amusing incident and asked with a smile, “If you don’t ask, then I’ll ask you. If Gu Can were to respond to Chen Ping’an’s question like this, how would Chen Ping’an feel? For example… hmm, Gu Can might resolutely say to him, ‘I think I’m not in the wrong; if you have the ability, come kill me.’ Or perhaps… ‘Where were you, Chen Ping’an, when my mother and I were bullied by those bad people from Shujian Lake?’”

Cui Dongshan’s vision blurred as he stared blankly at the scholarly elder, this version of himself who had confidently walked to where he was today.

Cui Chan smiled and continued, “In fact, everyone feels lonely as they grow up, whether they study or not. Some smarter ones can sense, in the vast universe, that at certain moments, things are not as quiet as they seem. Some self-reflection can yield vague responses of guilt and regret. Do you know what that’s called? You don’t, because this is something I, Cui Chan, have only recently come to understand. You, Cui Dongshan, are rowing against the current, retreating time and again; I won’t say it, and you won’t understand, but that’s called the conscience of one’s heart. However, this feeling will never make one’s life better; it will only make it more painful, whether you’re a good person or a bad person.”

Cui Chan continued, “By the way, during the time you squandered at the Great Sui Academy, I shared the ideas we developed back in the day with the Old Divine Monarch, helping him untangle a small knot in his heart. Think about it, for someone like the Old Divine Monarch, a single emotional hurdle could take nearly ten thousand years to overcome. How long do you think it would take for Chen Ping’an? Furthermore, if I were Cui Chan, I wouldn’t cry just because of a casual remark from Chen Ping’an saying ‘think about it again’—after all, that’s a completely different answer than the one from the old scholar. Just like how you look right now.”

Cui Dongshan raised his arm across his face.

Cui Chan chuckled, “You’ve lost even the spirit to call me an old bastard, huh? Looks like your heart is truly wounded; you’re almost as pitiful as Chen Ping’an. But don’t worry, next, the teacher will be even more pitiful and heartbroken than the student.”

Cui Dongshan leaned back, tears and snot running down his face, sobbing softly.

Cui Chan’s expression remained impassive as he remarked, “If I remember correctly, this kind of despairing state of mind first occurred a long time ago, back in our hometown in that attic where grandpa pulled up the stairs. You were roughly the same age as you are now, sulking after tearing up a book that grandpa cherished most, using it for… well, you know, and throwing it down. When grandpa saw those crumpled papers, he didn’t get angry; he didn’t even say anything, didn’t scold you; he just set up the ladder again and walked away.”

Cui Chan laughed, “What I told the Old Divine Monarch was only half the truth; it’s the powerful aspect hidden within the weakness of human nature. Those concepts later interpreted as ‘empathy,’ ‘synesthesia,’ and ‘compassion’ allow a person, regardless of how strong they are or how promising their future is, to do things that those aloof and indifferent deities could never imagine. They would generously give their lives for others, feel joy and sorrow with the emotions of others, and be willing to sacrifice themselves for someone they’ve known for only a short while. A single spark of human kindness can ignite a dazzling brilliance, leading one to sing their own elegy, willingly offering their body to help others climb higher, to that mountaintop, to the visible celestial palace, to tear it down! To smash those deities who look down on mortals, treating the fate of humanity as mere offerings!”

Cui Chan chuckled again, “But that’s only half of it. The other half of human nature is that a person inherently knows that to survive, they can resort to any means. ‘I,’ no matter how humble, am unique in this world, and thus countless ‘I’s want to live, to live longer, to live better. We don’t realize that we already know that ‘one’; driven by the instincts fostered by the deities, we strive for more. Since there is only one ‘one,’ we can only seize it from others, making our own ‘one’ larger and more abundant. This pursuit is endless.”

Cui Chan pointed at Chen Ping’an and the carriage, “Gu Can may not understand Chen Ping’an’s struggles, just like Chen Ping’an may not have understood Qi Jingchun’s thoughts back then.”

Cui Chan withdrew his hand and asked with a smile, “So, do you guess that during that last time Qi Jingchun held an umbrella for Chen Ping’an, walking along the street outside Yang’s Medicine Shop, he had already given Chen Ping’an a reason to not feel guilty in the future? However, what I find most worth pondering is whether that kid from Mud Bottle Alley had already guessed that he was the key piece that caused Qi Jingchun’s demise?”

Cui Chan turned his head and shook it with a smile.

Cui Dongshan had already shut off all sensory perceptions.

Cui Chan continued to observe the two scrolls, “Old Scholar, if you see this, what would you say? Hmm, perhaps you’d stroke your beard and say, ‘Not very kind, indeed.’”

Cui Chan suddenly scoffed, “In such a vast Tongye Continent, how is it that only one Xun Yuan isn’t blind? It’s truly incredible.”

Cui Dongshan lay there stiffly, like a corpse.

Cui Chan turned and asked, “What did you write in that little pouch? That’s the only thing I’m curious about. Don’t play dead; I know that even if you’ve sealed off the Eternal Life Bridge, you can still guess my thoughts. You, Cui Dongshan, still possess some cleverness.”

Cui Dongshan remained motionless, continuing to pretend to be dead.

————

In the most crowded street of Chishui City, in a place where an assassination should never have occurred, a shocking ambush unfolded.

A sword cultivator of the Eighth Realm from Zhu Ying Dynasty, a martial artist from the Eighth Realm in the Journeying Stage, and a Golden Core formation master who had set up formations.

A foolproof arrangement.

Yet the outcome left the onlookers disappointed.

First, the assassination was too sudden, and second, the conclusion came too quickly.

The carriage of the second vehicle exploded apart, revealing a woman in a wide-brimmed hat—a “loose woman.”

She allowed the Eighth Realm sword cultivator’s life sword to pierce her heart, punching the approaching Journeying Stage martial artist dead, her hand still clutching a heart she had ripped from her own chest. She then soared away, opened her mouth wide, and swallowed it down, before chasing after the sword cultivator, delivering a punch to his back that shattered his military-grade Golden Crow armor. Then, with a grab, she dug out another heart, hovering in the wind, not even glancing at the corpse that fell to the ground, letting the cultivator’s life essence carry that Golden Core far away.

This had been agreed upon with her master beforehand; she would finish the job in one breath and then there would be no more fun.

And this “loose woman” was none other than that little “mud eel.”

She had quietly entered the Nascent Soul realm.

As a descendant of the dragon species in the Nascent Soul realm, her battle prowess equated to that of a Ninth Realm martial artist combined with a Nascent Soul cultivator.

What’s more, she wasn’t an ordinary dragon descendant; she was one of the last five true dragon heirs left in the world.

She returned to the first carriage, still savoring the taste of the heart of the Eighth Realm sword cultivator, which was absolutely delightful. It was hard to come by such a delicious feast in Shujian Lake.

Gu Can, dressed in a dark blue python robe, jumped down from the carriage, with Lu Caisang closely following behind.

Gu Can walked up to her, extended a finger, wiped her mouth, and scolded, “Little mud eel, how many times have I told you? No more eating like that! Do you want to eat at the same table with me and my mother in the future or not?!”

She smiled shyly, turned her head, somewhat embarrassed.

This scene sent chills down Lu Caisang's spine.

Gu Can swaggered over to the Golden Core formation master, who was standing on the street, too terrified to move. This Earth Immortal was surrounded by a tide of fleeing people.

It wasn’t that the formation master lacked the mental resilience to move; it was that she was being fixedly stared down by that beast. If she dared to act, she would die.

Gu Can clasped his hands in his sleeves, circled around the ordinary-looking woman who was a Golden Core cultivator, and finally stood in front of her, sighing, “What a pity, Auntie, you’re just too ugly; otherwise, you wouldn’t have to die.”

The woman collapsed to her knees, “Gu Can, please spare me! From now on, I can serve you!”

Gu Can smiled but didn’t reply, seemingly weighing the pros and cons.

The little mud eel, now devoid of her hat but still wearing the loose woman’s attire, burped and quickly covered her mouth.

Gu Can turned his head and glared at her.

Then he smiled at Lu Caisang, “So, how was it? You didn’t follow me around for nothing, did you?”

Lu Caisang nodded, her smile radiant.

Otherwise, Gu Can wouldn’t have been the biggest menace in Shujian Lake before.

Gu Can continued to twist his neck, laughing, “Lu Caisang, why don’t you tell this auntie about the rules I laid down for all of Shujian Lake?”

In the early years on Qingxia Island, many assassinations and sneak attacks occurred. For some reason, Gu Can managed to persuade the furious River Cutting True Monarch Liu Zhimo not to follow the clues to uncover the mastermind behind those assassins.

However, whether it was the enemies of Shujian Lake or those wild cultivators who simply disliked Gu Can’s style and hired assassins, none of them were fools; they wouldn’t waste money or risk their lives by sending people to Qingxia Island just to die for free.

Lu Caisang glanced at the woman with a sidelong glance, smiling, “Outside Qingxia Island, in all assassinations and provocations, the first strike is on the noble guest, and only one person is to be killed. The second time, aside from the one who made the first move, another close relative must be sacrificed, in pairs. The third time, if someone has a family, then the whole family is killed; if there are no relatives, then the whole family of the mastermind behind the scenes is killed. If the mastermind is also a lonely person, then the closest friends will be killed instead. In short, the path to the Underworld cannot be too lonely.”

Gu Can nodded, turned back, and looked at the woman’s face filled with fear and despair, extending a hand with three fingers raised, “If you die for nothing, why bother? Cultivators take their time with revenge; a hundred years is not too late. But you are right, a hundred years later, how could you dare to provoke misfortune? You three are just too useless. Remember last year on Qingxia Island, there was an assassin who was truly impressive; his skills weren’t high, but his idea was brilliant. He actually squatted in a toilet and came at me with a sword. Truly a genius! If it weren’t for the little mud eel’s quick action, I would have felt bad about killing him!”

Gu Can kept one hand in his sleeve and extended three fingers with the other, “In your case, outside Qingxia Island, there have already been three incidents. Last time I told that guy, as a family, we should be together, regardless of where we are; we should always be united. The first time, whoever kills me, I kill them back; the second, a close relative gets killed; the third, the whole family gets wiped out. Now, what comes next? What did we say?”

The little mud eel swallowed hard.

“Extermination of the nine clans.”

Gu Can suddenly realized, “Right, that’s the saying.”

Gu Can retracted his fingers, bowed slightly, and spoke softly to the woman, as she was usually not very tall, so he didn’t have to speak with effort.

Gu Can chuckled quietly, “You’re about to face extermination of the nine clans. Actually, don’t be afraid; it’s a big reunion. Even during festivals, you can’t gather together.”

Just then, from under the eaves of a nearby building, a middle-aged man carrying a sword and a wine gourd stepped out.

He walked straight towards Gu Can.

Lu Caisang turned around, squinting her eyes, filled with murderous intent.

Gu Can also turned around, smiling, “Don’t worry, let him come.”

Lu Caisang hesitated for a moment but still made way.

The middle-aged man named Chen walked directly to the “young” man in the python robe.

The little mud eel, now transformed into human form, suddenly took a step back.

Gu Can furrowed his brow slightly, sensing something, but before he could react, the man slapped him across the face.

“Say that again?” the man demanded.

Lu Caisang’s mouth dropped open.

Almost everyone on the street was in shock.

The man raised his hand again and delivered another fierce slap to Gu Can’s face, his voice trembling with anger, “Gu Can! Say that again!”

Gu Can turned his head to spit out a mouthful of blood, tilting his head, his swollen cheek flushed, yet his eyes were full of laughter, “Haha, Chen Ping’an! You’ve come!”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 445: Another Bowl of Rice on the Table (Part One)

Dressed in a dark teal python robe, Gu Can looked magnificent. This robe was crafted from the skin he shed upon entering the Nascent Soul stage, a masterpiece secretly made by a renowned artisan hired at great expense by the Celestial River True Monarch.

No longer did Gu Can stand with his hands tucked in his sleeves, shrouded in an air of mystery that left countless wild cultivators at Booklet Lake feeling awed. He opened his arms and jumped in place, exclaiming, “Chen Ping'an, you’ve grown so tall! I thought I’d be able to match your height when we met!”

However, the middle-aged man remained silent.

The crowd in Chishui City, drawn in by the spectacle, held their breath. Even Lü Caisang, who usually matched Gu Can’s bravado, felt inexplicably uneasy.

Gu Can scratched his head, unsure of what to say next.

Finally, Chen Ping'an broke the silence, his voice raspy, “How’s your aunt?”

Gu Can nodded vigorously, “She’s good!”

Chen Ping'an continued, “I’d like to see her. Is that alright?”

Gu Can looked a bit hurt. “What’s there to ask about? My mother talks about you all the time! Chen Ping'an, why do you have to be so formal?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I’ll wait for you at the dock. You finish your meal with your friends first, and then take me to Qingxia Island.”

Gu Can laughed heartily, “Why bother with them? Just leave them be! Come on, let’s go to Qingxia Island! My mother and I have moved into a big mansion, way more lavish than that shabby place in Mud Bottle Alley. You wouldn’t believe how wide the road is; it’s grand, right?”

Chen Ping'an asked, “Aren’t you going to say goodbye to Fan Yan and Yuan Yuan?”

Gu Can shook his head, “No need. Those drinking buddies are nothing to worry about.”

Chen Ping'an said nothing more, merely glancing at Gu Can’s companion, a humanoid version of the “little mudfish” he had once caught in a field.

Now, this creature appeared as an ordinary young woman, but upon closer inspection, her golden, slit-pupil eyes hinted at her true nature, recognizable to any cultivator.

When Chen Ping'an looked at her, one of the five dragon descendants from the Lijuzhou cave, who had previously dismissed Liu Zhimiao, this time she didn’t retreat as she had before. Yet, she lowered her gaze, seemingly unable to meet Chen Ping'an’s eyes.

Not saying a word, Chen Ping'an turned and walked toward the dock.

Gu Can hurried after him, casting a glance at his figure before deciding to send Lü Caisang to inform Fan Yan and the others, asking the little mudfish to take along the woman who was a Golden Core Earth Immortal assassin.

Lü Caisang hesitated, but Gu Can’s frosty glare made her turn and leave.

With that, Gu Can swaggered after Chen Ping'an, feeling quite pleased as the sleeves of his python robe billowed in the wind.

If it hadn’t been for Chen Ping'an’s presence, the woman would have been dead today. The threat of extermination for her clan was no joke; they would have gathered in the underworld, united as one.

As Chen Ping'an passed by a carriage, he didn’t stop. Gu Can shouted, “Hey, aren’t you taking a carriage?”

Chen Ping'an didn’t slow down or turn back. “I have my own legs, and I can keep up with the carriage.”

Gu Can then instructed the little mudfish to escort the assassin to the carriage while he followed Chen Ping'an to the boat heading to Qingxia Island.

Along the way, Gu Can didn’t ask Chen Ping'an why he had slapped him earlier, nor did he boast about his power at Booklet Lake. Instead, he shared casual stories from Longquan County.

However, as they approached Booklet Lake, Gu Can’s spirits sank.

Just as he had ignored his drinking companions, Chen Ping'an had not uttered a single word during the entire journey. What puzzled Gu Can most was that Chen Ping'an didn’t seem to be seething with rage; rather, he appeared distracted, absorbed in his own thoughts. This slightly eased Gu Can’s tension.

What Gu Can feared most was that Chen Ping'an might choose to ignore him entirely after their encounter, slapping him twice before walking away without a second thought, leaving them as strangers forever.

Upon boarding the ship, the little mudfish brought the Golden Core woman along behind them. Gu Can cautiously asked, “Chen Ping'an, how about I let that assassin go? I’m in a good mood today; it wouldn’t hurt to set her free.”

Chen Ping'an paused for a moment but continued onward without stopping.

Gu Can sensed the anger and disappointment radiating from him.

Yet, Gu Can couldn’t understand why he had said such things or acted this way... He was wrong in Chen Ping'an’s eyes as well.

With a sigh, Gu Can turned around, hands tucked into his sleeves, and glanced coldly at the woman who had attempted to kill him. 

It was all her fault for appearing out of nowhere to assassinate him, causing Chen Ping'an to become angry; she truly deserved a death sentence, her entire clan wiped out!

When they reached the bow of the ship, Chen Ping'an stood alone, gazing out at the distant lake.

Gu Can felt both wronged and desperate to be closer to Chen Ping'an, so he stood a few steps behind him, lacking the courage to stand side by side.

At that moment, the assassin woman, sensing a glimmer of hope, suddenly fell to her knees and bowed her head vigorously towards Chen Ping'an. “Please, let me go! I know you’re a good person, a compassionate living Buddha! Please, just tell Gu Can to spare me this time. If you don’t kill me, I promise to build a shrine for you and honor you every day, even if I have to become Gu Can’s servant!”

The little mudfish twitched its fingers.

Gu Can couldn’t help but laugh, turning to the little mudfish and shaking his head, allowing the assassin to continue begging for mercy as the ship’s deck echoed with the sound of her head hitting the wooden planks.

Chen Ping'an, trembling, took a swig from his sword gourd before turning around, but instead of looking at the woman calling him a good person and living Buddha, he focused on Gu Can. “Why not just kill her?”

Gu Can replied earnestly, “Killing her alone won’t solve anything. There are too many people looking for death at Booklet Lake. You might not know this, but in our lawless Booklet Lake, if someone kills me, I’ll just kill them in return. That would be the height of compassion, and everyone would just laugh at us.”

Gu Can seemed worried that Chen Ping'an wouldn’t believe him, so he turned to the little mudfish, “Isn’t that right? I’m not lying to Chen Ping'an, am I?”

The little mudfish, the most audacious of them all at Booklet Lake, nodded timidly.

The woman, having become a Golden Core Earth Immortal and daring to attempt to assassinate Gu Can, was certainly not foolish. She quickly grasped the implication of her lifeline: could she be killed? As the realization hit her, she felt as if she had plunged into an icy abyss, her gaze wavering as she looked down.

Chen Ping'an asked, “If I can promise that if I kill you, all related to you will be spared, what would you do?”

The woman raised her head, her eyes brimming with tears. “I know you’re a good person. Why can’t you let me go? I realize my mistake; I shouldn’t have tried to kill Gu Can. I promise that whenever I see him in the future, I will take a detour. Please, save me! Saving a life is worth a mountain of merit! I’ll worship you every day!”

Chen Ping'an slowly said, “If you had succeeded in your assassination today, and Gu Can was kneeling, begging you to spare him and his mother, would you agree?”

“Just answer me honestly,” he added.

The woman wiped her tears, “Even if I was willing to let Gu Can go, that sword cultivator from the Zhu Ying Dynasty would definitely strike. But if Gu Can begs me, I will spare his mother. I will protect that innocent woman; I won’t let her be bullied.”

Gu Can’s smile was radiant.

He knew the woman was just spouting nonsense to save her life; such empty promises meant nothing to him. He didn’t care if Chen Ping'an agreed to let a couple of ants go, even if they were Gold Core Earth Immortals. To him, her life and that of her clan were worthless. The promises and intentions they held meant nothing in the grand scheme. This detour to the banquet was merely for fun, to toy with those who thought they held the upper hand.

Chen Ping'an replied to Gu Can, “You can kill her in the streets; I don’t think that’s wrong. Killing her here is fine, and you can wait to kill her on Qingxia Island; that’s also an option.”

Gu Can was taken aback.

Chen Ping'an continued, “What did you call her in the street?”

Gu Can thought for a moment, “Aunt.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “What do I call your mother?”

Gu Can mumbled, “Also ‘Aunt.’”

Chen Ping'an murmured, “A family should be whole and united; a family should be together.”

At that, Gu Can’s eyes turned red, and he lowered his head. “What do you want me to do? Kill her or let her go? Just tell me, Chen Ping'an—what do I need to do for you not to be angry with me anymore? Just tell me, and I’ll do it.”

Chen Ping'an turned away, “Suit yourself. I’ll visit your aunt on Qingxia Island, and I might just leave after talking.”

Chen Ping'an fell silent once more.

Gu Can gritted his teeth, his eyes moist, fists clenched tightly.

Gu Can and the little mudfish shared a mutual understanding; without needing any words, the little mudfish grabbed the Golden Core Earth Immortal and, like a chick, took her to a hidden cabin on the ship for confinement.

Chen Ping'an remained standing at the bow.

Gu Can went to the top deck during the journey, feeling agitated, and smashed every cup on the table. The timid maidens, who usually saw him smiling, were terrified, not understanding why their usually cheerful master was so irritable today.

The little mudfish stood nearby, feeling equally frustrated.

Gu Can looked up at the little mudfish and smiled, “Don’t worry, little mudfish. Chen Ping'an is just sulking. He used to do this all the time; if he was upset with me, no matter how much I trailed after him, trying to say nice things, he wouldn’t pay me any attention. It’s just like today. But every time he saw me or my mother getting bullied by the neighbors, he would still help us. After that, I’d cry and throw a tantrum, and he’d always stop being angry. Ah, it’s a pity I don’t have that snot anymore; that was my greatest asset, you know? Whenever Chen Ping'an helped me and my mother, as soon as I sniffled, he would crack a smile. After that, he’d never be mad at me again.”

The little mudfish nodded in understanding.

Only Gu Can and it knew why it had once taken a step back on the street.

It was genuinely afraid.

That fear stemmed from a deep-rooted reverence and trepidation regarding its own path.

Even Chen Ping'an himself, along with the entire Lijuzhou cave and Gu Can’s current master, the Celestial River True Monarch Liu Zhimiao, might not understand the reason.

Because this little mudfish was different from the golden carp trapped in Li Er’s basket or the five-legged snake in Song Jixin’s yard. The chance to capture the little mudfish was a significant opportunity, one that Chen Ping'an alone had grasped! It was the only opportunity he had managed to seize in Lijuzhou, and in doing so, he had given it to Gu Can, who had approached him earnestly, thus transforming it into an opportunity for Gu Can's own path.

But this did not hinder the fact that to the little mudfish, Chen Ping'an remained half its master!

While Chen Ping'an could no longer control the little mudfish, now a Nascent Soul being, the only reason it would dare to act against him would be if its current master, Gu Can, commanded it to.

Gu Can suddenly leaned over the table, saying, “Little mudfish, besides my mother, the only person who truly wants to give me their best is Chen Ping'an. Whether he was a kiln worker or now, he’s always been like this; whenever he has a little money, he won’t spend it on himself. If I’m craving something, he won’t hesitate to buy it, even telling me he’s making a fortune. I only found out later because Liu Xianyang let it slip. Little mudfish, why do you think Chen Ping'an is angry?”

The little mudfish shook its head.

Gu Can turned, his head resting on the table, hands tucked into his sleeves, “So how long do you think Chen Ping'an will stay angry this time? I’m so afraid to talk to him about the maidens… What should I do?”

Gu Can’s tears flowed freely. “I know this time Chen Ping'an is different. In the past, when others bullied my mother and me, he would feel sorry for me. No matter how unreasonable I was or how angry I got, he would never deny me as his brother. But now it’s different; my mother and I are living well. Chen Ping'an might think that even without him, we can manage just fine, so he’ll keep being angry, and he might never speak to me again. But I want to tell him that it’s not like that! Without Chen Ping'an, I would be heartbroken; I would be sad for a lifetime. If Chen Ping'an ignores me, I won’t stop him! I’ll just let him know that if he dares to ignore me, I’ll become an even bigger villain! I’ll do even worse things, so that wherever he goes, whether to Baoping Zhou or Tongye Zhou, or even Zhongtu Shen Zhou, everyone will hear of Gu Can’s name!”

Gu Can stretched out his hands, covering his face.

This was the second time Gu Can had shown such vulnerability since arriving at Booklet Lake, the first being during the Mid-Autumn Festival on Qingxia Island when he had spoken of Chen Ping'an.

The little mudfish, feeling the emotional connection with Gu Can, shared in his sorrow, and tears rolled down its cheeks as well.

————

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 446: Another Bowl of Rice on the Table (Part Two)**

The floating ship finally reached Azure Gorge Island.

As he disembarked, Chen Ping'an took out a jade token and handed it to the little mudfish. In a low voice, he said, "Give this to Liu Zhimiao. Tell him to keep it for now and return it to me when I leave Azure Gorge Island. Also, let him know that while I’m on the island, I don’t want to see him, not even once."

When the little mudfish received the token, it felt like a child grasping a piece of red-hot coal. It let out a sharp scream that echoed through the skies, nearly transforming into a gigantic dragon in anger, wishing it could smash the Azure Gorge Island pier to pieces.

Just as it contemplated discarding the token, Chen Ping'an's expression remained impassive. "Hold on to it!"

Filled with fear and enduring the pain, the little mudfish tightly gripped the strange jade token engraved with the words "I nurture the vast righteous qi" and set off to find the River Cut Immortal.

At the pier, there were already people waiting, bowing and scraping, fawning over Gu Can.

Chen Ping'an turned to Gu Can and said, "Please tell Auntie that I’d like to have another home-cooked meal. Just a bowl of rice will do."

Gu Can nodded vigorously; as long as Chen Ping'an was willing to sit down for a meal, he instructed an elderly caretaker from Azure Gorge Island to hurry back home and inform his mother, requesting a simple table of home-cooked dishes without any extravagant dishes!

Leading the way, Gu Can walked beside Chen Ping'an, deliberately slowing his pace.

Gu Can thought Chen Ping'an wanted to enjoy a leisurely stroll before reaching the house, so he intentionally dragged his feet.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an spoke up, "I’ve been in Pool Water City these past few days, asking around about you and Azure Gorge Island. I’ve heard a lot of things."

Gu Can lowered his head. "I figured that out."

Chen Ping'an continued, "There are some things I’m afraid I won’t be able to say at the dinner table, so before I see Auntie, I might have a few things to say that you won’t want to hear. I hope you’ll listen to me until I finish. After I’m done, you can share your thoughts. I hope it doesn’t turn out like that assassin. You don’t have to worry about whether or not I want to hear what you say; I just want to know what you think. Say whatever you want."

Gu Can replied, "You talk, I’ll listen."

Chen Ping'an spoke slowly, "I’m sorry for being late."

Gu Can abruptly stopped in his tracks.

Chen Ping'an halted as well. In the eyes of the curious cultivators on Azure Gorge Island, he appeared to be a "middle-aged man" with a listless expression. His face was hard to read, but his eyes revealed the weariness of his heart, which he couldn’t conceal.

The parting between the young boy in straw sandals and the little snot-nosed kid in Mud Bottle Alley had come too hastily. Apart from Gu Can's large bag of locust leaves, the need to be cautious of Liu Zhimiao, and the responsibility of taking care of that small child’s mother, there were many things Chen Ping'an had left unsaid.

Looking up at the peak of Azure Gorge Island, Chen Ping'an continued, "After that little snot-nosed kid left home, I soon followed, embarking on my own journey through the world, facing all sorts of bumps along the way. So I’ve always feared one thing: I’m afraid that little snot-nosed kid might become like you. And I, Chen Ping'an, might end up as the kind of person we both despised the most back then—a big man who bullies women without men at home, someone who uses his strength to intimidate the sons of such women. A drunkard who sees a passing child and kicks them just for fun, sending them rolling on the ground. Every time I think of Gu Can, the first thing that comes to my mind is worrying about that little snot-nosed kid in a strange place, wondering if he’s doing well. The second thing is worrying that once he’s doing well, that little snot-nosed kid, known for holding grudges, might slowly transform into someone who has greater strength and skills and, in moments of bad mood, would kick a child without a care for their life or death. Would that child suffer to death? Would Chen Ping'an rescue that child only for them to return home, and then, in their mother’s sorrow, have to spend a lot of copper coins on medicine at Yang's shop? After that, their livelihood would become even more difficult. I fear this."

"But I can’t blame anyone else. I can only blame myself. After I returned to the small town from the Great Sui for the second time, I clearly intended to go south to Old Dragon City, yet I was unwilling to take my time delivering swords. I should have taken a detour, even if it meant delaying for a few months, just to see that little snot-nosed kid and check on how he and his mother were really doing instead of relying on some news that suggested they were living well. I thought I could visit him later when I was more successful and able to provide him with more."

"While traveling through the world, life and death are in my hands. If you kill the Azure Gorge Island’s worshippers, if you kill your senior brother, if you kill today's assassin, as long as I, Chen Ping'an, am present, you won’t kill them. If they come, I’ll kill them. If a thousand come, I’ll kill a thousand. If one million come, and I can only kill 999,999 of them, then I’ll blame my fists for not being strong enough, my sword for not being fast enough! Because I promised you, I promised myself, that protecting that little snot-nosed kid is my most righteous duty—it doesn’t even require reasoning!"

"But you, Gu Can, have a thousand or ten thousand reasons to tell yourself and me, Chen Ping'an, that the place of Book Simple Lake is a filthy place, and the world is just as it is. If I don’t kill to establish my authority, others will come to kill me. None of these are valid reasons for you, Gu Can, to massacre the innocent. So many people have died inexplicably, people who didn’t even know the reason for their deaths. After you kill them, if you can pass over that mental hurdle, I, Chen Ping'an, can’t. I think of all those people—dozens, hundreds—those who were just like that little snot-nosed kid following behind the mud-legged Chen Ping'an in Mud Bottle Alley. And then they all die. That kid who was nearly starving to death in Mud Bottle Alley, who wouldn’t even knock on the door, who walked through Mud Bottle Alley time and time again without dying, and that little snot-nosed kid who kicked a drunken bastard didn’t die either."

Chen Ping'an paused, patting Gu Can on the shoulder. "Let’s go. Auntie is still waiting for us. No matter how difficult the road is, we must walk it."

The two walked side by side.

Chen Ping'an continued, "I don’t want to be a moral saint, but just because I’m not one doesn’t mean we can disregard all reasoning."

"I don’t care if others are reasonable or not. Gu Can, I have to care. Whether it’s useful or not, I have to try. After my parents died, I lost all my relatives. Liu Xianyang and you, Gu Can, are my only family. The world is so vast, and in that small town, you and Liu Xianyang are my only relatives. I can ignore everything else, but even if the sky truly falls, if it crushes you two, I, Chen Ping'an, regardless of how capable I am, must try to hold up that fallen sky! Even if I can’t lift it back up, even if I die, I must help you seek justice!"

Back in the Pearl Cave Heaven.

For the sake of Liu Xianyang, Chen Ping'an had once resolved to face death just to seek justice for Liu Xianyang.

Now, at Book Simple Lake, he felt as though merely speaking these words had drained all his spirit.

Different experiences, yet they had once made Chen Ping'an sit there alone like a dog by the roadside.

"If I hadn’t met you, Gu Can, if you had caused a ruckus at Book Simple Lake, I would have just heard about it and wouldn’t have cared. I wouldn’t have come to Pool Water City, wouldn’t have come to Azure Gorge Island, because I, Chen Ping'an, can’t handle it. My abilities are limited. In the residence of the bride-dress female ghost, I didn’t intervene. In a county city of Huangting Kingdom, I saw those sword cultivators and didn’t intervene. In the Dragon River Gorge, I intervened and lost the mountain-shaped seal that Mr. Qi had given me. In Old Dragon City, I intervened and pierced a cultivator's abdomen. In this world, if you want to reason, you have to pay a price. But not reasoning comes with a price too! That old dragon in the Dragon River Gorge nearly flattened the sword cultivators, and Du Mao was beaten to near death! They are like this, and so are you, Gu Can. You live well today, but what about tomorrow? The day after tomorrow? Next year? The year after that?! You can help others reunite today, but tomorrow, others can just as easily make your mother accompany you in the grave!"

"If I could, I would want that little snot-nosed kid named Gu Can to always live at the end of Mud Bottle Alley. I wouldn’t want to have sent you that little mudfish back then. I just want you to live in Mud Bottle Alley. As long as I return home, I can see you and Auntie. Whether your family has become a little wealthier or I, Chen Ping'an, have become rich, you two can afford beautiful clothes and delicious food, living a stable life like that."

As they approached a grand mansion, brightly lit and comparable to a noble's residence.

Chen Ping'an's gaze dimmed as he softly said, "I’m done talking. I don’t have the strength to say anything more, so when we reach the dinner table, you can say what you want, and I’ll listen."

Gu Can raised his arm to wipe his face, but remained silent.

The mansion was large, and it took a long time just to walk to the dining area after passing through the grand entrance.

As Chen Ping'an crossed the threshold, he removed the meticulously crafted masked face and revealed his true self.

A splendidly dressed woman stood at the entrance of the hall, eagerly waiting. Upon seeing Chen Ping'an next to Gu Can, her eyes immediately reddened. She hurried down the stairs, coming to Chen Ping'an's side, carefully examining the now much taller youth before her. In that moment, a flood of emotions overwhelmed her, and she covered her mouth, unable to utter a word despite a thousand feelings swirling within her. Deep down, the woman felt immense guilt. When Liu Zhimiao visited and spoke about the little mudfish, she had harbored a malicious intent. She had hoped to secure that opportunity for her son, wanting that boy who had helped her and her son for many years.

Dead is dead.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Auntie."

The woman choked, "Good, good, good. As long as you and my Can'er are doing well, that’s better than anything else. Hurry inside, the steward on the island said it was urgent. I only managed to prepare two dishes; the rest were done by the household staff, but all were made according to our hometown's flavors. It will certainly be authentic home-cooked food, Chen Ping'an. You won’t find it unacceptable."

Chen Ping'an replied, "Thank you, Auntie."

The woman shot him a glare. "What nonsense!"

Chen Ping'an fell silent.

The mother and son, along with one who wouldn’t be considered an outsider, entered the house together and took their seats.

Though it was home-cooked food, it was still quite lavish, filling a large table.

The woman had also prepared the rare Celestial Wu Ti liquor from Book Simple Lake, a far cry from the so-called Wu Ti liquor sold in the marketplaces of Pool Water City.

She poured Chen Ping'an a full cup of wine, and no matter how much he protested, she wouldn’t relent.

Even Gu Can, who generally despised alcohol, especially at home, requested a cup from his mother today.

The woman hesitated for a moment but smiled as she poured a cup.

At a large round table, the woman sat at the head, Chen Ping'an sat with his back to the door, and Gu Can sat in the chair between them.

Gu Can turned to his mother and said, "Before we eat, I want to talk to Chen Ping'an."

The woman, keenly observant, had noticed something was off but maintained her smile. "Sure, you two talk. After you finish your drinks, I’ll pour more for you."

Gu Can gulped down his drink, covering his cup to signal he was done with wine, then turned to Chen Ping'an and asked, "Chen Ping'an, how do you think I, Gu Can, should protect my mother? Do you know how many times I and my mother almost died on Azure Gorge Island?"

The woman’s heart trembled, her expression stiffening as she sat there, her hands twisting the hem of her clothes under the table.

Gu Can continued, "Is it only about killing those who have harmed me? What about the mastermind behind that assassin? What about the bad people lurking in the shadows?"

"Should I go find them one by one and greet them first? Tell them I, Gu Can, am very capable, and that the little mudfish is even more capable, so they shouldn’t provoke me? If they do, I’ll kill them?"

"Do you think those assassination attempts on Azure Gorge Island were all done by outsiders? That the enemies are just asking for it?"

"Do you think it’s impossible that Liu Zhimiao, my good master, is behind this? Hiding among those murders?"

"You, Chen Ping'an, might say that it’s not certain. Yes, that’s true, and I won’t lie to you by saying Liu Zhimiao is definitely involved! But my mother is the only one I have, and I, Gu Can, have only one life. Why should I gamble on that 'maybe'?"

Gu Can stood up, furious. "Chen Ping'an! You can beat me to death today, and I won’t fight back, but before you kill me, I need to tell you that I, Gu Can, have done nothing wrong! Even if I was wrong, I won’t admit it! I won’t change! Not in this lifetime! I won’t change even if I die!"

Gu Can’s face was twisted with rage, but it wasn’t directed at the person he usually hated. Instead, it was a deep-seated hatred for himself, for Book Simple Lake, for everyone, and the enormous grievance of not being understood by the one he cared for the most.

"I’m here, gambling with tigers. If I don’t strip their skin and wear it myself, I’ll freeze to death. If I don’t drink their blood and eat their flesh, my mother and I will starve to death! Chen Ping'an, I tell you, this isn’t our home in Mud Bottle Alley. There are not just those disgusting adults trying to steal my mother’s clothes. The people here will devour my mother until nothing remains, making her wish she were dead! I won’t just encounter a drunken bastard who looks down on me in the alley and kicks me!"

"Do you know how scared I am here?"

"Do you know how much I wish you could be by my side again, protecting me? Protecting my mother well?"

"Chen Ping'an, you don’t know!"

"You just know how to hit me and scold me!"

Finally, with tears streaming down his face, Gu Can sobbed, "I don’t want the next time you see me and my mother to be at Book Simple Lake, when you come to visit our graves! I still want to see you, Chen Ping'an…"

Gu Can staggered out of the room, but he didn’t go far, plopping down on the threshold.

Chen Ping'an remained seated, lifting his head to the woman and rasping, "Auntie, I won’t drink anymore. Could you please serve me a bowl of rice?"

The anxious woman quickly wiped away her tears, nodded, and got up to bring Chen Ping'an a bowl of rice. He stood to accept the bowl, gently placing it on the table before taking his seat again.

Once more, there was a bowl of rice on the table.

Back in those days at someone else's home in Mud Bottle Alley, when Chen Ping'an was still a child smaller than Gu Can, there had been a bowl of rice placed on the table just like this.

Chen Ping'an raised a trembling hand but ultimately did not pick up the chopsticks. Instead, he pulled out an old, yellowing martial arts manual from his robe and placed it beside the bowl of rice.

The book, a battered martial arts manual, had accompanied him through countless mountains and rivers, witnessing all of Chen Ping'an's joys and sorrows.

Having flipped through it so many times, it remained pristine, nearly without a crease.

He had only shown it to the old man in the Bamboo Loft once, and during that occasion, Chen Ping'an had wished the old man would handle it carefully with every turn of the page. After all, he had rambled endlessly, resulting in the old man receiving a beating for saying that someone practicing martial arts should not be so careless with a worn book while aspiring to hold the world’s essence within their fists.

He had shown it to the girl he cherished. At that time, they hadn’t liked each other yet. He had to show her the manual so she could understand its contents. It had caused her displeasure, as she misunderstood him to think he looked down on her, believing she coveted the manual's techniques and would steal them.

A bowl of rice is a life-saving grace.

A martial arts manual is also a life-saving grace.

Chen Ping'an bit his lip, not turning his head, and softly said, "Gu Can, we agreed back then that this manual was borrowed from me, and I would return it to you one day."

Gu Can suddenly stood up, shouting, "I don’t want it! If I give it to you, it’s yours! You said you’d return it, but I never agreed! You need to reason!"

Gu Can finally pleaded between sobs, "Chen Ping'an, don’t do this. I’m scared…"

In the eyes of this impetuous and exceptionally precocious child, only Chen Ping'an would be the one to reason with him, and it had always been this way.

Chen Ping'an remained silent, picking up the chopsticks and lowering his head to eat.

He didn’t look up again until he finished that bowl of rice.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 447: The Light of Truth, The Most Sincere Heart

After Gu Can finished speaking through her tears, the woman hung her head low, trembling all over, unsure whether it was from sadness or anger.

Chen Ping'an gently set down his chopsticks and called out softly, "Gu Can."

"Here!" Gu Can immediately wiped her tears and replied loudly.

Chen Ping'an continued, his tone calm, “I will scold you, I will hit you, and I will share the insights I’ve come to understand, even if they seem completely wrong to you. But I will not abandon you; I will not just leave you behind like that.”

He didn’t turn to face her, but his voice carried a firm resolve, as if he was speaking not only to Gu Can but also to himself. “If one day I leave, it will be because I’ve crossed that hurdle in my heart. If I can’t get past it, I’ll stay here, at Qingxia Island and Shujian Lake.”

Gu Can’s tear-streaked face lit up with a smile. “Okay! You keep your word; Chen Ping'an, you’ve never lied to me!”

Chen Ping'an suddenly added, “But today, I might have to make an exception.”

Gu Can’s heart leaped into her throat. The momentary relaxation of her body tensed once again, her nerves fraying.

Chen Ping'an said, “Earlier, on the way here, I mentioned that at the dinner table, I would let you speak without interruption. However, after having this meal, I feel I’ve regained some strength, so I’d like to talk again. As per our usual rule, I’ll speak, and you’ll listen. After that, if you want to say something, then it’ll be my turn to listen. Regardless of who is speaking, both the speaker and listener should take their time.”

With a radiant smile, Gu Can scratched her head and asked, “Chen Ping'an, can I return to the table? I haven’t eaten yet!”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “Eat more; you’re at the age where you need to grow.”

Gu Can wiped her face, walked back to her original spot, but shifted her chair closer to Chen Ping'an, fearful that he might change his mind, break his promise, and leave Qingxia Island. She wanted to make sure she could stop him quickly if he tried to go.

She hurriedly filled her bowl with rice and began to eat, her head bowed. Ever since she was little, she had enjoyed mimicking Chen Ping'an—whether it was how to eat or how to tuck her hands into her sleeves. In the cold of winter, the two of them, both poor and friendless, would warm their hands by tucking them in their sleeves, especially after building a snowman together. They would shiver, then burst into laughter, teasing each other. When it came to insults and banter, Gu Can, with her runny nose, had already surpassed Chen Ping'an, often leaving him speechless.

Chen Ping'an glanced at Gu Can before turning to the woman. “Auntie, if today another child was wandering outside, would you open the door and give them a bowl of rice? Would you still tell them that this meal isn’t free, that it must be repaid with money from selling medicinal herbs?”

The woman carefully considered her words.

Chen Ping'an continued, “I think you probably wouldn’t.”

“Of course, I don’t believe you made the wrong choice, Auntie. Even if we set aside Shujian Lake’s circumstances, I wouldn’t think you were wrong for your decision back then.”

“So that bowl of rice from years ago, I will never forget it. It reassured me, Chen Ping'an, that I wasn't the beggar my mother forbade me to be, but someone who owed a debt to Auntie and could repay it after eating.”

The woman turned her head, wiping her eyes.

Chen Ping'an asked calmly, “But Auntie, have you considered that without that bowl of rice, I would never have given that little loach to your son? You might still be living in Mud Bottle Alley, enduring a life you find so difficult and impoverished. So, there is a saying that good deeds are rewarded and evil deeds punished; we should believe in that. We cannot only believe in good rewards when life is stable, forgetting about the consequences of wrongdoing.”

“Do you think what I said is right?”

The woman remained silent, tears streaming down her face, unable to answer yes or no.

She feared that anything she said today might negatively impact Gu Can’s future.

So she chose to say nothing at all.

Chen Ping'an understood this. Even when Gu Can spoke of the woman’s choice regarding the little loach, he held no resentment.

What should be appreciated should be appreciated for a lifetime.

Regardless of what happened afterward, right or wrong, it could not overshadow the kindness shown in the beginning. Just like a heavy snowfall in his hometown, the deep snow on the muddy roads of Mud Bottle Alley would eventually melt away come spring, revealing the familiar paths once again.

The only difference was that Chen Ping'an had traveled far and learned not to impose his reasoning on others.

So today, he was willing to listen carefully to all of Gu Can’s thoughts, the inner feelings of the little snot-nosed child.

Chen Ping'an forced a smile. “Auntie, don’t worry; I won’t force Gu Can to learn from me. There’s no need for that; I don’t have that ability. I just want to see if I can do something, something that both Gu Can and I currently feel is ‘right.’ I’m here to support Gu Can in protecting you, and I wouldn’t dream of asking you to give up the hard-won comforts you have now.”

“Is that alright?”

The woman hesitated but eventually nodded with difficulty.

Chen Ping'an remained seated, not reaching for the pot of dark wine on the table or the sword gourd at his waist. He spoke softly, “Let me share some good news with Auntie and Gu Can. Although Uncle Gu has passed away, he hasn’t truly died; he’s still with us as a spirit. However, this is ultimately a good thing. I came to Shujian Lake because he risked a lot to tell me that you are here, not in a state of ‘utter peace.’ That’s why I came. I don’t want a day to come when Gu Can’s actions take away the chance you three have at being a family together. My parents once said that Uncle Gu was the best match for Auntie in the nearby alleys. I hope that such a good man from Mud Bottle Alley, who could write beautiful Spring Festival couplets and bore no resemblance to a mere farmer, doesn’t have to suffer.”

The woman covered her mouth, and her tears flowed freely.

This time, it was the most genuine and heartfelt moment, entirely unrelated to right or wrong.

Chen Ping'an continued softly, “Auntie, Gu Can, we three have all suffered greatly from the unreasonable hardships imposed by others. We are not those born into comfort, nor are we from families where knowledge is easily accessible. Both Auntie and I have faced moments in our lives when we nearly succumbed to despair. I’m sure Auntie only persevered for Gu Can, while I did so to honor my parents. We’ve all gritted our teeth and endured. Thus, we understand well what ‘not easy’ truly means. On this point, Gu Can, being the youngest, has had it even harder since leaving Mud Bottle Alley, as he has to deal with challenges far greater than either of us. At his age, he already faces more difficulties than I or his mother do. No matter how poor Auntie and I are, we never need to worry about dying every single day like Gu Can does.”

“But that doesn’t prevent us from asking ‘why’ when life gets tough. However, no one would come to explain why to me, so perhaps after some consideration, we often get slapped back the next day. Over time, we stop asking why because it seems futile. When we’re struggling to survive, it feels like overthinking even a little is a mistake—mistakes on our part, mistakes on others, mistakes in the world. If the world strikes me with a punch, why shouldn’t I retaliate? Every person who has endured this seems to become that unreasonable person from back then, unwilling to listen to others’ ‘whys’ because they become indifferent, thinking that if they’re too soft-hearted, they can’t hold onto what they have now, and it would be a betrayal of the suffering they’ve endured! Why do the teachers favor the children of rich families? Why did my parents have to be looked down upon by the neighbors? Why can others afford kites while I can only watch from the sidelines? Why must I toil in the fields while so many enjoy comfort at home, even ignoring me on the road? Why is it that what I’ve worked so hard for, others have from birth, and yet they don’t appreciate it? Why do families gather every Mid-Autumn Festival while I can only yearn for that?”

“I don’t know why it is this way. I don’t know what it was like a hundred years ago or a thousand years ago, and I can’t tell if the world has gotten better or worse. I’ve read many books and learned some principles, but the more I know, the less certain I become that my insights are correct and can help myself and those around me live better lives. Before I got here, I thought I could help a little girl live a better life, but after seeing Gu Can, I realized I might have been mistaken. That little girl might have only been able to live a bit better because I was near her, not necessarily because I taught her those principles that made her life easier.”

“Who doesn’t want to live, to live well? Everyone hopes that tomorrow will be better than today. I want that too! I thought about it in Mud Bottle Alley, on the way to Daxui Academy, to Old Dragon City, to Hanging Mountain, to Tongye Island, to the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, and even on the road back home. I’ve thought about it constantly! But there are no highest truths; surely, there must be some lowest standards of right and wrong? Even if we’ve done countless things we had to do just to survive, there is still right and wrong, isn’t there?”

Gu Can paused, her chopsticks resting as she fell deep in thought.

The woman looked at Chen Ping'an, then at Gu Can. “Chen Ping'an, I’m just an uneducated woman, someone who doesn’t know much or think deeply. I only want Gu Can to live well, for the two of us to live well. It’s because we’ve endured so much to reach this opportunity today that I’m here, waiting to hear from you, Chen Ping'an, that my husband, Gu Can’s father, is still alive and that we have a chance to be a family again. Can you understand what I’m saying? You won’t think poorly of me for being ignorant, right?”

Chen Ping'an nodded. “I understand. I wouldn’t hold it against Auntie.”

The woman gazed into Chen Ping'an's eyes. She poured herself a glass of wine and drank it in one go, then filled another glass and drank that too. “You came to find Gu Can, and no matter what you’ve said, Gu Can is very happy. I want to drink a cup for you sharing this good news, another for my own happiness.”

She poured a third glass and, after drinking it, her eyes filled with tears. “Seeing you, Chen Ping'an, you’ve grown taller and matured, safe and sound. Auntie wants to drink another cup, to celebrate your parents’ happiness too.”

Chen Ping'an picked up the wine pot and poured himself a glass, raising it to his lips and finishing it in one go.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 448: Chen Ping'an Remains Unchanged

Within the high towers of Water City, Cui Qian clicked his tongue in admiration. “Long hair and short sight? That woman from Mud Bottle Alley is remarkable in her own right. No wonder she could partner with Liu Zhimao and raise someone like Gu Can.”

During Chen Ping'an’s entry into the city behind the two horse-drawn carriages, Cui Dongshan had been feigning death. However, once Chen Ping'an met Gu Can, Cui Dongshan had already opened his eyes.

Everything that followed was observed and heard by Cui Dongshan, just like Cui Qian.

Cui Qian smiled, “What Chen Ping'an said was in vain. Even if they both came from Mud Bottle Alley and experienced hardships, Gu Can and Chen Ping'an have become completely different people. It’s not just their positions that differ; their perspectives on the world are fundamentally different. Chen Ping'an can empathize with Gu Can, but that’s only because he has walked a longer path. For Gu Can, his hometown of Mud Bottle Alley to Shuojian Lake is the entirety of the jianghu (rivers and lakes, a term for the world of martial arts) and the world itself. Besides, Gu Can has this nature of his; he tends to get fixated and is prone to extremes. Not even Chen Ping'an, nor Gu Can's father Gu Tao, standing in Chen Ping'an's shoes, could change Gu Can's temperament. The interesting part is that Gu Can's extremity deepens his feelings for Chen Ping'an. That’s why he said, ‘Even if you beat me to death, I won’t retaliate.’ This is the true sentiment of this chaotic troublemaker. How rare is that? Chen Ping'an knows this, and that’s why he suffers even more. Chen Ping'an even heard with his own ears what Liu Xianyang, the dying man from back then, said before he passed: ‘Chen Ping'an, I don’t want to die; I really don’t want to die.’ Now, Chen Ping'an suffers even more.”

“Human nature is like this; even a frog at the bottom of a well can bellow in discontent. The further someone has left the well, the more any reasoning they try to convey to those still at the bottom comes off as empty talk. Deep down, they will constantly tell themselves that those reasons are for the pure and untainted, not for those who wallow in the mud. If they listen and truly absorb it, they’d be courting death. However, Chen Ping'an has realized this.”

“So, what was discussed on the way to Gu Can's residence and what was talked about at the dining table after finishing that bowl of rice are worlds apart. It’s unfortunate that at that time in Mud Bottle Alley, Gu Can was still too young. He neither truly saw the circumstances Chen Ping'an faced at his age nor witnessed the hardships and trials Chen Ping'an endured on his long journey. All Gu Can could see was Chen Ping'an carrying a sword and giving a jade pendant to a little loach, a Chen Ping'an who had already grasped so many principles. As for why Chen Ping'an managed to reach his current state, he doesn’t understand, and this child may not even wish to truly understand. In contrast, Chen Ping'an is willing to think more, to ponder further, which only tangles the chaos even more. If the two switched places, and Chen Ping'an had Gu Can's temperament and traveled far, while Gu Can had Chen Ping'an's temperament and merely survived on Qingxia Island, today wouldn’t be such a deadlock. But then again, we wouldn’t be sitting here.”

Cui Qian turned to Cui Dongshan, “In fact, your master has done quite well.”

Cui Dongshan's face stiffened. “Can your old dog eyes still see anything good?”

Cui Qian shrugged off the comment with a smile. “The most impressive part of Chen Ping'an’s journey to Qingxia Island lies in two phrases, four words—what you little rascal told me before—cutting off and defining human feelings.”

“On the ship, he first brought forth the remaining commonalities between Chen Ping'an and Gu Can, placing them before each other. Otherwise, on that ship, Chen Ping'an would have already lost, and we could have left Water City. That was to first probe that assassin, not only to understand the hearts of the people from Shuojian Lake better but also to ultimately tell Gu Can that the assassin should be killed anywhere he appears, and that Chen Ping'an is willing to listen to Gu Can’s reasoning. If Chen Ping'an raises his reasoning too high, deliberately positioning himself on a moral high ground to try and influence Gu Can, then Gu Can might directly feel that Chen Ping'an is no longer the Chen Ping'an from back in the day. Everything would be over.”

“After disembarking, placing that pendant of the Confucian sage in front of Liu Zhimao, who is a Nascent Soul cultivator with enough insight, would prevent this Jiujing Zhenjun from meddling.”

“At the dining table, after the meal, Gu Can’s mother must be taken out of the equation, ensuring she doesn’t interfere too much with him and influence Gu Can.”

“Otherwise, it would be a mess; adding Chen Ping'an to it would only make it more chaotic.”

Cui Dongshan sneered, “Even so, is it useful? Isn’t it still a deadlock?”

Cui Qian nodded. “But as long as Chen Ping'an can’t get over this mental hurdle, whatever he does next will be a new knot in his heart. Even if Gu Can is willing to bow his head and admit his mistakes, what then? After all, there are so many innocents who have died unjustly, haunting him like lingering spirits, constantly knocking on his door, shouting grievances, day and night, questioning his conscience. The first difficulty lies in whether Gu Can is willing to admit his mistakes. The second difficulty lies in how Chen Ping'an can clarify the myriad principles he has read, heard from others, and pondered himself, to find the foundation of his own reasoning. The third difficulty lies in whether, after understanding, he will realize he was actually wrong and if he can uphold his true nature. The fourth difficulty lies in how Chen Ping'an will act. The hardest parts are three and four. As for the third difficulty, Chen Ping'an is destined to struggle.”

Cui Dongshan asked about Chen Ping'an’s final mental barrier, “The fourth difficulty?”

Cui Qian appeared to be cryptic. “It’s difficult because there are innumerable challenges.”

Cui Dongshan responded with a cold laugh.

Cui Qian remained unfazed. “If Chen Ping'an truly has the ability to face the fourth difficulty, then after we’ve seen it, it will clearly tell us why there are so many foolish and wicked people in this world, and why, despite everyone knowing so many principles, they still live worse than dogs. Then they’ll turn into Zhu Lu, our Great Li's Lady Du Mao. Why can’t we be like Qi Jingchun or Ah Liang? But sadly, Chen Ping'an won’t reach that point, because reaching that point means he has already lost. At that time, if you’re interested, you can stay here and slowly watch your master become gaunt and haggard, while I will have long since left.”

Cui Dongshan let out an “oh.” “Are you in a hurry to be reincarnated as you leave here?”

Cui Qian laughed heartily, extending a finger to poke Cui Dongshan. “You should learn from your master, to maintain composure and learn to temper your anger, so you can restrain yourself.”

Cui Qian turned his gaze back to the painting on the ground. “I believe Gu Can still won’t admit his mistakes. What do you think?”

Cui Dongshan closed his eyes again, not out of feigning death, but more like waiting for death.

Cui Qian then muttered to himself, “They say there’s no banquet that doesn’t disperse. Some banquets remain with the empty seats waiting for people to return one by one, but the banquet at Qingxia Island has already dispersed, even if the people are still here. Everyone speaks their own words and drinks their own wine; it’s not a reunion banquet anymore. It doesn't count.”

Chen Ping'an led Gu Can to a resplendent room, not a standalone courtyard. It was adjacent to the room where Gu Can occasionally stayed.

Chen Ping'an suggested Gu Can spend some time talking with his mother.

After closing the door, Gu Can thought for a moment, then decided not to seek his mother, instead opting for a stroll, quickly followed by that little loach.

It communicated with Gu Can through the voice of the heart lake, “When Liu Zhimao saw that jade pendant at first, he didn’t believe it. After confirming its authenticity, he seemed completely stunned.”

Gu Can smiled and responded, “I told you, Chen Ping'an would be impressive. You didn’t believe it before; how about now? Do you believe it now?”

It sighed softly.

Gu Can felt an urge to slap to death that woman from the Golden Dan sect who was already imprisoned in the water prison.

But after talking with Chen Ping'an, he realized that killing that assassin from the Zhu Ying Dynasty wouldn’t change anything.

Chen Ping'an's anger did not stem from those assassins.

It wasn’t with those opposing cultivators, but rather with the innocents who had perished, those who were caught up in the repercussions akin to “exterminating nine clans,” the lowly souls who suffered.

It was with those like the snot-nosed kids from Mud Bottle Alley and the apprentices from the Longyao kiln.

Suddenly, Gu Can asked, “There are some things I want to say to Chen Ping'an, but is it appropriate for me to go find him now?”

The little loach, appearing with the guise of a young girl, scratched its head, something Gu Can had learned from Chen Ping'an, and it was now mimicking Gu Can.

Gu Can chuckled. “You’re being silly.”

It quickly retracted its hand, blushing.

Gu Can waved his hand, “Come on, he’s Chen Ping'an! What’s there that can’t be said?”

Gu Can looked around, feeling that the once detestable Qingxia Island had become charming and lovely since that person arrived.

If one day Chen Ping'an was no longer angry and was willing to stay in his new home, then this place would undoubtedly be the most picturesque spot in the world!

Outside that room, without waiting for Gu Can to knock, Chen Ping'an already said, “Come in.”

Gu Can found Chen Ping'an standing at the doorway of the study. On the desk lay paper, a carving knife, and a stack of bamboo slips.

It seemed Chen Ping'an was planning to write something?

Before Gu Can returned, Chen Ping'an had been introspecting, attempting to genuinely put himself in Gu Can’s position and perspective to view Shuojian Lake.

Chen Ping'an tried to return to the initial point.

Starting from the smallest principle.

This was the first step of sequential reasoning, to establish order.

Chen Ping'an knew that “talking to oneself” wouldn’t work.

The two sat at the table in the living room, surrounded by shelves filled with exquisite treasures and antiques.

All of these were carefully selected and prepared by Gu Can for Chen Ping'an.

According to Gu Can’s original idea, this place should have been filled with open-minded young women, who would then turn to Chen Ping'an and say, “See, I told you back then, one day, I’d help you choose seventeen or eighteen beautiful girls just like that brat Zhi Gui. Now I’ve done it!”

But of course, Gu Can didn’t dare to do that now.

After sitting down, Gu Can got straight to the point. “Chen Ping'an, I roughly know why you’re angry. It’s just that my mother was present at that time. I couldn’t directly say those things, fearing she would think it was all her fault. Even though you might be angrier, I still believe I didn’t do anything wrong regarding what made you upset.”

Chen Ping'an spoke softly, “It’s all right. This time, let’s not rush to finish speaking. I’ll speak slowly, and you can answer at your own pace.”

Gu Can nodded.

Chen Ping'an suddenly asked, “Gu Can, do you feel disappointed?”

Gu Can shook his head. “I don’t like hearing anyone preach to me. Anyone who dares to nag me, I either beat them up or kill them—killing them is more common. Either way, you’ll find out eventually, and regardless, you said I must speak the truth. You can’t get angry at me for speaking my mind.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, then asked, “First, regarding that offering who should have died and your senior brother, the cultivators, servants, and maids at their residence. The little loach has already killed so many people. When leaving, did he kill them all? What I think doesn't matter; you tell me, is it really that important to kill or not?”

Gu Can answered honestly, “Not really important, but killing them would be better. That’s why I didn’t stop the little loach. In Shuojian Lake, that’s the correct approach. If you want to kill, want revenge, you must leave no grass behind. An island should be completely flattened; otherwise, there will be endless trouble. In Shuojian Lake, there are indeed many who slipped through the cracks back then, and decades or even centuries later, they might resurface, killing the family of the person who wronged them without leaving a trace. I’ve prepared for the day I might be killed for no reason. When that time comes, I, Gu Can, won’t beg for mercy, nor will I ask who they are or why they want to kill me. So this year, I’ve started to think about how to secure a future for my mother. I’ve thought a lot, but nothing seems like a perfect plan yet, so I’m still pondering. After all, the only people I care about in this world are my mother, you, Chen Ping'an, and now I must also include the father who has become a ghostly figure, even if I have no memory of him. As long as I know the three of you won’t face trouble because of me, then even if I die one day, I won’t regret it!”

Chen Ping'an listened earnestly to Gu Can’s words, not commenting on right or wrong, but continuing to ask, “Next, when you can protect yourself on Qingxia Island, why would you intentionally let an assassin go, allowing them to continue coming after you?”

Gu Can replied, “That’s a way to intimidate the bad people. It’s about killing them to the point they tremble in fear, scaring them to death, cutting off any potential enemies’ thoughts. Besides fighting with the little loach, I, Gu Can, must show that I’m worse and smarter than them! Otherwise, they would get restless, thinking they have a chance. This isn’t just my whim; Chen Ping'an, you’ve seen it for yourself. I’ve done this, and the little loach has been fierce enough, right? Yet even today, there are still assassins from the Zhu Ying Dynasty who don’t give up and want to come after me, right? Today it’s a Sword Cultivator of the Eighth Realm; next time it will definitely be one of the Ninth Realm.”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, drawing a line on the table with his finger while muttering to himself, “Based on your reasoning, I somewhat understand your thoughts now. This is your way of thinking, Gu Can, and it works in Shuojian Lake. Although it doesn’t work for me, not every path in the world can be monopolized by me, Chen Ping'an, nor is my reasoning suitable for everyone and everywhere. So I won’t judge who is right or wrong between us. Let me ask you another question. If it wouldn’t harm you or your aunt… never mind, following your reasoning and that of Shuojian Lake, it wouldn’t work.”

Gu Can was baffled; Chen Ping'an hadn’t finished speaking before he had already negated himself?

Is there anyone in this world who discusses reasoning like this?

When arguing with someone, or in a nicer term, discussing reasoning, isn’t it just to win every point and leave no ground for the opponent, using words to defeat them? It’s just like fighting, where you need to take them down in one go.

Then Gu Can couldn’t help but chuckle, but quickly forced himself to maintain a serious expression. If he dared to laugh out loud now, he feared Chen Ping'an would slap him again. Would he dare to retaliate?

He wouldn’t have any choice but to endure it.

Besides, even if he hit Chen Ping'an a few times, Gu Can wouldn’t be the least bit angry.

No one in the world would dare hit Gu Can, not even his mother.

Only Chen Ping'an would, not out of hatred, but out of genuine concern, genuine anger, and genuine disappointment that would lead him to strike.

Gu Can had known this back in Mud Bottle Alley.

Why was it that among the so-called “Ten Heroes of Shuojian Lake,” the one he was closest to was the foolish Fan Yan?

It was because Fan Yan, this kind of genuinely simple-minded fool, could say something so foolish as, “When I lightly hit my mother, I felt a bit sorry for her.”

At that moment, that little loach bore a smile as well.

No matter what, Chen Ping'an had not changed.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 449: Weighing Priorities, Defining Good and Evil

Even though Gu Can had changed so much, Chen Ping An remained the same Chen Ping An.

At this moment, Chen Ping An didn’t rush to speak.

Earlier, while preparing to write at his desk, he recalled something he had once told Pei Qian about the March Carp and the Spring Bird. He explained to Pei Qian that the compassion of someone who is well-fed and warmly dressed is precious, but it is unreasonable to preach such kindness to someone on the brink of starvation. To be human is to show mercy even towards those who are dying; to leap over their suffering to pity birds and frogs, as the Sage of Literature had taught him, is simply wrong.

When Chen Ping An reflected on these words in the context of Book Lake and Qingxia Island, it became clear.

This was not merely a matter of doing good or not; it was about how Gu Can and her mother should live their lives.

Thus, Chen Ping An began to introspect.

Differentiating right from wrong.

Weighing priorities.

Defining good and evil.

Each step must be taken with care; he could not simply jump ahead to explain his reasoning to Gu Can.

If he himself had not fully grasped the matter, then any words he spoke would be misguided, even if they were fundamentally correct. Such reasoning would be akin to building castles in the air.

Recalling the logic he had shared with Pei Qian, he naturally thought of Pei Qian’s hometown, Lotus Flower Paradise. This brought to mind his own restless days, when he visited the Heart-Mind Temple near Top Scholar Alley, where he met the kind-eyed old monk. He remembered the old monk, who rarely spoke of Buddhist teachings, telling him before he passed, “In all matters, avoid extremes. When reasoning with others, fear the mindset of ‘I must have all the reasoning,’ and the danger of becoming blind to the goodness in others once enmity is established.”

Finally, Chen Ping An remembered the inebriated Sage of Literature, who said, “How many books have you read to say that the world is ‘this way’? How many people have you met to declare that men and women ‘are of such character’? How much peace and suffering have you personally witnessed to judge the good and evil of others?”

So before Gu Can arrived, Chen Ping An picked up his brush and began to write, inscribing “Differentiate Priorities” and “Weighing Size” on two separate sheets of paper. 

He placed them side by side without pulling out a third sheet to write “Defining Good and Evil.”

On the first sheet labeled “Differentiate Priorities,” Chen Ping An began to list names.

Gu Can, Aunt, Liu Zhimiao, the Chief Offering of Qingxia Island, Senior Brother, the Golden Pill Assassin… and finally, “Chen Ping An.”

After finishing, he looked at the offerings, senior brother, and assassins that lacked names, and he fell into deep contemplation.

Just then, Gu Can arrived.

He had no choice but to put down his brush and rise from the desk.

At this moment, Gu Can noticed that Chen Ping An was lost in thought again.

Not wanting to disturb him, Gu Can leaned over the table, and after hesitating, the little loach mustered its courage to lie beside Gu Can.

The two heads watched the furrowed brow of Chen Ping An.

In fact, the little loach was quite curious about this man who was supposed to be its master, Chen Ping An.

Deep within Gu Can’s heart, an unfathomable thought lingered: if one day her own abilities were high enough, she would return it to Chen Ping An.

Even friends like Lü Caizang, whom Gu Can recognized, would only help with revenge if they were pushed to their limits, perhaps when Lü Caizang was killed.

Gu Can lay there and asked, “Chen Ping An, wasn’t that bowl of rice my mother gave you just a bowl of rice? If you went and knocked on someone’s door, begging your neighbors, would you really starve?”

Chen Ping An nodded, “That’s why I am even more grateful to your aunt.”

Gu Can asked, “Just because of that?”

Chen Ping An replied slowly, “Did you forget? I told you that my mother only let me avoid two things in this life: becoming a beggar and working in a dragon kiln.”

Gu Can sighed.

She asked again, “Looking back now, even if I hadn’t given you that broken fist manual, there would still be something like the Shaking Water Fist or the Shaking City Fist, right?”

Chen Ping An nodded again but said, “But that’s not how reasoning works.”

This world gives you a measure of kindness; it doesn’t mean that when the world later hands you malice, even if that malice far outweighs the kindness, you should wholly deny the world. Remember that bit of kindness, hold onto it, and keep it in mind.

This reflects what Cui Dongshan once mentioned about the context barrier. Each individual right and wrong exists independently, like the small lotus cave that Dao ancestors speak of. To put it simply, each instance of right or wrong is like a lotus flower rising from the water’s surface. Though beneath the pond’s surface lies a complex network of entangled roots, if one cannot even see the obvious lotus flowers and leaves above, how can one hope to perceive the truth beneath the water?

Gu Can smiled and said, “Chen Ping An, why don’t you ever change?”

Chen Ping An pondered for a moment, “Perhaps it’s because I’ve been luckier than you; I’ve encountered good people at crucial moments.”

Gu Can shook her head vigorously, “That’s not it; I met you too, and I was so little back then.”

Gu Can sniffled, “Back then, I had two streams of snot hanging from my nose every day.”

Chen Ping An frowned, seemingly trying to suppress a laugh.

Gu Can found an excuse to take the little loach and left.

Once the door closed and her footsteps faded into silence, Chen Ping An's expression and spirit deflated at once. After a long time, he wiped his face, realizing there were no tears.

Chen Ping An let out a soft breath, returned to the study, and sat back down at his desk.

He stood up again, removing his sword and the sword-raising gourd, placing them aside.

On the “Weighing Size” sheet, he wrote four lines.

Local Customs.

National Laws.

Continental Etiquette.

Universal Morality.

After finishing, Chen Ping An appeared weary, so he picked up the sword-raising gourd and took a sip of wine to invigorate himself.

Then, after writing “Local Customs,” he added the words “Book Lake.”

Gu Can returned to her room, where three young maidens awaited her. One was sent by Fan Yan from Pool Water City; she was a fallen noble from Stone Hair Country. The second was a disciple from the entire sect of Su Lin Island, which had been annihilated by Qingxia Island. The third was an outer disciple from Shu Ku Island, who had requested to become a maiden.

Gu Can sat at the table, propping her chin on one hand. She lined up the three maidens and asked, “I want to ask you a question. Just answer truthfully, and there will be heavy rewards. If you dare to deceive me, consider it today’s appetizer for the little loach. As for whether my mood might be affected after your truthful answers, well, that was hard to say in the past, but not today. As long as you speak the truth, I will be happy.”

The three maidens, each stunning in their own right, trembled with uncertainty, unsure of what this unpredictable young master intended.

Gu Can asked, “What do you think about becoming a maid? Is it good or bad? If it’s good, how good? If it’s bad, how bad?”

The outer disciple from Shu Ku Island spoke up immediately, “Replying to the young master, for me, this is a tremendous blessing. In the entire Shu Ku Island, not only have I survived, but I also don’t have to live in fear every day. The young master won’t arbitrarily bully or kill us. You don’t know how many young female cultivators from Book Lake want to be near you as a maid.”

The second young woman, from a noble family in Stone Hair Country, hesitated before saying, “I feel it’s neither good nor bad. After all, I’ve gone from being a noble daughter to a maid, but compared to becoming a courtesan in a brothel or a plaything for some crude ruffians, this is much better.”

The last maid, a direct disciple of the Su Lin Island master, coldly stated, “I wish I could cut you into a thousand pieces!”

Gu Can showed no sign of anger as she asked, “Do you know why Su Lin Island is to be destroyed? They dared to secretly collude with the other eight major islands, plotting to besiege Qingxia Island. Do you know how your sect met its end? They were foolish. Among the nine major islands, yours is the closest to Qingxia Island, yet you acted so recklessly. How did your senior brother become a lowly offering to Qingxia Island? You really don’t know? What do you hate me for? Just because I’ve killed more than you and the little loach? You may hate me, but you should at least be a little grateful that I saved you, right? Otherwise, you’d be a plaything under your senior brother’s control now, and you’ve heard about his increasingly revealed bedchamber preferences.”

The maid gritted her teeth, “Grateful? I wish I could serve your eyes as a side dish!”

Gu Can chuckled, “I didn’t really like you before, but now I find you quite interesting. There’s a reward for you—a double portion for being the most entertaining among the three.”

Gu Can waved her hand, “You may all leave now and collect your rewards.”

Gu Can softly asked, “Little loach, do you think I was wrong?”

The little loach, sitting beside her, replied gently, “No, I think both the master and Chen Ping An are not wrong. It’s just that Chen Ping An is... more considerate? But that doesn’t mean the master is wrong.”

Gu Can turned and smiled, “Little loach, you used to be a bit slow, but today you seem so sharp!”

The little loach suddenly looked a bit dispirited, “Master, I’m sorry.”

Gu Can burst into laughter, “What are you sorry for? Are you afraid of Chen Ping An? Look at me; am I afraid of him? I’ve cried and whined, but I still don’t feel embarrassed. What’s there to apologize for?”

The little loach shook its head and perked up.

Gu Can crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow, “I’m not afraid of my own mother, so the only person I fear is Chen Ping An. I think that makes us both quite brave.”

Gu Can suddenly drooped her head, “Little loach, why doesn’t Chen Ping An just close one eye and let the other be? If he keeps lecturing me, I definitely won’t listen to him!”

The little loach shook its head vigorously.

Gu Can pointed a finger, “See? That’s why I know you’re a bit foolish.”

Gu Can muttered to herself, “Chen Ping An is being silly again, trying to give me his most precious things. But this time, it’s not food or clothing, so I’m not really willing to accept it.”

The little loach leaned forward, extending a finger to gently smooth Gu Can’s tightly knitted brows.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 450: The Clerk Arrives on the Island

As dawn broke, a faint light began to paint the horizon.

Chen Ping'an, who hadn’t slept all night, closed the door behind him and stepped out of his residence, intending to take a stroll.

He was quickly followed by Gu Can, dressed in a dark blue python robe.

In the nearby lake of Qingxia Island, a small mudfish revealed its true form and swam leisurely.

Chen Ping'an spoke, "What I said yesterday was meant to make you recognize your mistakes. I later realized that it's not easy. That's fine. What I want to discuss today, I hope you'll remember, because I'm not trying to convince you. I'm just presenting some possibilities that you might not have considered. If you don't want to listen, at least keep it in mind; who knows when it might come in handy. Can you do that?"

Gu Can nodded earnestly. "No problem. I’ve remembered what you said yesterday."

Chen Ping'an picked up a twig, lightly poking the ground as he walked, "In this world, not everyone can be me, Chen Ping'an, nor can everyone be Gu Can. That would be wrong."

"It's precisely because there are good people in this world, many we see and many more we don’t, that you and I can live here today, sharing our respective philosophies."

"Stating this isn’t to prove that you, Gu Can, are necessarily wrong. It's my hope that you understand more about this world, know more. The rivers and lakes are not just contained within the confines of Shujian Lake; one day, you will have to leave this place, just as you left your hometown."

As he spoke, Chen Ping'an stepped off the white jade stone path, heading toward the lake, with Gu Can closely following.

Crouching down, Chen Ping'an used the twig to draw a circle in the dirt. "Let me share a principle I’ve been pondering, which is still a work in progress. It stemmed from listening to a good friend I met in Tongyezhou, who casually mentioned the distinctions between sages, gentlemen, and saints in a Confucian academy."

Gu Can muttered, "Why haven't I met any good friends at Shujian Lake?"

He wished fervently that Chen Ping'an had no friends other than him.

Chen Ping'an chuckled and wrote the word "Sage" (贤人) within the circle. "To become a sage in the Seventy-Two Academies, there are rules. A sage must cultivate knowledge through extensive reading and thoughtful reflection, crafting principles that can benefit an entire nation and its people."

Next, he drew a slightly larger circle and wrote "Gentleman" (君子) inside it. "If a sage's teachings can be applied to a whole continent, they can be considered a gentleman."

Finally, he drew an even larger circle, writing "Saint" (圣人). "Should a gentleman's knowledge expand further to encompass universal principles applicable to the world, they become a saint in the academies."

Chen Ping'an pointed at the three circles. "You see, just looking at these circles suggests that even the Confucian academy emphasizes 'positions.' Sages, gentlemen, and saints each have their own stances. Then, how can ordinary people, officials, soldiers, or even mountain hermits justify speaking of stances without regard for right or wrong? Do you understand why?"

Gu Can shook his head, feeling overwhelmed.

Chen Ping'an continued, "First, having a stance is natural and difficult to avoid, but it doesn’t mean that solely advocating your own position absolves you from all other considerations. That sort of self-justification is narrow-minded. Whether it’s in knowledge or conduct, the essence of one’s standing is interconnected. Sages, gentlemen, and saints are connected, as are common folks and emperors, generals, and cultivators. Therefore, in the orthodox Confucian temples of Zhongtu Shenzhou, the writings of sages throughout history, the greater their wisdom, the more foundational they are, unyielding and profound. I've heard that even so, as time flows on, the golden words of great sages can begin to lose their luster."

Seeing Gu Can grow increasingly puzzled, Chen Ping'an forced a smile. "I thought long and hard about these words last night, intending to share them with you, but really, I was also speaking to myself."

Standing up, he surveyed the surroundings. "Qingxia Island is like a circle, the rules established by Liu Zhimo. To put it more precisely, the place where you and your aunt stay is also a circle, bound by the family rules you both created. Expanding outward, Shujian Lake is yet another circle, shaped by the customs forged through countless lives sacrificed by mountain hermits throughout history. Further still, the central region of Baopingzhou, where Shujian Lake is located, and the Guanhua Academy is another circle. And on an even smaller scale, you, I, and Chen Ping'an represent the smallest circle of all, only governing ourselves. Someone once said that possessing a higher moral standard in the secular world is better for self-regulation."

Chen Ping'an seemed to be lost in thought, leaning on the twig as he murmured, "Do you know what I’m most afraid of? It’s the fear that the reasoning I use to justify myself, to endure grievances in the present, might become my lifelong reasoning. The passage of time, which is ever-present yet hard for us to see, flows like a river. Just as I said earlier, in this irreversible process, many golden words of the sages may also fade into obscurity."

"Yesterday’s reasoning may lose its relevance."

Gu Can suddenly tilted his head and said, "What you're saying today is that you, Chen Ping'an, hope I realize I'm wrong, right?"

Chen Ping'an, however, didn’t answer him and continued, "But I believe that some of the simplest, most fundamental truths, as lowly as those that might lie in our muddy alley, will never change. What was true ten thousand years ago is still true today, and it will remain true ten thousand years from now."

"For instance, when we were on the brink of starvation... I, Chen Ping'an, didn’t think about stealing or robbing. I would open the door for my aunt to give me that bowl of rice, and I’d remember it for a lifetime. Even when someone offered me a stick of candied hawthorn, I would hold back and not reach out for it. You know how I ran while telling myself?"

As long as it didn’t involve admitting his mistakes, Gu Can seemed more interested, curious. "What was it?"

Chen Ping'an gazed into the distance, "If I took it, it would be wrong because at that time, I still had a few copper coins in my pocket. I wouldn’t starve immediately. So I couldn’t take that stick of candied hawthorn, fearing that once I tasted something so delicious, I might find a bowl of rice insufficiently fulfilling in the future. It could make my later days harder, where a mere meal that barely filled me would leave me unsatisfied. Should I go back every day to ask that person for more candied hawthorn? Even if he was willing to give it to me every time, one day his stall would vanish, and then what would I do?"

Chen Ping'an’s expression grew distant. "But you know? At that moment, no reasoning could resist the temptation of that candied hawthorn. I desperately wanted to turn around and tell the vendor, ‘Forget it, just give me a stick.’ You know how I kept myself from turning back?"

He answered his own question, "I told myself, 'Chen Ping'an, Chen Ping'an, don’t be greedy! Maybe one day your father will return, and you can eat your fill then! Father promised that the next time he came home, he would bring candied hawthorn.' So later, when I secretly went back and didn’t see that vendor anymore, I felt a bit sad—not because I missed the free candied hawthorn, but because I worried that if Father came home, he wouldn't be able to buy any."

Gu Can reached out as if to tug at Chen Ping'an's sleeve but hesitated.

Chen Ping'an murmured, "To live, one must have some hopes, right?"

"You think I don't know that my father probably won't return?"

"I know."

"But I still think that way."

"Do you remember as a little snot-nosed kid, wandering the streets at night, always asking me why I wasn’t afraid of ghosts? I wasn’t truly unafraid from the start; one day I thought, if there really are ghosts in this world, wouldn’t that mean I could see my parents? Just thinking that made me braver."

"I just worried a little that if my parents became ghosts, being such good people, would they be bullied by evil spirits? Would that prevent them from coming to see me?"

After saying this, Chen Ping'an turned around and ruffled Gu Can’s hair. "Let me walk alone for a bit. You handle your own matters."

Gu Can nodded, gently stepping away.

After walking a fair distance, Gu Can turned back, suddenly struck by a peculiar thought.

It seemed that Chen Ping'an was no longer as angry or saddened as he had been yesterday.

Yet, he appeared even more… disappointed, though it wasn’t directed at Gu Can.

————

That night, Gu Can noticed that the lights in Chen Ping'an's room were still on, so he knocked on the door.

Chen Ping'an walked around his desk to the main table and asked, "Aren't you going to sleep?"

Gu Can smiled, "Aren't you the same?"

Earlier, Gu Can had seen a pile of densely written papers on the desk, but there wasn’t a single crumpled piece in the trash. He asked, "Practicing calligraphy?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "Just thinking and writing casually. Over the years, I’ve been watching and listening, realizing that my own thoughts are still insufficient."

Gu Can inquired, "Did you come up with anything?"

After pondering, Chen Ping'an replied, "I was just thinking about a saying: The true freedom of the strong in this world should be defined by the boundaries of the weak."

Gu Can rolled his eyes. "What do I count as a strong person, and how old am I right now?"

Chen Ping'an responded, "It relates to a person's age, but not necessarily. I’ve encountered many formidable opponents: the Queen of Dali, an old dragon that was even stronger than the mudfish now, and a cultivator at the Ascendant stage. They can’t be labeled purely as bad people; to many, they are good and virtuous. Yet, at the very least, they don’t grasp this principle."

"This is one of the most valuable truths I hold. You are Gu Can, and I’m sharing this with you. Whether you choose to listen is up to you. But because you are Gu Can, I hope you take it to heart. You’re young, yet you want to protect your mother. That makes you strong—many adults can’t match that."

Gu Can leaned over the table, grinning. "My mother says that when you were young, you did many things for her. She often brings that up, saying I’m ungrateful, that giving birth to me was like raising a white-eyed wolf."

Chen Ping'an slowly said, "Let’s not discuss right and wrong, good and evil for now. If everyone in this world had the same thoughts as you do now, what do you think it would become?"

Gu Can shook his head. "I never think about these things."

Chen Ping'an nodded.

This was, in fact, Gu Can's true sentiment.

Gu Can feared that Chen Ping'an would become angry, so he explained, "I’m just speaking my mind; that’s what Chen Ping'an himself said."

Chen Ping'an then shifted the topic. "If everyone were you, Gu Can, our hometown wouldn’t have Mr. Qi from the school, Mud Bottle Alley wouldn’t have our neighbor, Grandpa Liu, or Grandma Liu, or Uncle Zhao, who often helps your mother harvest rice and fights for water."

"I think it wouldn’t matter if they weren’t there. Whether we have them or not, my mother and I would still survive. At worst, we’d just endure a few more beatings. My mother would get a few more slaps to her face, and I would eventually pay them back one by one. The former, I would repay one by one; gods and wealth? Beautiful women? Whatever I want, I’ll get it!"

"Mud Bottle Alley wouldn’t have me."

Gu Can glared, "That’s not acceptable!"

Chen Ping'an, with a pale face, smiled lightly.

After a moment of silence, Chen Ping'an said, "Gu Can, I know you’ve been truthful with me, which is why I’m willing to sit here. Now for my final question, I hope you can still answer me truthfully."

"Sure!"

"Do you like killing?"

Gu Can hesitated for a moment, but the corners of his mouth slowly curled up, a smile blooming on his face, his eyes sparkling with sincerity as he declared, "Yes!"

Gu Can’s radiant smile was soon accompanied by tears. "Chen Ping'an, I don’t want to lie to you!"

Chen Ping'an smiled as well, reaching out to wipe away Gu Can's tears. "It’s okay. I think I was wrong. My reasoning doesn’t clarify right from wrong, but I’m still Chen Ping'an, and you’re still my little snot-nosed kid."

Gu Can worriedly asked, "Are you angry with me?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "I’m not angry at you."

Gu Can murmured, "But you’re clearly still upset."

Chen Ping'an replied, "I’ll try not to be angry with anyone."

After Gu Can left, Chen Ping'an stood up, walked toward the desk, but paused mid-step.

He was about to turn around and sit down to rest but hesitated again.

So he just stood there.

Chen Ping'an, hands in his sleeves, slightly bent over, began to think.

In the small temple of Nanyuan Kingdom, the old monk once said, "Put down the butcher’s knife, and you shall become a Buddha."

Yet Gu Can did not feel he had done anything wrong; that knife of killing was tightly gripped in Gu Can’s hands, and he had no intention of letting it go.

Thus, the conversations he had with Pei Qian about letting go of yesterday—yesterday’s events were dead, today’s events were alive—were all just empty talk.

It’s easy to conquer thieves in the mountains, but hard to conquer the thief in one’s heart.

Now, Chen Ping'an felt that this "thief of the heart," on Gu Can's side, had also made its way to his own side, pushing open the doors of his heart and settling in. It couldn’t be killed or driven away.

Because he couldn’t get past his own heart's barrier.

Gu Can was the one person he would never abandon.

The great sword immortal known as Chen Qingdu once said that in this life, one should reason everywhere, in everything, to occasionally forsake reason.

But Chen Ping'an knew that even this elder sword immortal, despite his outward indifference to reasoning, still harbored those principles deep within his heart. It was just that even an elder sword immortal like him had moments when reasoning fell short, leaving him with no choice but to draw his sword.

Chen Ping'an felt a sense of confusion.

He suddenly realized he had shared all the reasoning he knew in this lifetime, possibly even all the reasoning he wished to share with others in the future.

————

In the tall buildings of Poolwater City, Cui Dongshan muttered, "It’s hard to persuade a deadbeat with good advice!"

Cui Zhan smiled. "The beauty of great principles lies in people like Gu Can; they can stand out more than so-called mediocre good people."

Cui Dongshan turned and glared at Cui Zhan. "You haven’t secretly protected Gu Can? Are you deliberately inciting him to create chaos?"

Cui Zhan countered, "If I had someone successfully assassinate Gu Can’s mother and then obstruct Chen Ping'an's journey south, wouldn’t it just lead to a bigger dead end when Ruan Xiu inadvertently harmed Gu Can? But do I need to arrange things this way? I don’t. Naturally, doing so would detract from the nuances of timing and diminish the most intriguing and subtle atmosphere, leaving Chen Ping'an with fewer paths to choose from. It seems narrower and more like a dead end, but it might easily push him to extremes. Should he revert to his true self, he could either punch or stab Gu Can to death, or simply end it all himself. This dead end would merely take a life, but what would be the significance? Even if there were some significance, it wouldn’t be great enough. You wouldn’t be convinced, and I wouldn’t feel victorious."

Cui Dongshan looked despondent.

Suddenly, he erupted in anger, "Cui Dongshan, what did Chen Ping'an do wrong?!"

Cui Zhan sighed with a smile. "Isn’t that childish?"

Cui Dongshan shouted, "You tell me!"

Cui Zhan grinned, tilting his head slightly, as if waiting for an answer. "To the most revered sage, the sage of propriety, you both possess the greatest knowledge. Come, come, come, let’s hear what you have to say."

Cui Dongshan fell silent.

Cui Zhan continued with a smile, "The situation is set. Now, the only thing I want to know is what you wrote in that small pouch of yours? 'No partiality, only truth'?"

Cui Dongshan, lost and dazed, shook his head. "It’s not from the Legalist school."

Cui Zhan nodded. "Then it seems it’s not from Buddhism either."

Cui Dongshan was bewildered. "It’s not knowledge from any of the three teachings or any of the myriad principles."

Cui Zhan frowned.

————

Chen Ping'an trembled as he reached into his sleeve and pulled out the small pouch—a parting gift from Pei Qian before they left Hongzhu Town—saying that he should definitely open it when he felt the angriest.

Chen Ping'an opened the pouch and took out a piece of paper.

It read, "Chen Ping'an, please do not lose hope in this world."

After reading it, Chen Ping'an tucked it back into the pouch and returned it to his sleeve.

He turned to gaze out at the night sky, murmuring, "I’m just very disappointed in myself."

————

Inside the tall building, Cui Zhan laughed heartily.

Cui Dongshan felt like his heart was dead.

Cui Zhan’s laughter rang out joyfully, a sense of fulfillment washing over him.

This great national teacher of Dali, Cui Zhan, hadn’t felt this exhilarated in a long time.

Cui Dongshan was about to rise and step out of the golden thunder pool he had drawn around himself.

Suddenly, Cui Zhan squinted his eyes.

In the painted scroll, Chen Ping'an reached for the sword-raising gourd and downed all the wine in one go.

Then he took out the golden robe of law and stood still as the robe magically adorned itself upon him.

Chen Ping'an then retrieved a purification talisman and pressed it against a beam in the room.

He closed his eyes.

Using the internal vision of a cultivator, Chen Ping'an sent his consciousness to the entrance of the mansion where the golden literary brush resided.

The door slowly opened.

After successfully refining this second life-bound object, the golden-clad small figure who carried a sword and hung books had told Chen Ping'an a phrase even Mao Xiaodong couldn’t decipher.

"To recognize one’s mistakes and correct them is the greatest virtue."

That was actually the deep-seated concern Chen Ping'an harbored for Gu Can, a hint to himself that mistakes should be acknowledged. Just because someone isn’t close to me, Chen Ping'an, doesn’t mean I should deem them blameless or show favoritism; rather, those mistakes can be earnestly amended.

However, so many lives had been lost.

Gu Can would not admit his mistakes.

Now, how could he make amends?

Right and wrong lay bare before him, and Chen Ping'an could not afford to make exceptions or deceive himself.

What many people do and say is not necessarily right.

The mansion door slowly opened.

Chen Ping'an bowed farewell to the golden-clad small figure.

Originally, the golden literary brush, which had already formed the embryo of the Golden Core and was poised to achieve the "moral embodiment" realm, that small figure in golden robes, despite countless words to say, could only sigh, bowing in respect just like Chen Ping'an.

With a loud bang, the entire small universe echoed like a mournful bell, resonating throughout the heavens and earth.

The golden literary brush shattered with a loud crash, and the once-shiny longsword of the golden-clad small figure, along with its dimmed books and its very essence, melted away like snow, never to be seen again.

In this residence on Qingxia Island, a whiff of blood filled the air.

Chen Ping'an stumbled and fell to the ground, sitting cross-legged.

He struggled to rise, pushing aside all the papers, and began writing letters, crafting three of them.

————

Cui Dongshan’s eyes turned cold. "I’ve lost."

A long silence followed.

Cui Dongshan, somewhat puzzled, turned to look.

Cui Zhan, however, appeared as if facing a great enemy, sitting upright with a serious expression!

————

The next day, a peculiar figure suddenly appeared on Qingxia Island.

First, he sent three secret letters via flying sword.

As for the contents of the letters and their recipients, this person was a distinguished guest of Gu Can, who would dare to pry?

The three letters were sent to Wei Bo of Longquan County, Zhong Kui of Tongyezhou, and Fan Junmao of Old Dragon City.

He inquired if there were any shortcuts to quickly master the celestial techniques of consolidating souls and spirits. He sought knowledge on how a person becomes a ghost after death or the intricacies of reincarnation. He also asked if there were any long-lost ancient secrets that could summon the “ancestors” from the underworld to assist the living in conversing with them.

Afterward, this individual requested a small room near the mountain gate of Qingxia Island.

On the table lay writing materials and an ordinary abacus.

This person appeared young, but his demeanor was slack, his complexion pale, though he kept himself tidy and clean. Regardless of who looked at him, his eyes sparkled with brightness.

He requested all files of the cultivators and servants from Qingxia Island from Lord Tianhu.

Like a… clerk?  
*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 451: Setting Aside the Teachings of the Book (Part One)

Today, the area around Book Simple Lake and Qingxia Island was calm and serene; the lake's surface shimmered like a mirror. Surrounding it were numerous large and small vassal islands, their green hills layered in shades of emerald. Occasionally, the sound of cranes from celestial abodes pierced the air, and from a distance, one could hear the faint rumble of thunder, with rainbows occasionally streaking across the sky.

The scenery was enchanting, a realm fit for immortals.

The senior sister, Tian Hujun, donned a bright red silk half-sleeve robe, intricately embroidered with auspicious cloud patterns in gold thread. She walked gracefully, cradling a stack of files, making her way to the building near the main entrance of Qingxia Island. Along the way, all the cultivators who encountered her stepped aside, bowing in respect to the beautiful female cultivator.

Tian Hujun offered no response.

She was now a powerful figure on Qingxia Island. In recent years, the island had seen a remarkable rise in strength, largely thanks to her efforts alongside her master, Liu Zhimo, and her junior brother, Gu Can, as they engaged in numerous battles. The continuous bloodshed honed their skills, and the subsequent rewards were abundant. Furthermore, with Liu Zhimo's generous gifts, Tian Hujun successfully attained the Golden Core Earth Immortal status last autumn. A grand feast was held on Qingxia Island to celebrate her becoming a Golden Core guest, marking her entry into the realm of immortals.

Upon reaching the door of the designated room, Tian Hujun knocked and entered, finding a young man seated at a desk, looking up at her.

The young man, adorned with a hairpin and clad in a blue long gown, had a vermilion wine gourd placed beside him on the table. Having visited this place frequently, Tian Hujun, now a Golden Core Earth Immortal, discerned that the wine gourd was no ordinary item; it was likely a magical artifact obscured by illusions, indicating it belonged to a highly skilled individual. Such a concealed object was undoubtedly a genuine top-tier treasure, probably a Sword-raising Gourd.

Tian Hujun had previously engaged in a private discussion with her master, Liu Zhimo, regarding the wine gourd. His confirmation validated her suspicions; it was indeed a top-quality Sword-raising Gourd.

However, what truly unsettled Tian Hujun was not the gourd used by the young man but rather the long sword left in the adjacent room where her junior brother, Gu Can, resided. Liu Zhimo had asserted that it was a rebellious semi-immortal weapon.

Liu Zhimo instructed Tian Hujun to keep a tight rein on all the cultivators of Qingxia Island during this period, at least until Chen Pingan departed from Book Simple Lake. They were not to act as they usually did, with reckless abandon.

It was the first time Tian Hujun sensed a strange concept called "constraint" emanating from her master, Liu Zhimo.

Stepping into the room, the young man had already risen to clear a space on the table.

Tian Hujun gently placed the long-sealed stack of files onto the desk and apologized, “Mr. Chen, this is the third batch of secret documents retrieved from Qingxia Island's incense room. The incense room has been neglected for quite some time, accustomed to the comfortable days without oversight, hence the poor preservation and significant insect damage. I apologize for this.”

Chen Pingan waved his hand dismissively. “I hope Master Tian does not punish the incense room over this. It was your kindness and that of the incense room in assisting me. What do you think, Master Tian?”

Tian Hujun had initially intended to reprimand the three in charge of the incense room, but upon seeing Chen Pingan's expression and demeanor, she immediately abandoned the idea. Perhaps a private lesson would suffice? With the recent tranquility of Book Simple Lake, the cultivators of Qingxia Island had grown restless, accustomed to the tumultuous years of bloodshed. Tian Hujun, once an inconsequential disciple under the Jiangjiang True Monarch, had been declared by a renowned Yin-Yang master visiting Qingxia Island as someone who would never reach Earth Immortal status. Yet, she had risen to power, controlling a territory gained through conquest—Mei Immortal Island. In the context of Book Simple Lake, it was akin to being a feudal lord, possessing a domain that truly belonged to her, Tian Hujun. The fair and firm rewards and punishments of the Jiangjiang True Monarch were the bedrock for Liu Zhimo's ability to establish Qingxia Island's dominance in Book Simple Lake. Liu Zhimo was not stingy with rewards for “loyal ministers”; newcomers or those who surrendered, as long as they fought bravely and contributed to Qingxia Island, were treated equally by the rewards from the ancestral hall of Qingxia Island.

Chen Pingan remarked, “I may need to visit the incense room administrator soon to inquire about a few matters. If you could help me convey that to Master Tian.”

Tian Hujun felt a chill run down her spine but smiled brightly. “Mr. Chen is too polite; this is my duty, and it is also an honor for the incense room.”

Chen Pingan fell silent, seeing that Tian Hujun did not seem inclined to leave just yet, he spoke softly, “Is there something you wish to discuss, Master Tian?”

Tian Hujun carefully constructed her words in her mind before saying, “My master wants me to ask Mr. Chen whether you will participate in the upcoming nomination for the Jianghu lord on Gongliu Island?”

Chen Pingan replied, “This is a great opportunity that your Qingxia Island has worked hard to win, and it is your own matter in Book Simple Lake. Naturally, I won't interfere, but I will observe the spectacle from here.”

Tian Hujun breathed a sigh of relief. The response from this account holder, who left most of Qingxia Island's cultivators in confusion, was satisfactory. She should be able to report it back to her master, Liu Zhimo.

Chen Pingan walked around the desk and escorted Tian Hujun to the door.

Though this was a routine occurrence, Tian Hujun felt a sense of being undeservedly favored. After walking away, she pondered privately—was it possible that Mr. Chen Pingan had realized the significance of the Sword-raising Gourd and that rebellious semi-immortal weapon?

Returning to his desk, Chen Pingan began to sift through the incense room files.

Names, places of origin, dates of birth, masters, relatives, and families.

Many names had been crossed out in red ink according to the old rules of the incense room, a process known as “cancellation of records.”

For every name Chen Pingan sought, he wrote it down in a blank book without printed text nearby, noting not only the place of birth but also the positions these individuals had held on Qingxia Island. The files of the incense room varied in thickness based on the cultivator's level—higher cultivation corresponded to more detailed records. For those of lower cultivation, the record would consist of little more than a name and place of origin, often fewer than ten words.

There were also many deceased individuals whose names had never appeared in the incense room's records; once they died, not even a name remained.

Next, Chen Pingan planned to visit the incense room to inquire about the individuals he had noted, seeking their reputations and general impressions from others. He also intended to follow leads from the various cultivators of Qingxia Island, the estate managers, and the gossiping young women, to gather those names and record them one by one. During this time, he might even have to trouble Tian Hujun to assist with some of the prominent figures on Qingxia Island. Currently, Chen Pingan was not inclined to expend too much effort on this; however, he was wary of wasting time on the journey back and forth.

On her way to report this matter to Liu Zhimo, Tian Hujun happened to encounter her junior brother, Gu Can, clad in a robe resembling a dragon's shed skin.

As for the other junior brothers and sisters, including Qin Jue and Chao Zhe, as well as the ten esteemed guest disciples residing across the twelve major islands of Qingxia, Meixian, and Sulin, the core members and capable hands of Qingxia Island were under increasing pressure as the alliance meeting on Gongliu Island drew near. The higher-ups of Qingxia Island were relaxed on the surface but tense within, needing to act as if they were the Jiangjiang True Monarch, playing the role of negotiators, much like strategists who scouted alliances, employing conspiracies and grand strategies without hesitation.

Gu Can greeted Tian Hujun with a grin, still exuding the demeanor of a youthful farmer with hands tucked into the sleeves of his ink-blue robe. “Senior sister, visiting Mr. Chen Pingan again? Let me give you a friendly reminder: don’t have any misguided thoughts about climbing into Mr. Chen’s bed one day, or else you might hear me call you ‘sister-in-law’! Otherwise, when the time comes, I’ll forget all about our brotherhood.”

Tian Hujun smiled wryly. “Junior brother, I’m not bewitched. Besides, does Mr. Chen look at someone like me, a mere willow twig?”

Gu Can chuckled, “Of course he does! Mr. Chen Pingan has discerning eyes; back then, he didn't even glance at a girl from the neighbor's house named Zhi Gui. I'm glad to see you have such self-awareness, senior sister.”

While chatting with Gu Can, Tian Hujun would subtly lower her posture, ensuring that Gu Can wouldn’t have to look up or raise his gaze. Over time, it became natural.

Gu Can continued, “And about the young lady from the open-collared dress, you must keep a tight lid on that. If others let something slip, it’s their foolishness, but if someone as clever as you, senior sister, makes a mistake, I might have to suspect your intentions. If that day comes, I’m not sure Master could protect you like he did with the senior brother back then.”

Tian Hujun’s smile faltered. “You’re not unaware of the senior sister’s character, are you?”

Gu Can nodded. “Precisely because I’m aware, I have to remind you, senior sister. Otherwise, one day, due to a few scraps of food from Master, you might lose your life right under my watch. If you don’t regret it, I, as your junior brother who has cared for you for so many years, would have to lament your loss.”

Tian Hujun sighed, “I’ll remember that.”

Gu Can gently patted Tian Hujun’s cheek. “Go on, Master is waiting for your news.”

After Tian Hujun left, Gu Can turned to the little mudfish and said, “It’s not fitting to keep calling you little mudfish. Let’s go to Mr. Chen Pingan and get you a name.”

The little mudfish squirmed shyly.

Gu Can laughed. “It’s not your real name; what’s there to be afraid or shy about?”

On the way to the room, Gu Can frowned and asked, “That night, the commotion in Mr. Chen Pingan's house, was it really just a mishap in cultivating Qi?”

The little mudfish shook its head. Now, as a Nascent Soul, it observed the qi-cultivating matters of the Fifth Realm cultivators from a higher vantage point, saying, “It’s definitely not that simple; it’s only slightly better than going berserk. The exact cause is hard to say. Mr. Chen Pingan is fundamentally a pure martial artist and is currently rebuilding the Longevity Bridge, which is quite different from us, so I can’t discern the truth. However, Mr. Chen Pingan was seriously injured that night, and the master noticed it too—not just in body and soul, but also in his state of mind…”

The little mudfish dared not say more.

Gu Can halted, falling into silence.

An oppressive aura emanated from him.

This little scourge of Book Simple Lake, known for instilling fear in others, hadn’t solely relied on the little mudfish and Liu Zhimo to reach this point.

Gu Can forced a smile. “Then what do you suggest as a remedy?”

The girl-like little mudfish with skin as white as feathers scratched its head. “Mr. Chen Pingan hasn’t said anything himself; perhaps the master shouldn’t overthink it? You’re always joking about those ants trapped in a desperate situation, making mistakes due to acting rashly, right?”

Gu Can nodded. “That makes sense.”

Upon reaching Chen Pingan’s modest room, Gu Can grabbed a small stool and sat on the threshold, cheerfully explaining the purpose of his visit, hoping to help the little mudfish come up with a name that didn’t relate to worldly monsters or dragon-like beings.

Chen Pingan set down his brush, raised his head, and pondered for a moment. “Let’s name it Charcoal Snow. Charcoal and snow share the same hearth, close and precious to one another.”

Gu Can vigorously nodded, smiling at the little mudfish. “What do you think?!”

The little mudfish blushed. “It’s a bit too elegant for me; I haven’t studied much, will it be a joke?”

Gu Can chuckled. “Who would dare mock your true name? I’ll…”

Before Gu Can could finish, he promptly shut his mouth and turned his head.

He noticed Chen Pingan had already resumed his writing, focusing intently.

Gu Can basked in the gentle autumn sun for a while, feeling too comfortable and nearly dozing off.

Sitting on the small stool, with Chen Pingan behind him at the desk, Gu Can felt no fear, even if the sky fell.

Gu Can stretched lazily and turned to ask, “My mother said she’ll cook dinner tonight, making an even more authentic home-style dish than last time. Do you want to come?”

Chen Pingan nodded. “Please thank Auntie for me. I’ll hurry over when it’s time for dinner. And tell her I won’t be drinking this time.”

Gu Can beamed. “Alright! I’ll get busy then!”

As Gu Can placed the small stool back in the corner, Chen Pingan suddenly said, “Tell Tian Hujun that I want to gather local chronicles of Book Simple Lake. In addition to the treasured books held by each island, I may also need to look into the records of Chishui City nearby, and even those of more distant prefectures and counties. All expenses, no matter how much spirit money, will be covered by me. Also, remind her to factor in any premiums outside the official quote, including human and material resources from Qingxia Island. Let’s conduct business fairly. I believe Book Simple Lake won’t be unfamiliar with this.”

Gu Can laughed. “A small matter! Now that Qingxia Island has gathered a bunch of cunning folks who only know how to cheer but not contribute, it’s just right to send them out to do some legitimate work.”

Chen Pingan regarded Gu Can with a thoughtful expression.

Gu Can considered. “I’ll make sure to clarify that we’re conducting business fairly and won’t use Qingxia Island’s name to overpower others or act recklessly.”

Chen Pingan replied, “If anything unexpected arises, let me know immediately, and I’ll handle it myself.”

Gu Can smiled brightly. “Don’t worry; there won’t be any surprises. This is Qingxia Island, Book Simple Lake—there are many rules, and while many people enjoy breaking them, they all understand the price of doing so; everyone has their own accounts to keep.”

Gu Can and the little mudfish departed from the Qingxia Island gate.

Suddenly, Gu Can remarked, “Little mudfish, why do I feel that Mr. Chen Pingan’s last glance was a bit strange? Were you frightened at that moment?”

The little mudfish timidly admitted, “A little.”

Gu Can swaggered, “I told you, Mr. Chen Pingan is suitable for staying here in Book Simple Lake. With him around, I’m only afraid of him, but I can truly be fearless. Who do you think benefits more from this deal? Of course, it’s me!”

The little mudfish smiled shyly. “Charcoal Snow agrees with you.”

Gu Can turned his head to see the little mudfish twisting its clothes nervously. He laughed and scolded, “You little shameless girl! Earlier you said it was too elegant, and now you’re quick to use the name?”

Gu Can suddenly wore a mournful expression. “But little mudfish, we have to be careful lately. No more reckless fighting like before; even though Mr. Chen Pingan has taken on the role of account holder, he’s still watching us.”

The little mudfish patted its stomach. “Not hungry for now.”

Gu Can rolled his eyes. “After just eating that Golden Core woman’s food, if you say you’re hungry again, who do you think I’ll catch for you? My master?”

The little mudfish’s eyes sparkled.

Gu Can chuckled, hands tucked into his sleeves, raising his head. “Little mudfish, I’m very happy—happier than when I kill someone.”

The little mudfish copied him, recently learning to be “open and honest,” saying, “Before being hungry, master is happy, and I’m happy too.”

Gu Can asked, “What do you think Mr. Chen Pingan is plotting?”

The little mudfish shook its head. “I don’t dare to approach Mr. Chen Pingan and the desk; I don’t like to think about things, so I don’t know.”

Gu Can sighed. “It doesn’t matter; as long as I can see Mr. Chen Pingan every day, what else is there to be dissatisfied about?”

 ### Chapter 452: Setting Aside the Principles for Now (Part 2)

Inside the tall buildings of Pool Water City.

Recently, Cui Dongshan had begun to stand up, often pacing within the golden Thunder Pool.

In contrast, Cui Chen had started to close his eyes in deep concentration. Occasionally, he would receive messages from the highest-ranking flying swords, requiring him to personally address matters concerning the military and political affairs relevant to the Great Li's trajectory.

Cui Dongshan stood at the edge of a circular area, gazing down at two scrolls. One depicted the actions and words of Gu Can and his maid, Little Mud Eel, while the other illustrated the interior of the accountant Chen Ping'an's residence.

Cui Dongshan began to comment on Gu Can: “Those with protruding bones die young; those with exposed bones cannot stand; those with horizontal bones possess a fierce spirit; those whose bones resemble gold and stone have extremely tough lives. Hey, old bastard, do you think Gu Can, if he were to leave the Li Pearl Cave and never see Chen Ping'an again, could rely solely on himself to become the second top-tier cultivator in the Treasure Bottle Continent after Liu Lao Cheng of Bee Tail Ferry?”

Cui Chen opened his eyes and nodded, “The possibility is extremely high. In a chaotic world, Gu Can finds himself swimming with the current.”

Cui Dongshan smiled, “Old bastard, what do you say to this? Although my master is gravely injured, his vitality severely impacted, the deadlock isn’t dead enough. Are you more disappointed than my master? Haha, you went through great lengths to arrange the Four Difficulties, and in the end, my master conceded on the third difficulty regarding his true heart. Since deep down he believes Gu Can's actions are still wrong, he can neither crush Gu Can with one punch nor abandon him. So, he crossed over the hurdle of his true heart and resolutely shattered the second piece of his life’s treasure that he had painstakingly refined. Not only did this turn your first two difficulties into jokes, but my master also managed to make a clean break and choose a path with the least divergence, temporarily setting aside emotions and laws, no longer nitpicking over principles. Instead, he began to trace back to the origins and, while contemplating the chain of events, for the first time, he attempted to step out of his ‘error-free’ circle. It’s as if he broke through a barrier, no longer confined by principles, and started to venture into the vast world, with thoughts reaching everywhere!”

Cui Chen responded off-topic, “I heard that you’ve taken up the techniques of the arithmetic arts that we discarded years ago, and started to delve into the intricacies of the Vein Block?”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “A small achievement, nothing much to mention. It pales in comparison to the grand plans you’ve devised, old bastard.”

Cui Chen sneered, “If you want to say something, just say it. Why hold back? Do you really think I’m begging you to reveal those newly realized profound principles?”

Cui Dongshan rubbed his hands together, “Since the old bastard is looking for ways to coax me, then I’ll… just share an interesting story. I believe you’d be curious too. Let me ask you, Cui Lao Wang, don’t you want to know how my master passed the tests of his future in-laws during the trip to the Upside-Down Mountain? I can give you a hint—it has a bit to do with Gu Can.”

Cui Chen remained indifferent, “Back at the Bamboo Tower on the Desolate Mountain, my grandfather mentioned that Chen Ping'an faced the greatest peril at the Upside-Down Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall, as he could break through two realms in one breath, directly reaching the pinnacle of the sixth realm of martial arts. It's something a deep-minded fellow like Chen Ping'an would certainly have considered. From the current signs, it seems he has managed to control his martial intent to such an extent that the situation in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land might not be enough. Most likely, during the test conducted by the future in-laws, hmm, there’s a tavern selling Yellow Millet Wine at the Upside-Down Mountain. Those who drink it become carefree, which means that at that time, Chen Ping'an must have already entered the sixth realm. How he achieved that, and how he returned to his original realm, is hard to say. The world is full of wonders, and there’s an old master of miscellaneous studies who has been selling wine for many years, but that’s neither here nor there. Even if Chen Ping'an ascended to become an Earth Immortal, I wouldn't be surprised. So, how did he pass that test? It’s simple. Two sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall disguised themselves as bystanders in the Yellow Millet Blessed Land tavern, deliberately provoking Chen Ping'an, making him hot-blooded enough to forsake his martial future just to speak up for his beloved's parents.”

Cui Dongshan chuckled, “You old bastard, you’re still impressive. But be careful with your words in the future; my master’s depth isn’t simply about being deep-minded. It’s more about thinking too much and gaining wisdom, while we are both born with a belly full of bad intentions, but that’s a different matter altogether.”

Cui Chen scoffed, “I estimate everyone at the Sword Qi Great Wall thinks Chen Ping'an isn’t worthy of Ning Yao.”

Cui Dongshan was puzzled, “Old bastard, what’s going on with you? Why are you saying good things about my master? Are you thinking of surrendering half? If that’s your intention, fine, let’s just consider it a draw?”

Cui Chen continued, “It was only by being willing to forsake his martial path back then that Chen Ping'an was able to pass the test at the Upside-Down Mountain. If, even now, he is unwilling to stay for Gu Can, how could he have the qualifications to enter this situation? We’ve seen so many smart people who, today, refuse to let go, thinking they can give up more tomorrow.”

Cui Dongshan became increasingly confused, “Cui Chen, are you saying good things about my master again? You can’t be going crazy, can you? Don’t do this; if you’re really losing your mind, wait until after that big matter is completed. At that time, I can set up a small feeding bowl for you at the Bamboo Tower on Desolate Mountain…”

Cui Chen pointed at the room depicted in the scrolls and turned to look at Cui Dongshan, smirking coldly, “What did I tell you earlier? The fourth difficulty lies in countless difficulties. Do you know? The fourth difficulty has only just begun. The more serious Chen Ping'an is now, the more burdens he will accumulate later. At that time, I estimate you will be begging me to surrender half as you worry whether Chen Ping'an will completely lose himself in madness.”

Cui Dongshan no longer pretended to be relaxed, sitting back in place, slowly saying, “Victory and defeat in a moment depend on strength; victory and defeat through the ages depend on reason.”

Cui Chen laughed, “What if this ‘moment’ stretches into decades, a century? What would you do? And what would Chen Ping'an do?”

Cui Dongshan regarded him sternly, “You should learn from my master, understanding how to treat the world well. And I, Cui Dongshan, am one among the mortals, so don’t be so aggressive here.”

Cui Chen smiled slightly, “Ruan Xiu and her entourage are entering the fray. The owner of Gong Liu Island, who has been nearly forgotten by Book Scroll Lake, Liu Lao Cheng, will soon join as well. Perhaps, it’s better to arrive late than to arrive early.”

Cui Dongshan shook his head vigorously, “Not listening, not listening, that old bastard is chanting.”

Cui Chen continued, “This is the price of reasoning. In Mud Bottle Alley, a certain Mud Eel was needlessly given away, while Jiao Long Ditch lost Qi Jingchun’s mountain seal. In Old Dragon City, there was almost a fatal sword thrust from Du Mao. It seems your master hasn’t yet suffered enough hardships; the price isn’t great enough. No matter, this time at Book Scroll Lake, he can feast until he’s stuffed.”

Cui Dongshan still sat there, swaying back and forth, “Not listening, not listening, that old bastard is chanting; the old bastard’s chanting is the worst.”

Cui Chen turned his head, looking at this “young Cui Chen,” “If you get the chance to return to the Desolate Mountain, remember to treat your grandfather better. If I were your grandfather, seeing you like this, I would have killed you back then.”

Cui Dongshan not only shook his rear but also began to wave his two white sleeves.

Cui Chen muttered to himself, “Are you trying to push yourself to death on a dead-end road?”

————

When Chen Ping'an set down his brush, he suddenly noticed the sun outside.

After a moment’s thought, he stepped out of the house and began to sun dry those bamboo slips.

Many of the bamboo slips had writing on both sides, not because there wasn’t enough bamboo available. After traveling thousands of miles, one naturally wouldn’t lack encounters with bamboo forests.

It was just that, having read extensively at that time, he discovered many principles. Even though the different schools of thought have various textual contexts, some paired phrases on a single bamboo slip still felt somewhat “familiar.” Within Confucianism, though the contexts differ, they still felt like direct lineage. The three teachings differ but seem like close neighbors, while the various other schools of thought outside the three teachings resemble transient friends in the Jianghu or distant relatives who haven’t interacted for years.

While drying the bamboo slips, Chen Ping'an picked one up. The front bore the Confucian saying, “Things have their roots and branches; events have their beginnings and ends. Knowing the order of things leads one closer to the Dao.”

The reverse side displayed the Daoist saying, “Heaven and earth possess great beauty, yet do not speak; the four seasons have clear laws, yet do not discuss; all things have their established principles, yet do not speak of them.”

This particular bamboo slip was special. After looking through Buddhist scriptures, Chen Ping'an had inscribed a smaller script on the margin of one side with a Buddhist saying, “The profound truths of all Buddhas are beyond words.”

One bamboo slip bore the inscriptions “A gentleman focuses on the root; when the root is established, the Dao emerges,” and on the reverse, the Buddhist saying, “There are no fixed laws; the Tathagata can speak.”

He picked it up, recited it silently, and gently set it down.

Chen Ping'an then picked up another slip, which read, “The law is equal, with no high or low,” and “People have south and north, but Buddha-nature knows no south or north,” with the reverse stating, “The rulers and ministers, the high and low, are all governed by the law.”

Lastly, he picked up a slip with the front reading, “There is no greater sorrow than a dead heart; death follows.” The reverse read, “When in poverty, one changes; when one changes, one finds a way; when one finds a way, one endures.”

The autumn was crisp, and the sun shone brightly.

After drying all the bamboo slips, Chen Ping'an squatted in a blank space that seemed to be the center, his hands tucked into his sleeves, surveying the surroundings.

He remained squatting like this until the sun cast a slanted light on the mountain, and only then did Chen Ping'an begin to collect the bamboo slips, putting them away in a compact space.

So many principles from books, he thought to set aside for now.

Principles exist in books; being exists outside of them.

This saying was something Chen Ping'an had understood even before the Li Pearl Cave shattered and fell. It wasn’t derived from books, but rather something he learned earnestly from someone else’s serious teachings.

Just as Chen Ping'an finished putting away all the bamboo slips, he saw Gu Can approaching with Little Mud Eel, waving at him.

Chen Ping'an closed the door and walked towards Gu Can, heading together to the grand mansion that was as wealthy as a king.

Two vividly painted guardian deities were posted on the entrance.

As Chen Ping'an looked at them, he murmured, “They can ward off ghosts but cannot stop people.”

Gu Can asked, “What’s wrong?”

Then he slightly complained, “You just had to move to live by the mountain gate, where even proper guardian deities can’t be hung up. How shabby.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Let’s eat.”

When they reached the dining table, he discovered that Gu Can’s mother had already poured wine for both Chen Ping'an and Gu Can.

Little Mud Eel sat beside Gu Can. Although it didn’t particularly enjoy this food, it liked sitting here, dining with the mother and son, making it feel more human.

Gu Can had actually agreed with his mother not to drink wine tonight, feeling somewhat anxious, fearing that Chen Ping'an might get angry.

However, he saw Chen Ping'an had already lifted his cup, toasting a glass to Auntie. Not only that, but he also poured himself a glass, took a sip, and began to serve dishes.

During the meal, the women chatted about trivial and amusing anecdotes from the past regarding the Li Pearl Cave. Chen Ping'an didn’t remain silent the entire time; he shared lively stories about the current happenings in Longquan County as well.

The atmosphere was warm and joyous.

After Gu Can finished one cup of wine, he felt as if he could drink thousands of pounds without getting drunk.

Unexpectedly, Chen Ping'an splashed cold water on him, “You’re still young. Even if you’re a Qi practitioner now, the Crow Cry Wine can benefit your cultivation, but you should still drink less. If you’re really happy, just have three cups.”

Gu Can made a face and nodded in agreement.

The women chuckled behind their hands.

If Chen Ping'an could take more care of Gu Can in these trivial matters, she would certainly appreciate it.

Especially after Little Mud Eel inadvertently mentioned the “I Nurture the Mighty Qi” jade tablet incident, the woman pondered alone for half the night, thinking it was a good thing. At the very least, it could make Liu Zhimou wary. As long as Chen Ping'an had the strength to protect himself, it meant that Gu Can wouldn’t be dragged down, right? As for the convoluted rights and wrongs, she found it tiresome to listen to. She didn’t believe Chen Ping'an would intentionally harm Gu Can. As long as he didn’t do good deeds that turned bad and wasn’t the type to act recklessly, she could allow Chen Ping'an to stay on Qingxia Island.

After the meal, Chen Ping'an began his usual routine of wandering alone along the lakeside path of Qingxia Island.

He walked and stopped, aimlessly.

Occasionally, he would encounter some young, low-ranking Qi practitioners from Qingxia Island, and as for the servants and maids, they naturally didn’t dare to wander away from their respective mansions.

Whenever they saw Chen Ping'an, they would call out to him as “Mr. Chen,” for they had no idea of this young man’s background. They only knew he was a distinguished guest personally invited to Qingxia Island by Gu Can. Moreover, Gu Can visited the house by the mountain gate every day to chat with this guest, which was an unprecedented rarity.

However, when that accountant treated everyone kindly, it made people puzzled, diminishing much of their respect.

Could he be just a facade? Perhaps he was a fellow countryman of the mischievous Gu Can? Or maybe a distant relative of that lady?

Chen Ping'an walked along the quiet path and stopped.

Before him stood two people: Gu Can’s senior brother, Chao Zhe, and Lu Cai Sang, a handsome young man dressed in white snow, who received Gu Can’s favor. Though nearly thirty years old, he retained the youthful demeanor and appearance of a teenager. He must have entered the cave-dwelling realm in his early teens, allowing him to maintain a youthful appearance. This showed that the rare old Nascent Soul cultivator from Book Scroll Lake had a keen eye for talent in taking Lu Cai Sang as a closed-door disciple.

Lu Cai Sang left Chao Zhe, who had already stopped, and stepped forward a few paces, his expression dark. “You’re Chen Ping'an? I advise you to refrain from giving Gu Can a hard time in the future!”

Chen Ping'an directly asked, “What if I don’t?”

Lu Cai Sang was momentarily taken aback, just as he was about to speak.

Chen Ping'an’s gaze had already passed over Lu Cai Sang, looking at Chao Zhe, who considered himself an outsider. After hesitating for a moment, he uttered a strange remark, “Forget it, I won’t hold it against you this time.”

Chao Zhe hesitated.

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “No need to explain; I understand. I just don’t want to hear it.”

Lu Cai Sang looked at the pale, shadowy young man and scoffed, “What an audacious tone! Is it Gu Can who gave you this courage?”

Like a sickly figure, Chen Ping'an extended an arm horizontally.

Chao Zhe instinctively wanted to step back but didn’t want to show fear in front of Lu Cai Sang, forcing himself to remain composed.

The world fell silent.

Lu Cai Sang laughed heartily, “What are you trying to do?”

Chen Ping'an frowned, muttering to himself, “Not coming? You better think it through.”

Upon finishing his words, a golden thread shot up from Gu Can’s residence, stretching upward continuously until a long sword hovered just above the young man’s palm.

Even as the flying sword hovered just an inch above his hand, it remained still.

Yet the golden thread trailing from the sword’s path did not dissipate.

Lu Cai Sang narrowed his eyes.

He was deeply shaken inside.

Chen Ping'an asked, “According to the rules of Book Scroll Lake, aren’t you two supposed to be dead now?”

Chen Ping'an glanced at the sword, which was slightly trembling, and said calmly, “Go back. Next time it’s drawn, I’ll make sure it meets your expectations.”

With that, the “Sword Immortal” vanished, and the long golden line stretching for over a thousand zhang finally disappeared.

Lu Cai Sang remained standing in place, unwilling to yield.

Chao Zhe already stepped aside, standing to the side.

Chen Ping'an looked at Lu Cai Sang, who wore a look of determination to face death. His face showed no sign of fatigue, but unexpectedly, he smiled, “Gu Can must truly regard you as a friend.”

After saying this, Chen Ping'an turned and walked back to the room.

Lu Cai Sang, who felt a bit of fear in his heart, turned to look at the cold sweat dripping from Chao Zhe and stubbornly asked, “Is this guy out of his mind?”

Chao Zhe didn’t dare say a word.

You, Lu Cai Sang, can run back to your master and hide, but I, if I provoke this discreet Sword Immortal, where can I escape to?

Chen Ping'an returned to the room and lit the lamp on the table.

One after another, local chronicles from various places in Book Scroll Lake were delivered, mixed with numerous genealogies from various islands. The reason Tianhu Jun could send them so quickly was simple—they were spoils captured from Qingxia Island, and they were the least valuable type. If Chen Ping'an hadn’t mentioned it, they would have eventually become a pile of waste paper to be burned. Now, Qingxia Island had eleven large islands as vassals, each of which had been thoroughly extinguished by that master and disciple.

Each needed to be reviewed and recorded meticulously.

After that, further inquiries would be necessary, and it wouldn’t just be a matter of sitting here writing.

However, Chen Ping'an didn’t think this was a difficult task. Firstly, he was good at enduring hard work; it was merely a matter of putting down some practice and doing another thing instead. Secondly, if he found this difficult at the beginning, he would have known to retreat long ago.

In the dead of night, the full moon hung high, casting a bright glow. Chen Ping'an set down his brush, rubbed his wrist, pushed open the door, and began to pace in circles to clear his mind.

He had already sent out three letters—to Pi Yun Mountain in Longquan County, Taiping Mountain in Tongye Continent, and to the Fan family in Old Dragon City.

He figured it would take some time to receive replies from the flying swords.

Chen Ping'an was not anxious; he couldn’t rush it.

He had traversed countless mountains and rivers step by step in the past; the swift exchanges of flying swords were much faster.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an stepped out of the circle, passed through the mountain gate of Qingxia Island, and headed towards the ferry.

Standing at the water's edge, he crouched down, scooped up a handful of water, washed his face, and, lifting his head, gazed into the distance.

For some reason, at that moment, as Chen Ping'an looked at the infamous Book Scroll Lake, which was practically a common sight in the Treasure Bottle Continent, he recalled a good saying whose origin he had long forgotten and didn’t wish to delve into now:

“Heroic spirit fills the world; for millennia, it still stands resolute.”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 453: Both Fists and Swords Can Be Laid Down

Chen Ping'an took a gentle breath, patted his cheeks, stood up, and returned to the small house at the mountain gate.

From a distance, the warm glow of the lamp shone through the window.

Instinctively, Chen Ping'an quickened his pace, only to suddenly slow down, chuckling to himself.

After turning four, there had never been a time when he “returned home” to find the ancestral house in Mud Bottle Alley lit up, waiting for him. After he became a young man, he broke his promise and became an apprentice at the dragon kiln, earning some copper coins. Yet, how could he leave the lights on every time he went out, letting the oil dwindle? Today, he had forgotten to extinguish the lamp when leaving. Rushing back now—what could he do? Blow it out? But he wasn’t the least bit sleepy now, destined to read late into the night. Would he light the lamp again? Then what was the significance of extinguishing and lighting it?

So, Chen Ping'an decided to walk slowly, entered the house, closed the door, and sat down behind the writing desk, continuing to sift through the incense hall archives and the genealogies of the ancestral halls across the islands, filling in the gaps.

With a restless heart, he chose not to practice his fist techniques; as for cultivating his spiritual energy (Qi), that was even less possible.

In the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, Chen Ping'an had learned that when his heart was in turmoil, practicing his fists was meaningless. That was why he often visited the small temple near the Top Scholar Alley, chatting idly with the old monk who seldom spoke of Buddhist teachings.

Moreover, at this moment, Chen Ping'an felt even less spirited than before; it was more complicated than mere restlessness. His energy seemed to have sunk to the depths of a well, bound by heavy stones. How could he lift it?

Yet this state of mind could also be considered a kind of tranquility in another sense.

Chen Ping'an closed the poorly preserved yellowed documents and picked up an ordinary small carving knife, a complimentary gift from the shopkeeper when he bought a jade hairpin in the capital of the Great Sui. He lightly traced a dashed line on the table with the handle of the knife.

After a moment of thought, he pulled out a piece of rice paper that he had cut to the size of a book cover, took up his brush, and drew a straight line. At both ends, he wrote “Gu Can's Mistake” and “Gu Can’s Virtue” in larger characters. Then, between “Mistake” and “Virtue,” he wrote the small characters “Local Customs of Shujian Lake,” but just as he was about to write down the laws of a nation, he wiped away the previous seven characters. Not only that, but he also erased “Gu Can’s Virtue.” In the center of the line, with a slight gap, he wrote “Recognize Mistakes” and “Correct Mistakes,” only to quickly wipe those away as well.

Finally, Chen Ping'an crumpled the paper into a ball but did not throw it into the bamboo basket; instead, he tucked it away into a corner.

With his hands folded in his sleeves, he leaned back in his chair, extinguished the lamp, closed his eyes, drifting between sleep and wakefulness. The next time he opened his eyes, it was already the dawn of a new day.

Often, one worries about life and death at midnight, fearing that a single day could turn into a hundred years.

Chen Ping'an stood up, stretching without needing to move his limbs; his joints naturally loosened with a series of cracking sounds. He stepped outside, planning to take a stroll around Qingxia Island. Qingxia Island was the largest among the islands of Shujian Lake, and walking around it would likely take half a day. Currently, a young female cultivator from Qingxia Island was responsible for his daily necessities, so he went to greet an older cultivator who was guarding the mountain gate nearby. Upon seeing the young female cultivator, he told her not to deliver the meal box today.

The old man, a cultivator of the Cave Dwelling realm, quickly agreed.

Chen Ping'an suddenly laughed, “She’ll probably still prepare it. If I’m not here, she won’t dare to enter the house on her own. So let’s do this: today’s three meals will be delivered to you. Let Elder Zhang enjoy a good meal. Elder Zhang mentioned quite a few old stories about Qingxia Island, so this will be a reward for him.”

The old cultivator hesitated, “Mr. Chen, I won’t endanger my life just because of a craving, will I?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “You won’t.”

The old cultivator remained uneasy; having seen too many unpredictable events on Qingxia Island made him timid. “Mr. Chen, please don’t fool me. I know you mean well, but seeing this old man’s meager life, you’re just trying to improve my meals. But those delicacies are exclusive to the Chun Ting residence. If you leave Qingxia Island in a couple of days, some envious scoundrels hiding in the shadows will surely make it difficult for me.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Then just keep the Chun Ting meal boxes here with Elder Zhang. I’ll come back to pick them up later.”

The old cultivator chuckled, “That’s much safer.”

After Chen Ping'an left, the old man muttered under his breath about the young man’s lack of social skills. If he truly wanted to help, couldn’t he at least give Chun Ting residence a heads-up? Who would dare to snub him then? This steward was just putting on an act, playing tricks every day in that small house. In Shujian Lake, he had seen plenty of such charlatans and name-droppers; they didn’t last long.

The old cultivator grumbled, like a flood breaking a dam, lamenting how this steward’s presence had cost him quite a bit, making him unable to bully some low-ranking cultivators into slipping him a couple of snowflake coins. When it came to some lovely young female cultivators, he could no longer dare to indulge in his usual antics, like whispering flirtatious comments and sneaking a pinch of their backside.

He had thought that by getting close to this steward, he might gain some familiarity that could potentially lead to fortune, perhaps even getting a good deal in Qingxia Island’s administration. Little did he know that this steward was a hard nut to crack, no amount of flattery would work. Either the young folk just didn’t understand the nuances of the conversation, or he was playing dumb, which was infuriating. He suspected that the steward only esteemed the likes of Lu Caisang, those favored by Gu Can, looking down on someone like him who had no prospects. How frustrating.

Chen Ping'an walked slowly, taking some detours up the mountain. He arrived at the residences of the worshipped cultivators on Qingxia Island, then returned the same way, finally making his way back to the main gate of Qingxia Island just as dusk fell.

From a distance, he saw the young female cultivator from Chun Ting residence, said to be Gu Can’s personal maid, standing gracefully at the door with a beautifully crafted meal box in her hands. The old cultivator was bowing before her, seemingly apologizing.

Chen Ping'an quickened his pace, took the meal box from the young female cultivator’s hands, thanked her, and noticed the girl with the fair and smooth skin of a Chun Ting residence maiden paying respects to him before quietly leaving.

Back in his house, Chen Ping'an opened the meal box and laid out the dishes on the table, along with two big bowls of rice. He picked up his chopsticks and savored each bite.

After finishing, he cleaned up the bowls and chopsticks, putting everything back into the meal box and closing it.

Life and death, right and wrong, are not matters to be taken lightly; if Gu Can could convince himself internally, he could wipe away those written words as if they never existed.

It was precisely Gu Can’s unwillingness to admit fault, to see it as a fault, that created a deadlock in Chen Ping'an's heart.

Since he couldn’t let go of Gu Can and wouldn’t deny the fundamental right and wrong in his own heart because of local customs, nor could he turn a blind eye to the truths that had sunk to the depths of Mud Bottle Alley, Chen Ping'an realized that to take the first step forward in correcting mistakes and making amends, he must first take a step back himself and acknowledge his own “inadequacies.” Leaving aside all reasoning, he needed to find a different path, walking while refining his thoughts, ultimately hoping Gu Can could come to recognize his mistakes.

In a hypothetical scenario, the heavens may be unattainable, representing eternity and immortality, but no mountain is insurmountable, symbolizing the myriad heartaches of the world.

Chen Ping'an wanted to confront these heartaches—his own, those of the deceased, and the concerns for the living who were once gone. These struggles were destined to wear down the eternal blade in his heart.

Making mistakes leads to two possible outcomes: either one persists in their mistakes or gradually corrects them. The former might bring temporary ease or even comfort throughout one’s life, ending with the resigned sentiment of “what’s done is done,” and people in the rivers and lakes love to chant that phrase about how after eighteen years, one will emerge as a true hero. The latter, however, can be particularly laborious and demanding, and the effort may not necessarily yield good results.

If ten people plant willows, and one is uprooted, then none will survive.

Chen Ping'an wanted to first test the truth of this saying from both sides. As for right and wrong, regardless of the final outcome, he would set those teachings aside.

During this time, all Chen Ping'an could do was urge Gu Can to restrain himself and not continue his reckless killing spree.

He had said so much to Gu Can that it felt like he had imparted a lifetime of wisdom. Fortunately, although Gu Can was unwilling to admit his mistakes, in Chen Ping'an's eyes, he was not an ordinary person, so he was willing to slightly temper his domineering attitude, refraining from fully embracing the mindset of “I simply enjoy killing.” After all, Gu Can wished to invite Chen Ping'an to their new home at Chun Ting residence from time to time, and to share a meal with them and the little mudfish, he needed to offer something in return. This sort of pragmatic transaction was quite sensible, even unobstructed in Shujian Lake.

Thus, Chen Ping'an asked Tian Hu Jun for a jade token of the Qingxia Island worshippers to hang at his waist. The next day, he began wandering around Qingxia Island, chatting with people.

On the day when the heroes gathered at Gong Liu Island to elect the "Rivers and Lakes King," Chen Ping'an even borrowed a ferry boat from Qingxia Island, donned his golden ceremonial robe, strapped on his sword, and set out alone. Using the identity of a Qingxia Island worshipper, he also proclaimed himself a novelist fond of writing travelogues about mountains and rivers. He ventured through the outer regions of Shujian Lake, exploring the many islands with this never-before-seen comical identity.

Following the map of the rivers and lakes that Tian Hu Jun had given him, he started landing on the more than ten vassal islands of Qingxia Island, including Mei Xian Island, where Tian Hu Jun had established his residence after achieving the Golden Core stage, and Su Lin Island, which was said to resemble white fish scales when the full moon shone down.

After tirelessly exploring these islands day and night, three days later, he jotted down several names that were not found in the incense hall archives.

On Gong Liu Island in Shujian Lake, arguments continued to erupt, revealing three factions: many island forces supporting Liu Zhimiao from Qingxia Island to become the new leader of the rivers and lakes, a faction staunchly insisting that Jie Jiang Zhenjun “is not worthy of his position,” and lastly, the fence-sitting island lords, either opportunistic or secretly allied, choosing to remain neutral for the time being.

Interestingly, each time those opposing Liu Zhimiao spoke, they seemed to have coordinated their remarks, often saying, “Though Jie Jiang Zhenjun is highly respected,” followed by various criticisms.

In Shujian Lake, the phrase “highly respected” was somehow more cutting than any insult, striking right at the heart.

On this day, Chen Ping'an steered the ferry to an island named Zhu Chai Island, located far from Qingxia Island. The island was small with few disciples of any sect, so island leaders who were undecided about attending the assembly at Gong Liu Island opted to remain behind, not wanting to get involved in this grand event which could determine the future landscape for the next hundred years.

Chen Ping'an docked his boat and stepped ashore, where he found a robust woman in exposed attire with her hair in an elaborate bun waiting at the landing. 

Chen Ping'an had already guessed the identity of this female cultivator, rumored to be Liu Chongrun, a former royal relative from a fallen dynasty in the central part of Baoping Continent. The last young emperor was said to have been brought to the throne by this woman, referred to as “aunt.” According to the anecdotes from Chi Shui City, the young emperor, still naïve at the time, had playfully patted the massive throne's seat, inviting his aunt to sit alongside him. To everyone’s shock, she had indeed taken a seat, cradling the young emperor in her arms, leaving the court officials in stunned silence, too intimidated to question her.

Tian Hu Jun once casually mentioned this Zhu Chai Island master, praising her for "having the spirit of a true man."

Liu Chongrun smiled, “You’re the steward residing at the mountain gate of Qingxia Island, aren’t you?”

Chen Ping'an was taken aback; no one on Qingxia Island had addressed him directly as a steward before.

He replied, “That’s one way to put it.”

Liu Chongrun cut to the chase, “You’re not here to cause trouble for Zhu Chai Island while all the nearby island leaders are at Gong Liu Island, are you?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “I’m just here alone to visit Zhu Chai Island, and I mean no disturbance. I wanted to ask Lady Liu about the customs of Shujian Lake. If you don’t wish for me to come ashore, I’ll take my leave.”

Liu Chongrun narrowed her sharp phoenix eyes, “What if I say Zhu Chai Island does not welcome the steward? On my island, there are only women, and most of them are not highly skilled. If anyone takes a fancy to you and drags you back to Qingxia Island as a concubine, should I release them or not?”

Chen Ping'an maintained his composure, cupped his fists to bid farewell, and turned to walk back to the boat, genuinely intending to leave for another place.

Liu Chongrun stood rooted, somewhat perplexed.

In fact, she had already prepared a beautiful young female disciple, considering it a way to avert disaster.

At the next neighboring island, Feicuizhou, he encountered the same cold reception; the island master wasn’t present, and the caretaker dared not allow a Qingxia Island "worshipper" to disembark. If they let him ashore and he took their entire crew of unruly Qingxia cultivators, who would they complain to? If he was alone, he wouldn’t dare refuse, but with a whole family tree to consider, they truly couldn’t afford to be careless. However, refusing to give a young Qingxia Island worshipper any face, the old cultivator did not dare let that person down either, escorting Chen Ping'an all the way out, apologizing profusely, as if he wished to kneel and bow to him. Chen Ping'an said nothing to comfort him but left swiftly, pushing the boat away.

On the third island, Huaping Island, the island master, a Golden Core Earth Immortal, was also absent. He had gone to Gong Liu Island to discuss important matters and was one of Jie Jiang Zhenjun’s most enthusiastic allies. A young island master was left behind to guard the lair. Upon hearing that Gu Can’s guest, the youngest worshipper from Qingxia Island, was visiting, he hurriedly jumped out of his fragrant haven, hastily dressed, and rushed to the landing, personally welcoming him with a smile.

Upon seeing the young worshipper from Qingxia Island, the young island master felt somewhat disappointed. He didn’t appear to be a skilled killer but rather like a village schoolteacher. Nowadays, the nearby islands were secretly discussing this matter, but Qingxia Island kept tight-lipped, revealing no useful information. They only heard that he was the one who had publicly slapped Gu Can, and Gu Can hadn’t retaliated, instead treating him with courtesy. Now the young island master and his friends were betting on how long this person could survive, with the young island master betting that he would die within a month. Who didn’t know that the notorious Gu Can was as capricious as the wind, killing at whim? The gasping cultivators served to Gu Can as food were not few.

Chen Ping'an had a drink at Huaping Island. He drank little, but the others indulged, discussing many “drunk truths” from the young island masters.

Back on the ferry, Chen Ping'an reflected on the nuances of their words and realized that Shujian Lake was no easy place to navigate. He left Huaping Island, anchored in the middle of the lake, and took out his pen and paper to jot down some names and events.

Thus, each day unfolded like this—stopping and going, witnessing different sights and happenings across various islands. Many, like Zhu Chai Island, also shut their doors and declined to let Chen Ping'an ascend their mountains.

On the map of Shujian Lake that he held close, more islands were being circled day by day.

Every morning before dawn, he would leave Qingxia Island in his boat and return after nightfall to the small house.

Shujian Lake was not only a convergence of wild cultivators from all over Baoping Continent; it also thrived on sorcery and witchcraft, with all kinds of unheard-of evil techniques emerging one after another.

Then there were islands like Huaping Island, where the cultivators loved extravagance, living in indulgence and revelry. On the roads, golden lotuses were carved, and flowers adorned the ground.

Another island, Ye City, had an arena for beast fights. Anyone daring to throw a stone at a ferocious beast would be committing a grave offense and subjected to severe punishment. Each day, disciples who had erred or enemies captured from other islands were tossed into the famous arenas of Ye City, where fine wines and beautiful women awaited the visiting cultivators, who came to enjoy the gruesome spectacles of the beasts.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 454: A Line to Follow

And then there was the island master of Attire Island, who was said to have once been a great scholar from a southwestern nation of Treasure Bottle Continent. Now, however, he took pleasure in collecting the hats of scholars from all over, using them as chamber pots.

One day, Chen Ping’an departed from an island called Cloud and Rain Island, home to two sects that specialized in dual cultivation techniques.

Upon seeing Chen Ping’an, one of the women from one sect regarded him with the hungry gaze of a ravenous wolf or leopard, regardless of her age. Yet, the jade tablet hanging from the young man’s waist, a token of Revered Green Gorge Island, deterred them from acting too recklessly.

As Chen Ping’an descended the mountain and boarded his boat, he felt a slight tremor, and the lingering fragrance of powder around his robe dissipated into the air.

On his way to the next island, he finally encountered a group of three assassins lying in ambush beneath the lake.

With the initial assaults from the first and fifteenth of the month, one assassin's core was shattered, severely injuring him and sending him tumbling into the water.

Taking advantage of the moment, a martial practitioner thought victory was assured when he punched the seemingly weak young man, only to find himself hurled into the lake.

Using a bamboo pole, Chen Ping’an pulled the three men aboard his boat, asking them questions. One of the assassins, seizing the opportunity during Chen Ping’an’s moment of contemplation, made a desperate sneak attack, only to be casually dispatched with a single punch.

Afterward, Chen Ping’an delivered the two living men, along with the cold corpse, to the shore near the Yun Tower City by Shujian Lake. Once one man shouldered the body and the other stumbled ashore, Chen Ping’an turned the boat around and slowly made his way back.

Half an hour later, dozens of Qi practitioners surged out of Yun Tower City, led by a seventh-level sword cultivator.

They surrounded Chen Ping’an and his ferry.

Chen Ping’an asked the sword cultivator, "Do you know who I am? What is your name? Are you here to fight because of a friend's loyalty, or do you already have a grudge against Green Gorge Island?"

The sword cultivator boasted that he didn’t even know the two men and could only consider them friends of friends. But all practitioners from Green Gorge Island were to be exterminated in Shujian Lake.

Chen Ping’an hesitated for a moment, refraining from using the sword immortal behind him.

Instead, he pinched out a talisman with his fingers.

It was the True Body of Day and Night Wandering Spirit Talisman.

In an instant, the seventh-level sword cultivator and several valiant men from Yun Tower City were subdued, while Chen Ping’an's flying sword, the First of the Month, pierced through one of the surviving assassins.

Ignoring the fleeing practitioners from Yun Tower City, Chen Ping’an, feeling increasingly weary, did not head to Green Gorge Island to claim two heads as trophies. Instead, he docked once more and secured his ferry before entering Yun Tower City, looking for a familiar face he had just met near Cloud and Rain Island.

No one stopped him. After crossing the threshold, he found the assassin who had previously shouldered a dead body. Hovering beside him was the flying sword, the Fifteenth, which had silently followed him into the city.

Chen Ping’an turned and softly called, “Charcoal Snow.”

A girl appeared atop the wall.

Chen Ping’an said, “Do not follow me anymore. Protect Gu Can, and also tell Gu Can not to involve himself in these matters. He must not take his anger out on Yun Tower City.”

The little mudfish nodded vigorously, as if granted amnesty, and quickly darted away.

Chen Ping’an placed the two severed heads on a stone table in the courtyard, sitting beside them. He looked at the immobilized assassin and asked, “Do you have anything to say?”

Realizing he was bound to die and with all hope lost, the man suddenly gained courage, laughing maniacally, “I’ll be waiting for you in hell!”

Chen Ping’an asked, “What if I change my mind and kill everyone who knows you in Yun Tower City?”

The man fixed his gaze on Chen Ping’an, “I’m dying anyway. What does it matter?”

Chen Ping’an glanced at the few people standing at the courtyard entrance and, after withdrawing his gaze, stood up. “I’ll come back to see you in a few days.”

He lightly stepped on the wall and seemed to depart from Yun Tower City.

However, as he left, the flying sword Fifteenth swiftly shattered the assassin's remaining core acupoints.

In truth, Chen Ping’an secretly returned to that estate shortly afterward.

What he witnessed was a farce.

It turned out that the assassin was not someone from the estate but rather a celestial being with close ties to the previous master of the household. He was a remnant of a sect from Shujian Lake that had nearly been wiped out. Previously, he had not been lurking in the easily exposed Yun Tower City but rather in a border town over three hundred miles away in Shihou Kingdom. Chen Ping’an had merely placed him here to recuperate, while the other assassin, well-liked and with connections in Yun Tower City, gathered a sizable force to hunt down the young man from Green Gorge Island. Apart from the grudge against Green Gorge Island, they also sought to take advantage of the opportunity to eliminate the rising star Liu Zhimou from Gongliu Island. If successful, the forces against Green Gorge Island in Shujian Lake might even protect them, allowing them to rise anew. Thus, the two had plotted, thinking the plan would work—seeking fortune and fame in danger while eliminating a formidable opponent from Green Gorge Island, what could be better?

This once-revered “old” celestial, now just a spectator in the estate, was soon apprehended by two offerings of the household, both merely fourth-level practitioners, along with a fifth-level pure martial artist. They were hesitant to act, fearing the man lying in a pool of blood might still possess some trump card. After much deliberation, they finally dared to restrain him, each drenched in sweat. The current head of the household then erupted in fury, cursing the man’s ingratitude, nearly dragging the entire estate down with him. The head of the household, his face twisted in rage, declared that even if he had to dig three feet into the ground, he would find the beautiful daughter who had visited years ago, forcing her to be a living painting for the assassin to admire day and night.

The bound assassin finally began to struggle desperately, his body bruised and bloodied.

The head of the household relished the moment, his eyes reddening as he delivered the most scathing remarks. “Don’t think your little girl, born late in your life, is hard to find. Others may not know your background, but I do. Isn’t she hiding in those border towns of Shihou Kingdom? I’ve heard she’s a waste without any cultivation talent but is beautiful—such a charming young woman will be easy to find if we spend a good amount of silver. If worse comes to worst, we’ll spread the news that you’re dying in Yun Tower City. Surely, your daughter won’t hide if she knows you’re on the brink of death!”

Three days later.

In a border town of Shihou Kingdom, a middle-aged man waited for a group arriving from Yun Tower City.

The group, eager to reach their destination, complained about their arduous journey.

A fourth-level practitioner and a fifth-level martial artist led the way, completely unaware they were being watched, even having their actions noted down.

After searching fruitlessly in the border town, the group hurried to a nearby county town in Shihou Kingdom.

Eventually, they found a modest household, where only an elderly woman and a young girl depended on each other. They were not wealthy, just a solid family.

The group didn’t rush in to seize the girl; after all, this was the county town of Shihou Kingdom, not Shujian Lake or Yun Tower City. If the old woman turned out to be an inconspicuous fifth-level practitioner, they could find themselves in deep trouble.

They devised a plan, sending the most simple-looking family guard to inform the elderly woman, claiming her father was gravely injured by practitioners from Green Gorge Island and was on the verge of death. He was unable to speak but kept repeating the names of the county town and his daughter. They had finally found her here and didn’t want to miss the chance to see him one last time.

At first, the girl didn’t open the door. However, upon hearing the grim news from the guard, she tearfully opened the door, her frail figure resembling a delicate willow, which made the guard’s throat tighten.

After packing her belongings, she suddenly remembered her caretaker, the elderly woman, who had been with her through thick and thin. She insisted on saying goodbye, worried that the old woman might feel anxious and sad if she couldn’t find her, perhaps even passing away before the girl reached Yun Tower City. Would she then be left without any family?

The guard, calculating, thought, “What a useless old woman.” Yet looking at the innocent and beautiful girl, about seventeen or eighteen years old, he figured letting her inform the old woman wouldn’t hurt. If he were too forceful, it might arouse her suspicion.

Thus, he changed his mind and decided to wait with the heart-wrenchingly beautiful girl for the old woman to return.

As soon as the old woman entered with a basket of vegetables, the guard’s smile froze as he felt a knife pierce through his back. The girl swiftly covered his mouth and gently pushed him, throwing him to the ground.

The elderly woman remained indifferent to this scene.

The girl suppressed her sorrow and worry, explaining the situation in Yun Tower City. The old woman nodded and remarked that it was probably the household taking advantage of the situation or pledging allegiance to the enemies of Green Gorge Island.

The girl pleaded with the old woman to visit Yun Tower City, even if it meant death; she had to go, even if she couldn’t see her father one last time.

The old woman sighed, lamenting that their peaceful days had come to an end. She glanced around and, like a bird taking flight, headed to the residence of the practitioners she had been observing for some time. After a bloody battle, she returned to the courtyard, clutching her nearly fatal wound. She told the girl that she had dealt with the lurking threat and that she could no longer go to Yun Tower City. She advised the girl to be cautious and handed her a lethal pill, emphasizing that it was for emergencies.

Feeling the unpredictable winds of fate, the girl forced a smile, wiped her tears, packed her things, and left the county town, heading towards the uncertain fate of Yun Tower City.

After the girl hired a carriage and exited the county town’s gates, she had no idea that a middle-aged man with a sword on his back was incapacitating everyone remaining in Yun Tower City, before visiting the elderly woman’s courtyard, where the old woman was coughing blood while brewing medicine. When the old woman saw the man’s silent appearance, she had already resigned herself to death. Unexpectedly, the seemingly unremarkable man, who resembled a wandering swordsman, tossed her a pill and squatted in the corner, helping her brew the medicine while asking about the origins of the slain practitioner. The old woman assessed the fragrant green pill while selecting her answers, revealing that the practitioner was a malevolent figure from Shujian Lake who coveted her daughter’s beauty. He had been skilled and adept at hiding, and while her master had been away for quite some time, this malevolent figure had recently let his guard down. He was likely from Cloud and Rain Island or Gold Leaf Island, aiming to abduct her daughter as a tribute to a powerful practitioner in his sect. She had originally intended to wait for her master to return before resolving the issue, but never expected her master had met with disaster in Yun Tower City.

The old woman found it increasingly baffling.

It turned out that during the intervals of brewing medicine, the middle-aged man even took out paper and pen to document his observations.

After assisting with the medicine, he stood up, but before leaving, he pointed at the body that had not yet been hidden and asked, “Do you think this man deserves to die?”

The old woman hesitated but chose to be honest. “If he doesn’t die, my daughter will be in danger. Once she reaches Yun Tower City, it will be a living hell. Among those who would bring her misery, he might be one.”

The middle-aged man said nothing as he exited the courtyard.

A few days later, late at night, a slender figure leapt over the wall of the estate in Yun Tower City. Although she had only spent a few days there before, her memory was keen. With the strength of a mere third-level martial artist, she moved as if in an unguarded realm, which also related to the fact that the three offerings of the estate were currently en route back to Yun Tower City.

However, when she landed silently in a courtyard, the entire estate suddenly lit up, lanterns igniting one by one.

This intruding woman, having been hired with a hefty sum, faced a temporary offering, a sixth-level sword cultivator, who deliberately positioned his flying sword against her heart rather than her brow or neck. He then gently placed a drawn sword on her shoulder, fingers aligning to rip away the veil obscuring her face. The youthful sword cultivator, resembling a flower-like elder, was taken aback and smiled, “Not bad, not bad. For someone who isn’t a practitioner, you have such exquisite skin. Truly a natural beauty. I’ve heard you’re just a pure martial artist; I can only imagine how much more enticing you’ll be after a little training.”

The sword cultivator turned to the estate's master and grinned, “As agreed, you need not pay the remaining half of the celestial coins.”

The girl stated she only wished to see her father one last time, and afterward, she would leave her fate to them.

The sword cultivator sheathed his sword, nodded, but then moved with lightning speed, striking the girl’s neck with two fingers, making her spit out a pill. The pale-faced sword cultivator caught it in his hand, sniffed it, his face filled with ecstasy, and then casually tossed it to the ground, crushing it underfoot. “A beauty like you, seeking death? Do you know how much the celestial coins I spent on your life are worth? Two hundred thousand taels of silver!”

For reasons unknown, the girl, feeling numb and weak all over, even found it a luxury to bite her tongue to die. She could only be held down by the sword cultivator, who dragged her into a side room of the courtyard. Kicking the door open, she saw the bloodied man with wide-open eyes.

The girl cried out.

The sixth-level sword cultivator, filled with pride, remarked, “After this father-daughter reunion, it’s time for…”

At that moment, the sword cultivator’s body tensed up. His flying sword, having just left the critical acupoint, trembled with a sound, colliding with another flying sword’s tip.

The tip of the sword shattered instantly, and the sword cultivator’s flying sword was gripped by two fingers.

The sword cultivator stiffened and turned, clasping his fists in respect. “I am Du Shehu, a junior from Yun Tower City, paying my respects to the sword immortal from Green Gorge Island!”

Unbeknownst to him, a pale-faced young man with a sword on his back had appeared beside the sixth-level sword cultivator.

The young man released his grip and handed the sword cultivator two small silver coins.

Du Shehu, trembling, accepted the two coins without a word and left the estate at once.

With the tip of his flying sword shattered, no amount of silver coins could compensate for this loss, especially since the cost of repairing his flying sword could never compare to the value of his own life.

It was a pity that the beautiful girl fated to meet her end would not find peace.

That night, a carriage slowly departed Yun Tower City for the gates of Shihou Kingdom. By dawn, having distanced themselves from Yun Tower City, Chen Ping’an dismounted the carriage, preparing to return to the ferry outside Yun Tower City, hoping that the boat tied at the shore hadn’t been stolen. Otherwise, that would cause some trouble.

The girl lifted the carriage curtain, sitting in the driver’s seat while her father slept soundly in the back, safe for now, though it would be difficult to return to the fifth level of cultivation again. She gazed at the young man’s back, holding back tears, and spoke solemnly, “One day, I will seek revenge on you!”

Yet the young man paid her no mind, not even sparing her a glance, deepening her sorrow and indignation.

Suddenly, a chill ran down her spine.

Because the man stopped and turned.

Chen Ping’an said, “I may be in Shujian Lake for at least two or three years. If that’s too short for you to seek vengeance and you’re uncertain, you can find me in Longquan County of Great Li in the future.”

The girl was taken aback.

Chen Ping’an continued, “You can bring a friend to help collect the bodies, because by then, I’ll only be killing you.”

The girl stared blankly as the young man gradually distanced himself.

Inside the carriage, her father seemed to awaken, coughing, “Don’t think about seeking revenge.”

She wiped her tears dry and turned to ask, “Father, when he was here, I couldn’t ask you. How did we end up with a grudge against him?”

Inside the carriage, the man was left speechless.

As they circled around Yun Tower City to reach the ferry, not only was the boat still there, but it also had two unfamiliar practitioners from Yun Tower City guarding it, likely to prevent any reckless thieves from drawing the ire of the offering of Green Gorge Island onto the entire Yun Tower City.

Chen Ping’an thanked the two practitioners and pushed off, leaving the shore.

As he traveled farther away, Chen Ping’an’s thoughts drifted. Coming back to his senses, he lifted a hand and drew a circle in the air.

It was a long journey to Green Gorge Island.

For the time being, Chen Ping’an also had no intention of heading to the nearby islands of Shujian Lake. On the way, he encountered a large ship that had come to fetch him. Chen Ping’an soared onto the deck, where Gu Can and the little mudfish stood side by side. Gu Can scratched his head and said, “Chen Ping’an, how come you’ve lost weight again after not seeing you for a few days?”

Chen Ping’an asked, “How are things on Gongliu Island?”

Gu Can rolled his eyes and tucked his hands into his sleeves, “It’s utterly dull, slamming tables, glaring, arguing all day. But this isn’t surprising; historically, the recent promotions of Jianghu monarchs in Shujian Lake dragged on for over half a year at times. They nearly built straw huts or assembly halls on the island to sleep on the floor. The shortest instance only took a month or so, because after endless arguments, one person got so fed up that he slaughtered over twenty of the then island masters, and that day, a new Jianghu monarch was appointed—it was that person’s mistress, the only female cultivator to ever sit on the Jianghu monarch’s throne in Shujian Lake.”

Chen Ping’an nodded.

Gu Can curiously asked, “Did you encounter anything interesting while you were away from Shujian Lake?”

Chen Ping’an pondered for a moment and replied, “I saw a line.”

Gu Can exchanged glances with the little mudfish.

Not wanting to dig his own grave, Gu Can changed the subject, smiling, “Green Gorge Island has already received its first flying sword message from our hometown, Piyun Mountain. That flying sword has been entrusted to me to be honored as an ancestor in the sword chamber. No one will dare to open the secret message without permission.”

Chen Ping’an looked back at Gu Can, nodded, and forced a smile, reminding him, “On Gongliu Island, the more peaceful it seems, the more cautious you and the little mudfish should be. I suspect that Great Li and Zhu Ying Dynasty will secretly vie for power in Shujian Lake. If you encounter such a situation, as long as either side gets involved, it’s best if you step back and refrain from acting hastily. Whether Liu Zhimou of Green Gorge Island can become the Jianghu monarch is no longer something you and the little mudfish can determine by taking down one or two Golden Core Earth Immortals.”

Gu Can responded, “Got it! I’ll keep that in mind! I know who I can take on and which forces I can’t provoke. I’ll think it through before acting.”

The little mudfish rubbed its belly, feeling a bit hungry.

Chen Ping’an then withdrew his gaze, continuing to admire the lakeside scenery.

He didn’t know if he would ever have the chance to look back in this lifetime, to see the beautiful jade sparkling in the distance.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 455: The Young Lady in Green Enjoys Pastries (Part 1)

Upon arriving at Qingxia Island, Chen Ping'an went to the sword house to retrieve a reply letter from Wei Ban, which had been sent from Piyun Mountain. In a flash, the flying sword disappeared, returning to Longquan County in the Great Li Empire.

After parting ways with Gu Can, Chen Ping'an made his way alone to a small house at the mountain gate. He opened the confidential letter, which answered his questions. True to form, Wei Ban provided not just one answer but three, also addressing Chen Ping'an's inquiries about the gentleman, Zhong Kui, and the old dragon city resident, Fan Junmao. The letter was lengthy, exceeding ten thousand words, detailing the rules governing the separation of yin and yang, the conditions under which a person could become a ghost after death, and the complexities of reincarnation associated with the two forbidden places, Fengdu and Hell. It elaborated on the variances in the paths to the underworld caused by local customs, the distinctions among ghost messengers, and more, providing a thorough explanation.

At the end of the letter, Wei Ban included two secret techniques he had personally authored. One technique was a forbidden method from the royal treasury of the Divine Water Nation, utilizing the essence of water energy between heaven and earth to swiftly locate a spark of true spiritual light, allowing for the gathering of scattered souls and the remaking of their spirits. Once perfected, this method could command all water-related ghosts, making it a closely guarded secret of the Divine Water Nation, known only to the national master and honored immortal teachers.

The second technique was a sideline method that Wei Ban had stumbled upon in the Divine Water Nation’s military armory. This method was closely related to witchcraft but mixed elements from the ancient sword immortals of the Shu Kingdom, used to break through the barriers of yin and yang. It established a bridge and pathway between the living and the dead, enabling conversations with deceased ancestors. However, it required finding a living person with a naturally dense yin energy constitution to serve as the dwelling for the returning spirits. In the letter, Wei Ban referred to this person as “Xingting,” who must possess significant ancestral merit or be an exceptional talent suited for practicing ghostly arts, with the latter being preferable, as the former could harm ancestral virtue, while the latter could enhance one's cultivation and turn misfortune into fortune.

Chen Ping'an read through the letter from Piyun Mountain repeatedly.

Unbeknownst to this accountant, after the recent conflicts at Yunyu Island and Yunlou City, news of Qingxia Island's formidable young foreign practitioner had spread like wildfire. The tales of this young man, who possessed two powerful spirit puppets capable of easily subduing sword cultivators of the seventh realm, along with his two life-bound flying swords, were astonishing. What was most terrifying, however, was that he was also adept in close combat, having killed a sixth-realm martial artist with a single punch in a face-to-face encounter.

A talisman master, an earth immortal sword cultivator, a martial arts grandmaster? 

What exactly was this accountant, stationed at Qingxia Island, capable of?

In the blink of an eye, Liu Zhimou’s reputation soared on Gongliu Island, and many fence-sitters began leaning towards Qingxia Island.

At the Chunt庭 Mansion that day, at the dining table, a woman spoke to Gu Can, who had rarely returned home for dinner lately, “Can Can, don’t follow Chen Ping'an’s example.”

Gu Can, who was wolfing down his food, replied indistinctly, “I won’t learn from him, of course not.”

The woman smiled with relief, using a handkerchief to wipe the grease off her son’s mouth, and whispered, “Chen Ping'an is such a good person; your mother liked him back in the day. But in our Shujian Lake, good people don’t live long; calamities befall them for a thousand years. It’s not an unpleasant saying. Although I’ve never stepped outside the Chunt庭 Mansion to see the world, I chat with the maids and servants every day. I know better than Chen Ping'an about the differences between Shujian Lake and the Mud Bottle Lane. Here, we can’t afford to be soft-hearted.”

Gu Can nodded, saying, “Mother, don’t worry, I know what I’m doing. There’s only one Chen Ping'an in this world; I can’t imitate him, even if I tried.”

Finally, Gu Can looked up, “Besides, there’s only one Gu Can in this world!”

The woman suddenly asked, “Previously, I only knew that Chen Ping'an had achieved great success, but how exactly? He doesn’t say, and I don’t want to pry too much. Now I hear those loose-tongued young ladies in the mansion chatting privately, and it seems that Chen Ping'an occupies a large island in Shujian Lake, and it’s more than enough? I heard that on that night, even Lu Caisang almost killed Chen Ping'an with a sword?”

Gu Can thought for a moment, “I’m not too sure. All I know is that the semi-divine weapon called the Sword Immortal, according to Liu Zhimou, seems like Chen Ping'an still can’t fully control it. Otherwise, all the golden core earth immortals in Shujian Lake wouldn’t be a match for him. Below the earth immortals, it would definitely be a one-sword affair. However, compared to this not-yet-fully refined Sword Immortal, Liu Zhimou is evidently more wary of that talisman. He asked if I knew its origins, and I just said I didn’t. It’s likely one of Chen Ping'an’s trump cards. Actually, I arranged for the little mudfish to follow Chen Ping'an to avoid any accidents that could ruin his journey in Shujian Lake, so the little mudfish has personally witnessed the powers of those two heavenly generals. The little mudfish said it seems different from all the talismans used by the talisman sect. The talisman’s core contains not a mere flicker of spirit light, but resembles the golden body of a mountain water deity.”

The woman sighed, “So Chen Ping'an has really achieved so much.”

Gu Can’s eating manners were poor; his face was greasy as he tilted his head and laughed, “Isn’t that so? As long as Chen Ping'an wants to accomplish something, he can do it. It’s always been like this; what’s so strange about it?”

The woman looked at her innocent son, feeling somewhat helpless. Some things needed a mother to think about; it had nothing to do with her capability as a woman.

As Gu Can took the little mudfish to join the commotion on Gongliu Island, the woman went to the back hall of the Chunt庭 Mansion, gathering the dozens of young ladies in the household. With a commanding tone, she admonished them, forbidding anyone from gossiping in front of Chen Ping'an. Anyone caught would be punished severely, and she would order a thorough search of the mansion's secret archives. If any relatives were already practitioners on Qingxia Island, she would have Tianhu Jun personally sever their ties. If they were not in Shujian Lake but had become wealthy due to gifts from the Chunt庭 Mansion, she would confiscate their properties and hand them over to the city lord of Chishui City, the Fan family, for handling.

That evening, as dusk fell, Chen Ping'an knocked on the door of an ordinary mansion on Qingxia Island. It belonged to a second-tier practitioner whose real name had long been forgotten. His surname was Ma, a ghost practitioner by origin, rumored to have once been a royal servant from a fallen kingdom, a minor role in the emperor's entourage. Somehow, he had become a practitioner, gradually establishing himself as an esteemed member of Qingxia Island.

Ghost practitioners were already looked down upon among the mountain and wild cultivators, and this particular one was particularly unwelcomed. Thus, this mansion was located in a remote area of Qingxia Island, lacking in spiritual energy but abundant in yin energy, situated beside a strange well that periodically blew cold winds. The mansion was perpetually shrouded in gloom, with no neighbors in sight. This ghost practitioner had once been the lowest-ranking among the first-tier practitioners on Qingxia Island. However, as Qingxia Island absorbed numerous subordinate islands, some island masters and visiting practitioners chose to align themselves with the rising star, the True Monarch of the Jiang River. Over time, the positions of the original practitioners on Qingxia Island were pushed further back, although Liu Zhimou did not cut the salaries of the veteran practitioners but instead increased them by a fraction, which prevented any dissatisfaction among the ranks.

The doorkeeper was a thin, foul-smelling old woman, yet her hair was lush and black, her eyes white as snow. Upon seeing the accountant surnamed Chen, the old woman immediately forced a flattering smile. Tiny creatures like flies and maggots tumbled from the creases of her shriveled face. Embarrassed, she hurriedly twisted her embroidered shoe, producing a loud cracking sound that was more revolting than alarming.

The old woman realized her mistake, her face flushing with shame, unable to utter a word.

Chen Ping'an maintained his composure, recognizing that this seemingly aged woman was actually just in her early twenties.

Every woman in the world has a desire for beauty.

She shook a string of bells next to the door and said to Chen Ping'an, “My master will be here shortly. Please wait a moment, Mr. Chen.”

After a slight hesitation, she pointed to a dim room next to the mansion’s main door, saying, “I won’t be in your way here. Just call out if you need anything, and I’ll be right there.”

Chen Ping'an nodded and asked, “May I know how to address you, young lady? I may need to visit often, and it wouldn’t do to keep calling ‘hey, hey, hey.’”

The unpleasant-looking old woman hesitated, unable to meet Chen Ping'an's gaze directly. She turned her head and softly said, “You can call me Hong Su, after the soft sugar.”

A swirl of black smoke appeared, and a small man emerged, dressed in a robe from which black smoke still leaked. He frowned at the old woman and scolded, “You shameless creature, how dare you stand here chatting with Mr. Chen! Hurry back inside! Don’t dirty Mr. Chen’s eyes!”

She quickly retreated into the side room, standing by a small window, not daring to look but hoping to hear the conversation.

As Qingxia Island thrived, the master had fallen from a first-tier practitioner to the position of a second-tier fringe practitioner. With Qingxia Island continuously opening new mansions and incorporating eleven surrounding islands, it had been a long time since there were any guests visiting the mansion. Familiar practitioners had long gone elsewhere, reveling in the nightlife, and unfamiliar practitioners were unwilling to come here to waste their time. She watched the mansion day and night, forbidding any chatter among the servants, so even the slightest rustle of birds flying past the mansion could leave her reminiscing for a long time.

Once inside, Chen Ping'an explained his purpose to the ghost practitioner.

The Ma surname ghost practitioner pondered silently, feeling a twinge of displeasure. This accountant, who had recently gained fame in Shujian Lake, was being a bit excessive. How dare he visit in person to demand the remnants of souls he had previously “picked up” and imprisoned? The souls trapped in the soul summoning talismans and that well of winds were part of his path, and among them, there were more than ten spirits possessing fifth-realm capabilities that he had refined into ghost generals, each serving a critical role.

Even if the young man claimed he was willing to purchase them with celestial money, was this really just a matter of money? 

This Chen fellow either truly didn’t understand the ways of the world or had intended from the start to bully others with his power. Weren’t you the one who had the ability to slap Gu Can twice? Why not ask Gu Can how much celestial money it would take to buy the life of that woman from Chunt庭 Mansion? Let’s see if Gu Can would agree to that!

The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, yet the Ma surname ghost practitioner still didn’t dare to break relations openly. If this enigmatic accountant truly wanted to stab him to death with a sword, that would be that. Would the True Monarch of the Jiang River really be willing to seek justice for a second-rate practitioner who had already lost his life? 

However, the ghost practitioner was stubborn and replied, “It’s true that I’m a ghost practitioner who captures souls, but the real beneficiary isn’t me; it’s the ghost king, Yu Kai, on Moon Hook Island, who has declared himself the Ghost King of the Mountain Lake. As the top general under the former Moon Hook Island lord, he not only defected from Moon Hook Island first but also followed the True Monarch of the Jiang River and the duo of Gu Can and his little mudfish. After each battle, he would always be responsible for cleaning up the aftermath. Nowadays, most of the souls of the deceased from various subordinate islands, including Meixian Island and Su Lin Island, have been divided among him and another earth immortal practitioner from the Yin Yang sect stationed at Yuhu Island. I didn’t even have a chance to get a piece of the pie; I can only spend money to buy some thick-yin, strong-spirited ghosts from the first-tier practitioners of Qingxia Island.”

There’s no deal that can’t be discussed; ultimately, it depends on the money and sincerity involved.

The ghost practitioner finally said, “Since Mr. Chen is willing to offer fair prices based on the levels of the souls, it’s reasonable. However, this matter is crucial to my path as a ghost practitioner. It’s not merely about showing respect. Unless Mr. Chen can accomplish a task for me, I won’t agree. After that, I’ll select the spirits from the soul summoning talismans and the well of winds to begin our transaction.”

Upon learning of this task, Chen Ping'an nodded in agreement.

After leaving the mansion and passing by the door, he bid farewell to the doorkeeper, the old woman known as Hong Su.

Returning to the mountain gate of Qingxia Island, Chen Ping'an didn’t go back to the house but went to the ferry, taking a boat to Pearl Hairpin Island.

He once again met the island master, Liu Chongrun, a tall and voluptuous beauty.

It turned out that the Ma surname ghost practitioner and this woman hailed from the same country, but their statuses were worlds apart—one was the aunt of the last emperor, wielding great power, while the other was a servant in the royal palace. As for how they had known each other and what had transpired in the past, Chen Ping'an didn’t pry. The ghost practitioner had chosen to ally with Liu Zhimou and selected Qingxia Island as his base to be closer to Liu Chongrun, the island master.

Liu Chongrun, praised by Tianhu Jun as “possessing the spirit of a great man,” had originally intended to make amends for the previous incident when she had declined Chen Ping'an’s visit to the island out of caution. After the outcomes of the conflicts at Yunyu Island and Yunlou City became clear, Liu Chongrun regretted her decision. With his profound skills, this man could easily inflict substantial casualties on Pearl Hairpin Island. Hence, she quickly sent an invitation to Qingxia Island, proactively inviting Mr. Chen to visit the Baoyu Pavilion on Pearl Hairpin Island, hoping to mend any rifts with the accountant.

However, upon hearing that the Ma surname ghost practitioner wanted to meet her, she immediately turned hostile, leaving Chen Ping'an on the side. She turned and ascended the mountain, coldly stating, “If Mr. Chen wishes to tour Pearl Hairpin Island, I, Liu Chongrun, will certainly accompany you. But if you’re here to act as a go-between for that shameless rogue, then I must ask Mr. Chen to leave at once.”

Chen Ping'an had no choice but to take the boat away and seek out the ghost king of the Mountain Lake, Yu Kai, who was one of the few large ghost practitioners in Shujian Lake with golden core cultivation, far superior to the Ma surname ghost practitioner.

Now occupying the entire Moon Hook Island and holding a status comparable to Tianhu Jun, he was one of Liu Zhimou’s regional officials. In contrast to the Ma surname ghost practitioner, who was becoming increasingly obscure, Yu Kai’s notoriety was growing, and he was becoming well-known in Shujian Lake. Moon Hook Island was a formidable island, and the old golden core island master was notoriously tough to deal with. Yet, due to Yu Kai’s defection, he had disrupted Moon Hook Island’s formation, allowing Liu Zhimou and Gu Can’s little mudfish to invade, catching over a thousand practitioners on Moon Hook Island off guard, resulting in heavy casualties. The exceptionally talented Yu Kai had, overnight, become immensely wealthy, gathering numerous fifth-realm souls, refining them with unique techniques, and it was rumored he could very well become the next golden core in Shujian Lake. He had also taken the wives and daughters of the former island master, living a life of luxury for nearly a year. Liu Zhimou had even jokingly teased him at a celebration banquet on Qingxia Island, calling him the happiest man in Shujian Lake.

Gu Can had given him a thumbs-up at that banquet, further boosting Yu Kai’s reputation, who promptly returned the gesture with three large cups of wine.

It should be noted that the notoriously arrogant little demon, Gu Can, almost never showed a good face to any practitioner.

As the ferry approached the shore, Chen Ping'an summoned two puppets from the talismans, which contained a spark of divine light.

He then ascended the mountain.

His style of action was very much in line with Shujian Lake.

He was no longer the amicable accountant of Qingxia Island.

This frightened Yu Kai, who had initially planned to put on airs, and he personally went to welcome the esteemed guest.

Upon learning that this Mr. Chen seemed intent on making a significant impact on Moon Hook Island, he was relieved when Chen Ping'an merely sought to purchase some insignificant souls.

With that, Yu Kai took the opportunity to express his grievances, explaining how he bore a deep grudge against the old island master of Moon Hook Island and how he had endured humiliation to eventually win over a little maid who had been bullied.

Chen Ping'an quietly listened to the ghost king’s complaints until Yu Kai felt he had nothing left to say. That was when Chen Ping'an initiated the negotiations for the soul purchases. Yu Kai, whether due to his own standing or foresight, was far more accommodating than the Ma surname ghost practitioner. Many of the souls that had barely any remnants left were almost given away for free to the accountant. If Yu Kai hadn’t already moved beyond the days of scavenging lowly spirits from graves, he would have long since refined all of them, as both ghost generals and higher-ranking ghost kings needed these scattered souls to sustain themselves.

Chen Ping'an also inquired about the methods for nurturing souls.

Yu Kai remained wary of the two puppets behind the young man, fearing they would turn violent at any moment. Thus, when it came to these nonchalant inquiries, he shared everything he knew.

Outside of Yunlou City, dozens of seventh-realm sword cultivators had been decisively killed by those two powerful figures. With this information, he, like all the earth immortals in Shujian Lake, began to ponder countermeasures, anticipating that a group of island masters might join forces on Gongliu Island to break the deadlock.

Among the tens of thousands of wild cultivators in Shujian Lake, there has always existed a principle that practitioners revered: no truly invincible treasure exists. What’s present today may be gone tomorrow, and by the day after, there will undoubtedly be a means to counter it.

Chen Ping'an did not require Yu Kai to see him off. At the ferry, he put away the talisman that had dimmed significantly and departed.

The autumn scenery of Shujian Lake was enchanting, with over a thousand islands, each showcasing its unique autumn beauty.

Chen Ping'an didn’t rush to return to Qingxia Island.

He paused the ferry on the lake, took out the Sword-Nurturing Gourd, and sipped some wine to refresh himself.

After setting aside the gourd, Chen Ping'an surveyed the surrounding lake scenery.

The ancient sage once said, "The nature of a gentleman is not different; he merely makes good use of resources."

This was why Chen Ping'an had written those three letters, sending flying swords in three directions.

He consumed the divine light of the talisman without hesitation, decisively using the day-night divine body talisman and even forced that semi-divine weapon to unsheathe.

Chen Ping'an now understood that the principles of the world have their thresholds. Too high, and one is unwilling to enter; too low, and one doesn’t take it seriously. Principles that are neither high nor low are seldom true, as they ultimately follow the underlying connections within a person’s heart, their perception of the world, and their approach to life. For instance, Gu Can’s mother never believed in retribution for evil, while Chen Ping'an always believed. This fundamental difference in their natures led to greater divergences in their calculations of gain and loss—one focused on tangible matters while the other considered beyond the physical.

If one were to delve even deeper, it would touch upon an individual’s most fundamental perspective on the world, related to the concept of “oneness” espoused by the national master, Cui Xuan.

Chen Ping'an had already contemplated this step previously but chose to halt and turn back.

Overthinking was of no use.

All decisions that shape a person’s nature and behavior, regardless of their breadth, size, correctness, or depth, ultimately rest upon action. It’s a matter of comparing skills among practitioners.

Now, Chen Ping'an had no choice but to set aside his fists and swords, even temporarily pushing aside significant matters like the ten-year and sixty-year agreements. Naturally, this afforded him ample time to reflect quietly. Looking at Shujian Lake, he could think more deeply than when he stood on the railing of the Ziyang Mansion in Huangting Kingdom, gazing far and wide. For instance, Chen Ping'an could firmly believe that Shujian Lake would become a battlefield of contention; before the Iron Cavalry of the Great Li Empire moved south, it had been a lawless haven for wild cultivators. The Zhu Ying Dynasty deemed it a troublesome area to consume but too costly to simply let be. Now that the balance had been broken, a monumental upheaval was inevitable.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 456: The Young Lady in Green Enjoys Pastries (Part 2)

Chen Ping'an was also waiting.

Whether it was the Zhu Ying Dynasty, situated conveniently by Booklet Lake, or the cavalry of the Great Li Dynasty from the northernmost part of Treasure Vase Continent taking control of Booklet Lake, or the Guanhua Academy mediating to prevent any one party from becoming too dominant, a new subtle balance was bound to emerge.

There would be signs of a national law capable of overshadowing local customs.

On Gongliu Island, arguments flared up daily, voices raised and faces flushed.

Such scenes were rare at Booklet Lake; previously, disputes required little more than verbal sparring before divine artifacts were brought out to settle matters.

Since this was a summit of island masters, the established rules had to be observed. Gu Can, Lu Caisang, and Yuan Yuan, among other friends, did not make an appearance at the prosperous hall of that mountain. Despite the majority of island masters greeting them with smiles, likely even calling the three rascals “brothers,” they felt no shame in it. Gongliu Island had become overcrowded lately, filled mainly with the confidants and trusted aides of various island masters. Following the sudden death of the female cultivator who had been the monarch of Booklet Lake, the island, once under her care for over two centuries, fell into neglect. Only a few elderly wild cultivators, still sentimentally attached, occasionally sent people to tidy up Gongliu Island; otherwise, it would have crumbled into a ruin overgrown with weeds and inhabited by wild foxes and rabbits.

The old master of Gongliu Island was the only wild cultivator at the fifth realm on Treasure Vase Continent, Liu Laocheng.

He hailed from a small place called Honey Tail Ferry in the southeastern part of Treasure Vase Continent, achieving the Golden Core stage on a narrow bridge suspended between two mountains in a minor sect, gaining significant notoriety at Booklet Lake.

When Liu Laocheng ascended to the fifth realm, he was supposed to establish a sect according to the ceremonial guidelines of the Confucian Academy. However, he instead placed a close associate, a female cultivator from Booklet Lake, on the throne of the lake’s monarch and left for parts unknown, wandering the world without a trace. This decision left Booklet Lake, which had just glimpsed the possibility of unification, in a state of fragmented chaos, paving the way for the rapid rise of Liu Zhimo and Qingxia Island, allowing unruly outsiders like Gu Can to wreak havoc at Booklet Lake.

As winter set in, Chen Ping'an often traveled between the residence of the ghostly Ma family cultivator on Qingxia Island and the Baozhu Pavilion on Zhucai Island, as well as between Yu Huai and a prominent Yin-Yang master.

Just when even Chen Ping'an felt that Gongliu Island was on the verge of reaching a conclusion, a shocking incident unfolded at Furong Mountain by Booklet Lake.

The island master of Furong Mountain was of low cultivation, and Furong Mountain had long been a small island dependent on Tianmiao Island, one of the major islands opposing Liu Zhimo's claim to the title of lake monarch.

Furong Mountain, known for producing exceptional seals made from Furong Stone in the central region of Treasure Vase Continent, was located on the outskirts of Booklet Lake, near one of the four major cities, Lvtong City. One night, a great fire erupted, igniting a fierce battle comparable to a confrontation between two Nascent Soul cultivators. The cultivators of Furong Mountain clashed violently with over ten unknown cultivators who had infiltrated the island, their radiant treasures illuminating most of Booklet Lake. Among them, a giant lantern resembling a celestial palace hung in the night sky above Booklet Lake, astonishing all who beheld it, rivaling the moon in brilliance.

In the end, a gigantic fire dragon, hundreds of feet long, roared into existence, coiling atop Furong Mountain, shaking the ground and stirring the waters. Those great cultivators from Gongliu Island who had initially intended to investigate quickly abandoned the idea, their gazes toward the river-stopping True Monarch Liu Zhimo filled with both intrigue and fear.

The island master of Furong Mountain appeared utterly devastated.

The island master of Tianmiao Island was even more furious, loudly rebuking Liu Zhimo for breaking the summit's rules and unilaterally attacking Furong Mountain during this period.

Liu Zhimo retorted, arguing that he wasn’t foolish enough to provoke everyone's wrath at such a crucial moment, especially against an island that belonged to Qingxia Island.

Tianmiao Island's master cursed Liu Zhimo vehemently. Without hesitation, Liu Zhimo confronted the Tianmiao Island master, who, despite lacking Nascent Soul cultivation, possessed an exceedingly rare treasure.

That night, Gu Can and the little mudfish stood side by side, gazing at the awe-inspiring fire dragon above Furong Mountain.

Gu Can smiled and asked, “Is it a relative?”

The little mudfish wiped its mouth and replied, “If we eat it, we might immediately ascend to the fifth realm and not have to complain of hunger for at least a hundred years.”

Gu Can's eyes glimmered with anticipation as he asked, “What are the odds?”

The little mudfish fixated on the brilliant flames of Furong Mountain, drooling uncontrollably, and had to cover its mouth as it cheerily said, “If it’s just a fight without any cultivators interfering, here at Booklet Lake, it’s a six-to-four chance—I have a slightly better chance of winning.”

Gu Can pondered for a moment, “Things aren’t that simple. This time, let’s listen to Chen Ping'an and not rush. Anyone daring to act now definitely isn’t looking for death.”

The little mudfish eagerly suggested, “Then I’ll sneak into the lake bottom just to take a peek at Furong Mountain?”

Gu Can shook his head. “It’s best not to do that. Be careful of falling into a trap. Once the news reaches Qingxia Island, I’ll discuss a foolproof plan with Liu Zhimo.”

The little mudfish pouted. “That old fox Liu Zhimo may not want to see me break through again.”

Gu Can squinted, speaking softly, “What if Liu Laocheng from Gongliu Island shows up? Do you think my master would still be calm?”

The little mudfish tilted its head. “Has that Jade Purity realm wild cultivator secretly returned?”

Gu Can smirked. “As long as we confirm afterwards that there’s a real opportunity for you to feast, and that after this meal, you won’t feel hunger for a hundred years, then even if Liu Laocheng doesn’t come to Gongliu Island, I will ensure ‘Liu Laocheng’ appears in one of the cities at Booklet Lake. Tian Hu Jun, Lu Caisang, Yuan Yuan, Yu Huai, and others can all be useful. If we’re going to do this, let’s do it big!”

At the peak of Furong Mountain.

In the night, a young lady in green with a ponytail flicked her wrist, and the fire dragon transformed into a bracelet, coiling around her delicate wrist.

Dong Gu and Xu Xiaoqiao exchanged glances, sharing a bittersweet smile. They had fought so hard to break through the mountain’s great formation and climb the peak, resulting in the death of one of the two seventh realm martial masters, only for their senior sister to end it all with a single move.

The young lady turned her head, pulled out a handkerchief, and delicately bit into a piece of pastry.

There was nothing to be done; even Old Master Song had used that lantern as his life-bound item and still nearly let a Golden Core cultivator skilled in soul separation escape.

Chasing after their master was becoming increasingly frustrating for her.

Yet she couldn’t bring herself to admit that she was actually quite bored after this long journey south.

Before her stood a tall young man, his face smeared with blood and his clothes tattered, glaring at her with a fierce hatred.

Finishing her pastry, her mood lifted slightly. She met his gaze and asked, “Want to die?”

The tall young man spat blood and recalled the tragic fate of his master, swallowed by the fire dragon. His heart was filled with rage as he gazed at her with fierce determination, clenching his fists and sneering, “You chased us this far, you Great Li cultivators, what do you really want? Isn’t it just to force me back to Great Li to serve you? To boost the martial fortunes of your Song family?”

She regarded the tall young man and slowly replied, “You’re quite clever. You don’t truly want to die; you just know that the Great Li’s sticky-fingered fellows won’t kill you. You want to take the celestial scroll and a life-bound treasure from your master, so you’ve been following him. However, I can see you do have some genuine feelings for your master. You want revenge now and plan to learn the celestial arts from that scroll, refine that treasure, then return to Great Li, hmm, and rather than torturing me, you plan to turn me into a puppet with preserved intelligence… Just wait a moment.”

She turned away, taking another small bite of pastry. Eyeing the few remaining pieces of peach blossom cake on her handkerchief, her mood soured, and she looked back at the tall young man, “Think it over. I’ll take another look. After all, you’re going to die anyway.”

The tall young man finally showed a hint of panic, turning to the one he recognized as the highest-ranking among them, Song Fuzi, the head of the Civil Affairs Department of the Great Li, sneering, “She says she wants to kill me. Do you think that’s feasible?”

She blinked her eyes, “If I want to kill you, not even all of them combined could stop me.”

Song Fuzi found himself in a dilemma.

Before this southern expedition, the old man had gleaned some of the most secretive information, such as why the Great Li court held the sage Ruan Qiong in such high esteem. An eleventh realm cultivator was indeed a rarity on Treasure Vase Continent, but why was the Great Li not like any secular dynasty on Treasure Vase Continent? Even the national master was willing to be accommodating towards Ruan Qiong?

The answer lay in the gentle and beautiful young lady before him.

The national master had only said one thing to the head of the Civil Affairs Department: If Ruan Xiu dies, you will all die beyond the borders of Great Li, and no one will come to collect your bodies. If Ruan Xiu wants to kill you, it would be your own doing. The Great Li court would not support you; instead, they would hold your superiors accountable.

With a gentle flick of her wrist, the petite and adorable fire dragon transformed and “dropped” to the ground, ultimately becoming a golden-armored deity striding confidently toward the now-begging tall young man.

In an instant, golden magma enveloped the tall young man, binding him like a cage as he let out a loud wail.

The golden deity merely twisted off the young man's head, opened its mouth wide, and swallowed both the head and body whole.

Song Fuzi’s face turned sorrowful, yet he dared not intervene.

After the arduous chase spanning miles, it all amounted to nothing.

Ruan Xiu turned her gaze toward Gongliu Island, pondering for a moment. She opened her handkerchief, glanced at the few remaining pastries, then reluctantly closed it, thinking she should conserve her food, as there were no pastry shops like the one in Qilong Alley here.

The young lady, whose eyes had always been as tranquil as a deep ancient well, suddenly sparked with brilliant light. Tilting her head, she wore an expression of disbelief as her gaze shifted toward a location some distance from Gongliu Island.

It was as if she had spotted a familiar presence more delicious than the pastries.

She quickly retrieved her handkerchief, popping another piece of pastry into her mouth, shaking the handkerchief to get the last few crumbs, then tucked it into her sleeve. Finally, she clapped her hands and nodded contentedly.

Her cheeks bulged; it looked as if she were trying to hide stolen goods.  
(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 457: The Names in the Story (Part One)

Ruan Xiu carefully stowed away the "bracelet," which appeared to be a delicate and charming dragon made of fire, coiled around her wrist, emitting soft snores. The battle at Furong Mountain had resulted in the deaths of two Golden Core Earth Immortals and even consumed a fortunate young man, leaving it feeling a bit overstuffed.

Ruan Xiu posed a question that caught Old Song, the Confucian scholar, off guard. "Can I take some Furong Stones back to Longquan County? I want to open a shop selling seals and Feng Shui stones in the alley of the town."

This scholar from the Ministry of Rites, known for his quick thinking in the Da Li Dynasty, had once had a celebrated encounter with the emperor, answering thirty-seven questions in the span of a single incense stick. Now, he found it hard to keep up with Ruan Xiu's line of thought. After some contemplation, he chuckled, "As long as Ruan girl finds stones of sufficient size, you could empty out Furong Mountain without issue."

After receiving the answer, Ruan Xiu immediately instructed Dong Gu and Xu Xiaoqiao to start "excavating the mountain." As her two junior disciples played the role of hardworking farmers, Ruan Xiu turned to the elder and said, "Old Song, rest assured, I won’t let you make this trip for nothing. At Shujian Lake, in the Green Tung City we passed through, and on our way back to Da Li, if we follow the same route, I will help you find three suitable candidates for cultivation. Together, they’d be nearly as good as... what was that name again? Xu Xiaoqiao?"

From a distance, Xu Xiaoqiao softly replied, "Han Jing."

Ruan Xiu nodded. "Right, he's not any worse than Han Jing. One is a grandson of the old man selling fragrant pastries at the Land Deity Temple in Green Tung City, the closest to us. Another is that little girl from the candy figurine stall at the Ganlu Temple in the Shihau Kingdom, whom I once gifted a sugar figurine. You know, the adorable girl with two rosy cheeks. The last one is a local kid I met at the Xianjia ferry called Lianzhi, who was competing with me on who could eat more when I bought a large bag of osmanthus persimmon cakes. In the end, he ended up with a toothache and ran home crying for his parents."

The three Da Li disciples were somewhat incredulous—was she serious?

Unexpectedly, Old Song nodded. "Once Dong and Xu have excavated enough stones from Furong Mountain, we will first return to the Land Deity Temple in Green Tung City and find that child named Tong Shan."

The disciples understood immediately; if even Old Song had remembered that child's name, it was clear he was an exceptional prospect for cultivation.

Ruan Xiu looked up towards Gongliu Island, and as she did, the fire dragon on her wrist, which had been preparing to "hibernate," opened its eyes and lifted its head to gaze in that direction alongside her.

Some ancient dragon descendants had an inherent penchant for battling their own kind, and in the history of the Ancient Shu Kingdom, such fierce beings were often the first targets of sword immortals seeking experience.

Suddenly, Xu Xiaoqiao said, "Senior Sister, Master instructed us that aside from official business, you are not allowed to..."

As he spoke, he cast a glance at the black-robed youth, Dong Gu.

This trip to Furong Mountain had seen this second senior brother reveal his true strength, forcibly breaking through the barrier of the formation, resulting in severe injuries—he had lost a tusk and had depleted at least forty to fifty years of cultivation.

Dong Gu's expression turned serious, completing the words Xu Xiaoqiao hesitated to say: "Act recklessly."

Ruan Xiu scanned her surroundings with a hint of regret. "Then let's hold off for now."

Both Dong Gu and Xu Xiaoqiao nodded in agreement, with Old Song following suit.

Ruan Xiu found their synchronized movements amusing, laughing, "What are you doing, pecking like little chicks?"

Her laughter caused the young disciple, already infatuated with Ruan Xiu, to become entranced, lost in her charm.

————

In the bustling Yawning Monkey Street of Chishui City, known for selling celestial artifacts, an elderly man in a long blue robe wandered through. His appearance was unremarkable, resembling an ordinary wealthy patron from a prosperous family. He repeatedly rubbed a snowflake coin between his fingers, strolling and observing, yet he seemed to be more of a window shopper than a buyer. Fortunately, Yawning Monkey Street was filled with eccentricities, and no one paid much attention to the tall, thin old man.

As the man approached a shop, the recently successful shopkeeper was enjoying a drink, accompanied by two plates of snacks—salted peanuts and silver fish fillets, a specialty of Shujian Lake. Upon seeing the old man in the long robe, the shopkeeper didn’t even bat an eye.

The old man seemed somewhat disappointed and curiously asked, "Shopkeeper, has that large imitation Yellow Sword sold yet? Oh, and the lady painting too? Did you find a big spender?"

The old shopkeeper, known for his peculiar personality, was not a skilled salesman. If he were a typical shop owner, he would have rolled his eyes or chased away such a nonchalant customer long ago. However, he found the old man interesting and replied with a smile, "Indeed, it was the same customer—a traveler from afar, quite discerning. Hardly a big spender; you can't buy what you cherish for any amount of money."

The old man clicked his tongue. "Not bad, not bad. Your grand-uncle's business acumen leaves much to be desired, but your luck seems to be far better. I thought those would gather dust for at least a hundred years."

The shopkeeper cast a sidelong glance at the stranger. "You speak quite boldly. Which island master from Shujian Lake are you? Heh, if I recall correctly, those with any semblance of skill are all holed up on Gongliu Island these days, too busy to come here to play at being a wise sage."

The old man sighed. "With hundreds of people eating, drinking, and living on Gongliu Island, isn’t it just a latrine?"

The shopkeeper chuckled, "Those flying immortals aren’t like us mundane scholars. Gongliu Island won't turn into a toilet. Besides, once the alliance meeting is over, who cares what that chaotic graveyard turns into?"

The old man sighed again. "I care quite a bit."

The shopkeeper found this increasingly amusing and beckoned, "Old fellow, care for a drink?"

The old man shook his head. "It’s hardly better than swill; I’ll pass."

The shopkeeper laughed and scolded, "Kindness mistaken for folly! If you don't want to drink, fine, but your foul temper is to my liking. Look around the shop as you please; if you find anything you like, I'll give you a ten percent discount."

The old man waved his hand and exited the shop.

He wandered through the entirety of Yawning Monkey Street. It had been too long since he last returned to Shujian Lake, and everything had changed; he no longer recognized a single familiar face. Leaving Yawning Monkey Street, he arrived at a quiet alley in Chishui City. At the end, he took out a key and unlocked a gate, revealing a hidden paradise within.

No one lived there, but every so often, someone was responsible for its upkeep, and they did so with great diligence. Thus, the winding corridors and deeply secluded courtyards remained pristine and dust-free.

The old man reached a water pavilion, pushing open a window, and listened carefully to the sound of spring water cascading over stones, a refreshing melody.

About half an hour later, a plump, unremarkable man from Chishui City arrived outside the water pavilion, bowing respectfully. "Junior Wang Guanfeng, pays his respects to Old Ancestor Liu."

The old man turned around, smiling. "You're that great-grandson of the Wang family from the Shihau Kingdom's Water Department, aren’t you? Come in and sit. Your family once did me a favor; knowing my character, the Wang family from Chishui City, who moved from Shihau, has always been more perceptive than many of the youngsters now in Shujian Lake. There's no need for such formality."

Inside the water pavilion, there wasn’t much decoration—just a few white mats laid out on the floor. Wang Guanfeng, richer than the city lord of Chishui, Fan, sat nervously on one of the mats, not daring to take the old man’s kindness lightly.

The elder Liu inquired about recent events in Shujian Lake, and Wang Guanfeng answered one by one.

After Liu heard about the current situation on Gongliu Island, he laughed. "Even I, from such a distance at Fengwei Ferry, have heard of the notorious reputation of Liu Zhimao and Gu Can from Qingxia Island."

Wang Guanfeng weighed his words carefully before responding. "Currently, the Song family of Da Li and the Zhu Ying Dynasty are engaged in a struggle over Shujian Lake. We placed our bet on Qingxia Island, while the Zhu Ying Dynasty seems to have allied with Qingzhong, Tianmou, and Lici Islands, with a royal swordsman overseeing it. However, the whereabouts of that person remain unknown. Within the Zhu Ying Dynasty, there are likely differing opinions on whether to recruit or eliminate Gu Can, and they haven’t reached a consensus. Therefore, the earlier assassination attempt in Chishui City, one faction of the Zhu Ying Dynasty has already suffered a heavy blow. Liu Zhimao himself remains in the Nascent Soul stage, with no signs of breaking through, while Gu Can’s companion, that dragon-like creature, has already entered the Nascent Soul stage, demonstrating astonishing combat power that even Liu Zhimao must fear. It’s possible that in the future, they will split Shujian Lake. But all of this is just a result of the old ancestor watching from the sidelines."

The old man chuckled and asked, "That little demon named Gu Can, who claims to be invincible in Shujian Lake?"

Wang Guanfeng cautiously inquired, "Is the old ancestor suggesting we switch our bet to the Zhu Ying Dynasty?"

The elder shook his head. "That’s a different matter. Liu Zhimao’s current success is half due to Gu Can and that Nascent Soul dragon. Let him enjoy the position of Shujian Lake’s ruler for a few days. When Gu Can is dead, Liu Zhimao will be half-crippled. When the walls come tumbling down, everyone will push against it. Whatever the surname of Shujian Lake was two hundred years ago, it will still be the same in two hundred years."

The old man chuckled. "When did the wild cultivators of Shujian Lake become so fearless? A mere child dares to flaunt his power like this?"

Wang Guanfeng explained, "The Zhu Ying Dynasty likely has designs to recruit Gu Can and curb Liu Zhimao, or else they wouldn’t allow Gu Can to act so brazenly. However, the speed at which that dragon has grown is astonishing—it went from Earth Immortal to Nascent Soul in less than three years, which truly blindsided all of us."

The old man was clearly not the type to criticize his subordinates harshly. He nodded in agreement. "It's not your fault. I discussed this with two friends during my travels, and they, with their higher realms and insights, share your sentiments—it's indeed astonishing."

"It's perfectly fine to bet on Liu Zhimao; if you’re not afraid of me swindling your Wang family's money, feel free to wager your entire fortune."

The old man concluded with a smile, "As for Gu Can, I will personally take care of him when the time comes. You all just need to play dumb, observe the changes, and wait to collect your money."

Wang Guanfeng swallowed hard.

The old man’s expression was indifferent. "Since everyone here is a wild cultivator, no one’s life is more valuable than another's. No one can kill all the way to the end. At least here in Shujian Lake, in my presence, that’s not how it works."

Wang Guanfeng bowed deeply.

Shujian Lake indeed has its rules—whenever the old men speak, the young people remain oblivious.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 458: Names in the Story (Part 2)

The old gatekeeper of the Ghost Cultivator’s residence had recently become a bit more spirited, eagerly awaiting the daily visits of the young accountant, Mr. Chen.

Even though Mr. Chen was always in a rush, barely pausing to chat with her and only exchanging brief greetings, the old woman, known as Hong Su, felt a flicker of joy. Despite her ghostly appearance, she cherished these fleeting encounters.

After Mr. Chen departed that day, she stood at the entrance, gazing after his retreating figure. It wasn’t until her master appeared beside her that she realized he was there. The ghost cultivator, surnamed Ma, snorted coldly, “What, still hoping for a sparrow to fly onto a branch? You’re thinking of raising someone like Chen Ping’an to be your maid?”

Quickly, she bowed deeply, feigning humility. “My lord is joking. How could a mere servant like me dare to entertain such foolish thoughts?”

The ghost cultivator tossed her a small pouch filled with celestial coins. “That Chen Ping’an will be visiting often. A snowflake coin each day should be enough to restore you to your former self for about ten days. We wouldn’t want him to think that the Zhu Xian residence is a hell where even a living gatekeeper can’t be afforded.”

She cradled the pouch of celestial coins in her hands, bowing in gratitude.

Of course, she harbored no real feelings for the young and gentle accountant. Women in the world, regardless of their beauty or lack thereof, do not automatically fall for men based solely on their goodness. Likewise, one cannot dislike someone just because they are not as appealing. The deity of marriage, who weaves the red threads connecting men and women, must surely be an old rascal at heart.

With her hair as dark as silk yet her face lined with age, Hong Su found her monotonous existence at the gate of the residence tedious. Day in and day out, year after year, it was far too dull. So, when she finally encountered a young man, she naturally wanted to treasure the moment.

Uncharacteristically, the ghost cultivator stayed behind at the door today, gazing out over the vast lake beyond Qingxia Island, a troubled expression on his face.

Previously, Liu Zhimiao had clashed violently with the old island master of Tianmou Island, nearly turning the latter’s brains into the rice porridge served at the late-night feast on Gongliu Island. Although morale among the allies of Qingxia Island appeared to be soaring, discerning eyes recognized the gravity of the tragedy at Furong Mountain. Whether or not Liu Zhimiao had orchestrated the event from behind the scenes, his path to the throne of the Jianghu overlord had been severely obstructed, losing the support of many minor island masters in the process.

There were two enduring golden rules in the Shujian Lake: one was to help friends, not principles; the other was to assist the weak, not the strong.

Thus, the atmosphere on Qingxia Island had grown tense in recent days, and the banquets of the twelve major islands had dwindled significantly.

Chen Ping’an continued to visit the Zhu Xian residence, Yuegou Island, and Yuhu Island frequently. Yu Huai of Yuegou Island was the most agreeable, making their business dealings smooth. The prominent Yin-Yang master on Yuhu Island was acceptable as well; while they didn’t share a warm camaraderie, his straightforward merchant demeanor was something Chen Ping’an could appreciate. However, the Ma-surnamed ghost cultivator here remained obstinate. Unless Chen Ping’an could persuade Liu Chongrun of Zhu Chai Island, there would be no discussions. So, Chen Ping’an acted like a matchmaker, visiting Zhu Chai Island from time to time. Liu Chongrun was even tougher than the ghost cultivator; unless Chen Ping’an refrained from mentioning that baggage, he wouldn’t be welcome at Zhu Chai Island. The luxurious Baozhu Pavilion there offered fine wines, teas, and lovely ladies, all waiting. But if he were to act as an intermediary for a lowly servant of the ancient Liu clan, he wouldn’t even be allowed past the gate.

Stubbornly, Chen Ping’an decided not to cross the mountain gate. Each time he met Liu Chongrun at the ferry, he would merely exchange a few words before returning.

In truth, the two could have had a proper conversation. They had wandered in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land for nearly three hundred years, witnessing numerous court and royal affairs. However, Chen Ping’an was unwilling to divert his attention now, nor could he afford to. Whenever the day came for him to leave Shujian Lake, he would definitely pay a visit to Zhu Chai Island to ask Liu Chongrun about some of the doubts lingering in his mind regarding the woman who almost became the first female emperor of Baoping Continent.

Though he couldn’t smoothly negotiate for those lost souls with the Ma-surnamed ghost cultivator, exchanging insights on ghostly techniques turned out to be more meaningful than chitchatting for two hours with Yu Huai. As for the Yin-Yang master of Yuhu Island, he was so serious that even if Chen Ping’an wanted to converse, he couldn’t pry open his mouth. Thus, Chen Ping’an found himself at Zhu Xian residence more often, strolling around Qingxia Island. Many times, he would realize he hadn’t figured something out, only to find himself at his destination upon looking up.

That day, as dusk fell, Chen Ping’an had just returned from the sword room, where he collected a secret letter via flying swords, and came to Zhu Xian residence for some leisure.

He had received a reply from Fan Junmao of Longcheng, but it consisted of only four words: “No comment.”

Chen Ping’an was at a loss.

The future Southern God of Dali, standing at the same level as Wei Ban, was not someone to provoke lightly, especially since Fan Junmao was considerably less petty than Wei Ban.

However, Chen Ping’an had clearly stated in his previous letter that he was seeking help, and both parties were engaging in a transaction. Fan Junmao shouldn't have responded this way.

After greeting the gatekeeper, the old woman, Chen Ping’an set off to find the Ma-surnamed ghost cultivator.

There was no pause, no lengthy conversation. Even as Hong Su’s appearance returned to that of a middle-aged woman, she felt no sense of loss; in fact, she found this state quite satisfactory—mysteriously, it even felt more comforting.

That day, after Chen Ping’an left Zhu Xian residence, he found Gu Can and Little Mudfish standing at the end of a path. Gu Can asked if Chen Ping’an was free that night, mentioning that his mother had made some home-cooked dishes.

Chen Ping’an replied that he couldn’t tonight, as he had to visit two islands farther from Qingxia Island, and by the time he returned, it would be very late—too late even for a midnight snack.

Gu Can looked a bit disappointed.

Chen Ping’an said nothing further.

Gu Can escorted Chen Ping’an to the door of the house, then suddenly asked, “Chen Ping’an, you have some opinions about my mother, right?”

Chen Ping’an ruffled his hair. “Don’t overthink it. If there’s something important, I’ll find the time and opportunity to talk with your aunt. But as for you, I promise I won’t say anything bad about your mother.”

Gu Can seemed to understand, leading Little Mudfish away.

Chen Ping’an returned to the house, focusing on his desk.

Inside the high-rise of Chishui City.

Cui Zhan set down a secret letter.

He rubbed his brow, pondering deeply.

Cui Dongshan remained in that golden thunder pool, not having moved an inch, but now he was imitating Chen Ping’an’s Earth-and-Sky Stance.

The ways of the world and fluctuations of human hearts leave traces to follow, which had always been a deep area of research for Cui Zhan.

He murmured to himself, “On one hand, Chen Ping’an arrived earlier than expected, thanks to Gu Tao’s intellect, and of course, Chen Ping’an’s as well, which is certainly better than that of the Water God of Xiuhua River. This prevented Ruan Xiu and Gu Can from inflicting mutual damage in Shujian Lake. However, this was inherently part of Chen Ping’an’s strategy; even if you weren’t here, I wouldn’t stop him.”

“On the other hand, I slightly underestimated Gu Can’s determination. I didn’t act rashly that night, directly employing the Mudfish to provoke Ruan Xiu. As for Ruan Xiu’s fondness for Chen Ping’an and the shifting focus from the Mudfish, combined with Liu Lao Cheng’s ambitions as the lord of Gongliu Island, both are greater variables than I initially thought.”

“Based on the outcomes from that Dragon Riding Alley incident back then, I can roughly conclude that Ruan Xiu is someone of great importance to the old Divine Lord, even more so than Li Liu or Fan Junmao. She is likely the one from the original Divine Path spirits, capable of seeing the karmic retributions on a person. With her around, Chen Ping’an effectively knows the exam questions in advance—the Fourth Difficulty, which is difficult among the countless difficulties, can be nearly halved. But I still let that Ruan Xiu, who found numerous excuses and lingered in Lvtong City, remain in Shujian Lake without a hitch, allowing you to lose convincingly.”

At this point, Cui Zhan smiled as he glanced at Cui Dongshan.

Since Liu Lao Cheng secretly entered the territory of Shujian Lake, he still hadn’t communicated with the Dali intelligence network through any channels.

This indicated that Liu Lao Cheng, a wild cultivator of the fifth realm, had climbed into a relationship with the old master of Yuguizong, Xun Yuan, and had decided to take a leap of faith, gambling all his assets in Shujian Lake to establish the Yuguizong's sub-sect mountain gate there. Generally speaking, sitting back and watching Liu Zhimiao unify Shujian Lake, Liu Lao Cheng, as the lord of Gongliu Island, had many old ties hidden beneath the surface. As long as Yuguizong’s sub-sect chose Shujian Lake, Liu Lao Cheng wouldn’t lose; in fact, he’d profit slightly. The only downside was that the majority would fall into Liu Zhimiao’s and the behind-the-scenes Dali Song family’s hands. However, as a wild cultivator from the mountains, where the stakes were fifty-fifty, who wouldn’t gamble? Moreover, Liu Lao Cheng was the foremost wild cultivator from Baoping Continent. Despite Liu Zhimiao’s growing wings, he wouldn’t necessarily want to burn everything down when faced with Liu Lao Cheng, who had deep roots in Shujian Lake.

That was the trend of the times.

Liu Lao Cheng possessed it.

A single person could monopolize a portion of the grand trend.

How exceedingly difficult that was.

Liu Zhimiao was still far from it. Half of his achievements relied on his disciple Gu Can and a beast, like a woman carefully saving every penny. Could he possibly compare to Liu Lao Cheng, who could carve a bloody path on his own? In terms of cultivation, temperament, and cunning, they were not on the same level. Even if Liu Zhimiao had an additional one or two hundred years to cultivate his domain and accumulate connections, he would still need to step into the fifth realm to stand a chance.

In contrast, Liu Lao Cheng was, after all, a hero whom Cui Zhan admired.

Cui Dongshan walked on his hands, casually saying, “With Ruan Xiu remaining in Shujian Lake, you can still act accordingly. The self-emergence of one or two key pieces leads to variables that don’t hinder the overall situation. You can still steer it toward your desired trend.”

Cui Dongshan flipped over and stood upright, a nonchalant expression on his face. “Find an excuse for the Songs and have them leave Lvtong City quickly.”

Cui Zhan laughed, asking, “Why? Clearly, you’re making a small profit. Don’t you want that?”

Cui Dongshan rubbed his cheeks vigorously. “Of course, I want to gamble! If I lose, it’s fine to lose everything. If I win, I’ll leave Shanjiao Academy and plan for the grand situation south of Baoping Continent for you.”

At this point, Cui Zhan was genuinely puzzled and had to ask, “Why is that?”

Cui Dongshan played the rogue. “I just like it! I enjoy watching you calculate and then find out you’ve calculated nothing of importance.”

Cui Zhan laughed heartily. “You’ll be disappointed then.”

Cui Dongshan threw a flurry of playful punches, then asked, “Why?”

Cui Zhan smiled brightly. “You can take a guess.”

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan asked, “If Liu Lao Cheng were to kill Gu Can, wouldn’t that be a case of a tiger’s head and a snake’s tail?”

Cui Zhan countered, “The one who truly needs to be anxious isn’t me, is it? It’s you.”

Cui Dongshan chuckled.

Cui Zhan smiled slightly. “Now I must say something quite unromantic. If Chen Ping’an begins to face the countless vengeful spirits calmly, all sorts of interesting events are bound to happen. Among them, even if there’s just one ghostly entity or a living relative of a ghostly entity who confronts Chen Ping’an directly, asking, ‘Apology? Not needed. Compensation? Also not required. I just want to trade a life for a life; can you do that?’—at that moment, how will Chen Ping’an handle it? What will his heart harbor? And this is just one of the countless difficulties.”

Cui Dongshan jumped around, covering his ears. “I’m not listening! I’m not listening! The old turtle’s preaching is unbearable!”

——

At the Zhu Xian residence.

On this day, Chen Ping’an sat on the doorstep, and the woman named Hong Su, for some reason, no longer relied on the daily infusion of a snowflake coin’s spiritual energy to maintain her appearance. Consequently, she quickly reverted to the elderly visage he first encountered.

Then, on this day, Chen Ping’an suddenly pulled out paper and pen, smiling as he said he wanted to ask her about some old stories. He wasn’t sure if it was appropriate and assured her he had no other intentions, so she shouldn’t misunderstand.

Before answering his questions, she stood at the dark doorway of the room, smiling as she asked, “Mr. Chen, are you truly a novelist among the Hundred Schools of Thought?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “I’m not, but I have a friend who enjoys writing travelogues about landscapes, and he does it very well. I hope to share some experiences with him when we meet again in the future or jot down a few things to show him directly.”

She fidgeted with her skirt, hurrying to Chen Ping’an’s side. “May I sit?”

Chen Ping’an replied, a bit helpless, “This is your home, after all.”

She laughed and sat down, maintaining some distance from him.

A bit shyly, she said, “Mr. Chen, I must say upfront, I don’t have many stories to tell. You might be disappointed after listening. Also, can my name really appear in a book?”

Chen Ping’an smiled. “Of course! As long as you don’t mind. And after we finish chatting, be sure to remind me which stories can be written, which cannot, and which people and events to elaborate on or downplay. I will make sure to relay everything to that friend of mine.”

Her hands clenched tightly on her knees, her spirit brightening.

With a warm smile, Chen Ping’an looked at her, his gaze gentle and clear, as if he were seeing a good girl.

She quickly stood up, playfully bowing deeply, then sat back down, her face blooming like a flower.

As she recounted her stories, she recalled many people and events she had thought she had forgotten long ago.

Chen Ping’an diligently took notes.

Whenever she said she was tired, she would gaze intently at the accountant, who had a slightly pale complexion, as he focused on writing.

Finally, Chen Ping’an put away his pen and paper, cupping his fists in gratitude.

She covered her mouth and giggled, then quietly reminded him, “Mr. Chen, be sure to tell your friend to publish the book! If necessary, I can provide a few snowflake coins.”

Chen Ping’an frowned. “How can I accept such ill-gotten silver? Don’t worry; my friend has this covered. Besides, you should trust his writing ability; there will definitely be publishers willing to pay for it.”

After Chen Ping’an left, the gatekeeper, the old woman, was still smiling widely, unable to resist bouncing a little in place.

Only to suddenly realize her master was standing nearby.

She quickly composed herself.

To her surprise, the stern and severe master asked, “When you speak to Chen Ping’an again, tell him that I have a story with the Crown Princess Liu Chongrun that can also be written. As long as he’s willing to write it, I’ll give you a small summer coin as a reward.”

She timidly replied, “What if I can’t persuade Mr. Chen? Will you punish me, my lord?”

The Ma-surnamed ghost cultivator cursed and turned to stride over the threshold. “Then it means he’s blind and deaf, and it has nothing to do with you, you ugly old hag. Damn it, how can your trivial family matters compare to the grand loves and grudges I share with Liu Chongrun? Chen Ping’an isn’t a fool…”

At this point, the ghost cultivator coughed softly, turning back to say, “When you bring this up with Chen Ping’an, remember to speak nicely and coax him a bit.”

She nodded vigorously, feeling relieved.

Then she felt a bit puzzled. Huh? When did my master become so understanding?  
(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 459: Speaking from the Heart

In the room at the entrance of the Qingxia Island (Qingxia Dao) mountain gate, maps detailing the topography of Shujian Lake (Shujian Hu) and nearby cities were meticulously organized. Files of household registrations, records from various island patriarchs, and nearly two hundred thousand words of transcribed manuscripts were all neatly categorized. Most of these had been stored away in the drawers of cabinets, resembling the cluttered medicine drawers of a dusty apothecary. However, the desk remained piled high with papers.

The room contained only a desk, a row of cabinets against the wall, a dining table, and a few pieces of furniture: a single chair, two long benches, and a small stool—such were the meager possessions.

Since Gu Can had taken to visiting often, from late autumn to the onset of winter, he enjoyed sitting by the door for long stretches of time, either soaking up the sun and dozing off or chatting with the little mudfish. As a result, Chen Ping'an, while wandering on a visit to Purple Bamboo Island (Zizhu Dao), had asked the scholarly island lord for three bamboo stalks—two large and one small. The larger ones were fashioned into two small bamboo chairs, while the smaller one was turned into a fishing rod. Unfortunately, having made the fishing rod and being surrounded by Shujian Lake, he had yet to find the opportunity to fish.

That night, Chen Ping'an opened his meal box and quietly ate his supper at the dining table.

He was also waiting for a reply from Tai Ping Mountain (Taiping Shan) in Tongyezhou.

Even though Wei Ban had provided all the answers, it wasn’t that Chen Ping'an didn’t trust the elusive old deity of the Shenshui Kingdom; rather, the tasks ahead of him required meticulousness and earnestness, regardless of the circumstances.

However, cross-continental communication via flying swords was fraught with uncertainty. Given that Shujian Lake was a place of conflicts and misunderstandings, and that the flying sword messages had become the target of many, Chen Ping'an had already prepared for the worst. If absolutely necessary, he would ask Wei Ban for a favor, to send a letter on his behalf from Piyun Mountain (Piyun Shan) to Zhong Kui at Tai Ping Mountain.

If this were the first time Chen Ping'an had ventured into the martial world, he might have turned in circles, reluctant to trouble anyone despite having these connections, feeling somewhat uneasy. But now, things were different.

Chen Ping'an didn’t want to become the kind of solitary figure the old Taoist from the Eastern Sea spoke of. Owing favors wasn’t terrifying; it was a natural exchange. In the future, if friends faced difficulties, it would be easier to ask for help, as long as borrowing wasn’t more difficult than repayment.

After finishing his supper, Chen Ping'an packed up the meal box and unfolded a report at hand, beginning to browse through it.

The report contained some amusing anecdotes from Shujian Lake, similar in nature to the official reports sent to bureaucracies by local officials in the mortal kingdoms. Chen Ping'an had encountered such wondrous celestial reports back when he was staying at the Hundred Flower Courtyard (Baihua Yuan) in the Qingsong Kingdom. Having spent considerable time at Shujian Lake, he had adapted to local customs and had Gu Can help him obtain a celestial report. Whenever a fresh issue was published, it would be delivered to his residence.

Every day on Gongliu Island (Gongliu Dao), there were amusing stories that circulated throughout Shujian Lake by the next day.

This was largely thanks to a place called Liuxu Island (Liuxu Dao), where the cultivators—from the island lord to outer disciples, and even the servants—did not cultivate on the island but spent their days wandering around. Their livelihoods depended on their experiences in various places and the whispers they caught, selling snippets of information. They also sent sporadic celestial reports to half of the islands in Shujian Lake and to the four large lakeside cities: Chi Shui, Yun Lou, and Lu Tong Jin Zun. When there were few events, the reports were no larger than a tofu block, priced low, with a base cost of a snowflake coin. If many events occurred, the reports could resemble maps, costing several snowflake coins.

The recent report mainly discussed the happenings on Gongliu Island, highlighted some remarkable features of newly rising islands, and shared new developments from established islands. For example, the old patriarch of Biqiao Island (Biqiao Dao) returned from his travels with an astonishing young genius in cultivation, who had a natural resonance with talismans. Additionally, a previously unremarkable girl among the female cultivators at the Plum Blossom Waterfall Monastery (Meihua An) suddenly blossomed in beauty over the past two years, prompting the island to create a lucrative venture named "Mirror Flower, Water Moon." Unexpectedly, within the first month, crowds of wealthy patrons flocked to admire her elegance, showering her with considerable wealth, causing an increase in the island's spiritual energy. Moreover, Yunxiu Island (Yunxiu Dao), which had languished for a century and suffered a decline, saw a humble servant who was always underestimated rise to become the new Golden Core Earth Immortal after the renowned Tian Hujun of Qingxia Island. Consequently, Yunxiu Island, which was previously unqualified to attend the meetings on Gongliu Island, had started clamoring for a seat, declaring that regardless of who claimed the title of lord in the martial world, if Yunxiu Island were absent, it would be unjustifiable.

Chen Ping'an found these captivating stories about others quite entertaining and, after reading through them, couldn’t help but read them again.

Among these accounts, the report had reserved a palm-sized section for the girl from Plum Blossom Island, described using techniques akin to those used in the ferry crossings at Jiaojiao Mountain (Jiaojiao Shan). Coupled with Chen Ping'an's past experiences of observing a painter's skill on a ferry at Osmanthus Island (Guihua Dao), the report depicted the girl’s likeness vividly; she stood gracefully beneath a plum tree near the waterfall. After glancing at it a few times, Chen Ping'an confirmed she was indeed a charming girl, though he wondered if she had undergone any transformations through celestial "skin and bone exchange" techniques. If Zhu Lian and the old Xun were here, they would likely see through it instantly.

Chen Ping'an had bought the report relatively late, and while he looked over the many strange tales and local customs of the islands, he was unaware that prior to the tragic events at Furong Mountain (Furong Shan), all news regarding him, the accountant of Qingxia Island, had been the primary source of income for Liuxu Island.

Of course, Liuxu Island didn’t dare to exaggerate too much, as the report was filled with flattering words; otherwise, they would worry about Gu Can coming with that big mudfish and smashing the island flat. Historically, the cultivators of Liuxu Island had not gone without their share of misfortunes. Since the establishment of their patriarchal hall, they had relocated three times over five hundred years, and during the worst incident, they had suffered severe losses and financial strain, forcing them to rent a small piece of land from another island.

Three times they had “suffered for their words.” The first was in the early days of Liuxu Island, where an ill-considered report offended the illegitimate son of a martial world ruler. The second time, three hundred years ago, they angered the island lord of Gongliu Island; despite the flattering words in the report, the descriptions of the old immortal and his disciple attracted the attention of Liu Lao Cheng, who visited the island. Although no one was harmed, Liuxu Island was so frightened that they changed their island the very next day as an apology.

The third incident involved Liu Zhi Mao, whose title, "Cutting River True Monarch," was mistakenly altered to "Cutting River Celestial Sovereign," making Liu Zhi Mao the laughingstock of all Shujian Lake overnight.

Liu Zhi Mao retaliated by storming Liuxu Island and tearing down their patriarchal hall, marking the most critical injury Liuxu Island had suffered. When the stunned cultivators at Liuxu Island finally came to account for the incident, they discovered that the one responsible for the report, the culprit, had fled. It turned out he was a junior among numerous unjustly deceased spirits under a major cultivator on Liuxu Island, who had hidden for twenty years, causing immense trouble for the entire island with a single word. The cultivator responsible for checking the report's content, though truly negligent, was not the true instigator and was nonetheless pulled out as a scapegoat.

Chen Ping'an heard a rather rare knock on the door. From the familiar, scattered footsteps, he deduced it was Hong Su, the doorkeeper from Zhu Xian Mansion (Zhu Xian Fu).

He quickly got up to open the door. With her long hair and aged appearance, Hong Su declined Chen Ping'an's invitation to enter. After a moment's hesitation, she softly asked, "Mr. Chen, can’t you please write about my master and Liu Island Lord from Zhu Cha Island?"

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, "Alright, next time I visit your mansion, I’ll listen to the old tales of Ma Yuan Zhi."

Though Hong Su's face was old and lined with deep creases, and she harbored a thick aura of yin energy that made her appear unattractive, if she were to draw upon the spiritual energy of celestial money, she wouldn’t look bad at all. In fact, she possessed quite a pair of spirited eyes. At that moment, she blinked and, summoning her courage, softly asked, "Mr. Chen, are you deliberately rejecting my master? Is it because you guessed that he would send me again to seek your assistance, so I could earn such a great credit, right?"

Chen Ping'an raised a finger to his lips, signaling that it was a secret shared between the heavens, the earth, herself, and him.

Under the moonlight, the young woman smiled radiantly, the soft light illuminating her features.

Hong Su looked at the somewhat thin young man before her and raised a jug of liquor. The yellow paper seal and red string wrapped around the jug gave it a charming appearance as she gently smiled, "It’s not something precious—it's Huang Teng wine, made from glutinous rice and japonica rice. It’s the official wine from my hometown, favored by women, and is affectionately called meal wine. Last time, we spoke a lot, and I forgot to bring some. I just had some delivered to the island. If Mr. Chen likes it, I can bring more for you."

She suddenly realized her words might be inappropriate and quickly added, "What I meant was, the men in my hometown also like to drink it."

Chen Ping'an took the jug with a smile and nodded, "Alright, if I find it to my taste, I’ll come to Zhu Xian Mansion to ask you for more."

After Hong Su left, Chen Ping'an didn’t drink the wine but instead placed it among his belongings, hesitant to partake.

It wasn’t a matter of distrust towards Hong Su but rather an apprehension towards Qingxia Island and Shujian Lake. Even if there was nothing wrong with this jug of wine, should he later ask for something else, he wouldn’t know which jug might harbor a problem. Consequently, in the end, he would surely be left to tell the doorkeeper at Zhu Xian Mansion that the taste of the wine was too soft and didn’t suit him. In this regard, Chen Ping'an didn’t think he was too similar to Gu Can.

For the sake of that "what if," Gu Can would unhesitatingly kill ten thousand.

Chen Ping'an, too, feared that "what if," and could only temporarily set aside Hong Su's goodwill, putting it away for now.

Though they seemed similar, they were fundamentally different in nature.

As long as Gu Can continued to cling to her own beliefs, the heartstrings between her and Chen Ping'an were destined to remain taut, making it impossible for her to be drawn over to his side.

Chen Ping'an had already temporarily given up.

The two of them viewed the world from fundamentally different perspectives. No matter how much was said, it would be useless.

Thus, Gu Can had never witnessed the times when Chen Ping'an interacted with the four figures from the Lotus Flower Paradise (Ou Hua Fu Di), nor had she seen the undercurrents, the lurking dangers, and the eventual harmonious parting that would lead to a reunion.

Though it might not suit Shujian Lake and Gu Can, she had ultimately overlooked a possibility.

After gradually familiarizing himself with some of the complex, intertwined dynamics of Shujian Lake, Chen Ping'an believed that if Gu Can would invest some of her thoughts beyond killing, and perhaps learn a thing or two from Liu Zhi Mao about winning hearts and cultivating influence, she and her mother could live better and longer in Shujian Lake.

However, Chen Ping'an, having seen and thought about more, had already lost the will to speak of these “nonsense” matters.

Not speaking didn’t mean not acting.

On the contrary, it meant that Chen Ping'an needed to do even more.

Having explained as thoroughly as possible, Gu Can still failed to see her mistakes. Chen Ping'an could only withdraw and seek to prevent her from making further errors.

As long as he remained in Shujian Lake, living at the mountain gate of Qingxia Island as an accountant, he could at least strive to ensure that Gu Can wouldn’t continue to make grave mistakes.

Since Gu Can was unaware of her errors and firmly believed she was in the right, she would naturally not change her course. Chen Ping'an had repaid her kindness twice—once for a meal and once for a manual on martial arts.

On one occasion, because of past sentiments, he had no choice but to shatter his golden literary brush, enabling him to remain at Shujian Lake with the least amount of “guilty conscience.” Everything he did thereafter was to amend Gu Can’s mistakes.

This was a simple order.

Yet, putting it into action was not easy, especially the first step. Chen Ping'an had to persuade himself that the night he shattered the golden literary brush and bid farewell to the little figure in golden robes, it was a necessary price to pay.

In life, discussing principles seems easy yet is the hardest; the difficulty lies in those principles that require a price. Whether or not to discuss them hinges on one’s inner conscience, which must be interrogated and answered. If one decides to speak, then once spoken, the price paid is often unknown to others—one suffers the bitterness alone, unable to share with anyone.

Beyond these two matters, Chen Ping'an needed to mend his own mindset.

He couldn’t allow himself to crumble halfway through the process.

Stepping out of the room, Chen Ping'an remembered to extinguish the two lamps on the desk and dining table.

After passing through the mountain gate of Qingxia Island, he arrived at the dock, where his small ferryboat was tied. Standing by the lake, Chen Ping'an was dressed in a green robe, unburdened by the weight of a sword.

The world was tranquil, and no one was around. The lake appeared to be covered with shards of silver, while the night wind after winter’s arrival felt cool.

As Chen Ping'an practiced his martial arts, reaching the fifth realm—especially clad in his golden robe—he finally sensed the long-lost warmth and chill of the mortal seasons.

With each step deeper into the martial world, particularly as he witnessed more of the bureaucratic atmosphere and the mountain scenery, Chen Ping'an grew increasingly appreciative of Master Ruan’s views on the master-disciple relationship and admired Cui Dongshan’s lessons on the nuances of strategy.

Master Ruan took in disciples not to have them cheer him on during disputes or recklessly plunge into battle without discerning right from wrong.

Ruan Qiong had once stated, “I only accept those who share my path as students, not those who merely wish to serve me blindly.”

The difficulty of life lies in balancing one’s emotions, and even harder when it involves the most important people, who can leave you feeling unsettled.

Yet, this was merely the struggle of a good person.

In reality, most people never ponder such things.

When life strikes me a blow, I have every right to retaliate. If the world dares to beat me to a bloody pulp, leaving me feeling discontent, I will strike back at them with all my might, without a thought to whether the innocent will be harmed or if the guilty deserve their fate.

This is wrong.

To cultivate strength is to establish oneself, while cultivating the heart is the path to elevation.

On the path to greatness, whether traversing with a sword or pursuing academic study, one must occasionally yield the right of way to others.

Chen Ping'an wore a sorrowful expression, feeling as though the world was vast, but these words could only be bottled up inside, as no one would listen.

His thoughts stirred slightly.

After some contemplation, he took out a piece of charcoal from his belongings.
