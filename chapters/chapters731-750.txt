 ### Chapter 731: Confrontation

First, a man in a Confucian robe ascended the city wall and, with inexplicable divine abilities, instantly killed a large number of monster tribes. Following this, Xie Songhua summoned his bamboo box to wield his sword, completely destroying the life-bound flying sword of a monster swordsman at the Jade Purity realm. The latter immediately fell from his realm into the Nascent Soul stage, teetering on the brink of losing that stage as well. Whether he could still be considered a swordsman was now up for debate; after all, innate sword embryos are rare and hard to come by. It’s not as if one could easily cultivate a new sword just because their realm in sword cultivation was high and their life-bound sword was destroyed. Thus, this unfortunate monster, who was the first to strike, had suffered a tremendous loss during this siege, losing not only his realm but also the various premiums that came with the identity of a swordsman. To say he could easily switch to practicing other magical techniques and return to the upper five realms would be an understatement; he would no longer be a swordsman of the Sword Qi Great Wall, which was akin to reaching for the heavens.

The monster tribes' assault in the battlefield where Chen Ping’an, Liu Xianyang, and Qi Shou were located had evidently stalled.

According to the rules of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Xie Songhua had today made a significant effort with his sword, taking advantage of the time, place, and favorable circumstances, thus achieving a remarkable feat.

This accomplishment was no small matter; because the monster that he had ambushed and killed was one of the most precious swordsmen in the savage world, Xie Songhua could be considered to have slain half a celestial monster or equivalent to a complete Jade Purity realm monster. However, the choice between the two was ultimately up to the swordsman himself. If he chose the former, he would need to kill another half celestial monster to obtain corresponding spoils. Choosing the latter would lead to a small loss, but thankfully, he could immediately collect money and treasures from the Hidden Official.

Yet, it was clear that Xie Songhua was not finished; he still wished to strike again.

Qi Shou sighed, "All the good fortune has gone to Sword Immortal Xie; I need to be careful."

Decisively, Qi Shou summoned his last flying sword, the Jumping Pearl, creating a sword formation around him to prevent being ambushed by upper five realm monster swordsmen.

Turning to ask, "Did you get any share of such a big profit?"

Chen Ping’an sat cross-legged on the ground, pressing down on the long sword laid across his knees, and shook his head, "No."

As bait, he had received no additional profit.

Liu Xianyang laughed and asked, "Are you two friends?"

Chen Ping’an still shook his head.

Qi Shou sneered, "Friends? More like enemies. As soon as we step down from the city wall, this second shopkeeper would love to calculate my demise, and I wouldn't mind using my realm to crush him."

Liu Xianyang nodded, "That’s quite similar to our hometown, where the people are simple-minded."

In the savage world, there were numerous military supervisors and battle commanders. Once the monster army showed signs of stagnation in their assault, they would unleash a massacre.

Thus, in the battlefield where the three were, the monsters continued to charge forward. Not only that, but it seemed they had devised additional strategies, sending in a group of monster cultivators who understood talismanic methods, haphazardly throwing a bunch of yellow paper talismans in an attempt to obscure the battlefield's visibility. In no time, dust flew everywhere, and spiritual energy became chaotic. The leading line of monsters consisted of massive beasts, responsible for being the first to die, likely hoping to force Liu Xianyang to act more in order to find clues.

Qi Shou remained calm as he faced the onslaught. On the battlefield, the soaring kites and heartstrings flickered rapidly, as many towering monsters had their limbs severed by sword light, crashing to the ground with mournful howls.

Qi Shou had always been ruthless in battle, leaving behind no mercy, whether it was outright slaughter or skinning and flaying, refusing to show bare bones until he was satisfied. He would often leave opponents grievously injured but alive, letting them struggle on the battlefield, waiting for death, particularly those monster cultivators who could morph into human forms. They would frequently meet their doom beneath Qi Shou's flying swords, disemboweled and left to die. Should any monster cultivator show compassion and attempt to rescue them, they would meet a similar fate.

Chen Ping’an took a sip from the water elixir in his sword nurturing gourd and continued to strike at the enemies. He pursued a lethal blow with every attack; if a monster's body was too resilient, or if they survived after crucial acupoints were pierced, he would follow up with one or two more strikes from his needle-like sword, Thunder Pin.

During this time, there were indeed monster cultivators acting as concealed assassins, attempting to use secret techniques to restrain the flying swords, trying to perish together. However, in this game of deceit and disguise, Chen Ping’an was an expert. Also, the sword he wielded, Chuyi, was slightly slower and remarkably resilient. There had been one extremely concealed assassin monster who had deliberately sustained injuries, covered in blood and flesh, even using a monster as a shield against Chuyi. However, that sword merely pierced through the forehead of the monster in front of him before disappearing in a flash, retreating just as the monster's core shattered. The assassin, before dying, gazed blankly toward the city wall, seemingly confused. The sword that had not fallen into the trap and had merely been affected by the spiritual energy remained completely undamaged, but Chen Ping’an's mental energy had been significantly drained.

As Qi Shou had pointed out, over time, Chen Ping’an, who was not a swordsman, would find it hard to maintain the energy to keep attacking.

But right now, this was merely the opening act of the offensive and defensive battle.

However, Qi Shou was also well aware that when the swordsmen needed to leave the city wall to fight, Chen Ping’an would find it much easier.

Liu Xianyang still did not reveal his sword or life-bound flying sword, nor did he take action. From north to south, he was standing where Xie Songhua had been guarding, and regardless of how many came, they would all perish.

There was no reasoning to be had.

Chen Ping’an couldn't help but say, "Be careful; you might attract the attention of powerful monsters."

Liu Xianyang, with ripples in his heart lake, responded, "The greatest and only trouble with my swordsmanship is the height of my killing power, which is far from outstanding. Besides that, there’s no issue."

Then Liu Xianyang continued, "Listen closely; remember every word I say."

Chen Ping’an was about to speak when Liu Xianyang did not even look at him, laughing, "Stop wasting my time. When Liu Dajie speaks, you just listen. Just because I teach you all the mantras and tips, do you think you can learn them?"

Chen Ping’an fell silent.

Liu Xianyang continued to convey the mantras through thought, aware that Chen Ping’an had a good memory since childhood. Therefore, he explained the mantras as he spoke, not worried that Chen Ping’an would misremember, making his explanations extremely complex and tedious.

The content being discussed was precisely the ancestral sword scripture of Liu Xianyang's family.

Liu Xianyang's ancestral treasure consisted of two items; besides the sword scripture, there was also a set of old, tattered armor that had seen better days. Originally, it was a piece of bluish-black armor that had been obtained by the Xu family in Qingfeng City. After the head of the Xu family acquired the precious armor, he became a formidable Nascent Soul cultivator in the Baoping Continent, extremely powerful, and leveraged the indestructible armor to position Qingfeng City as a prime candidate for the next sect on the continent, second only to their ally, Zhengyang Mountain.

The Xu family could marry into the prominent Yuan family of the Great Li, even if it was the legitimate daughter marrying a side branch; in the long run, it was still a mutually beneficial marriage. The reason the Yuan family agreed to this unappealing marriage during the chaotic situation in Qingfeng City was largely due to the head of the Xu family's cultivation base and their potential to reach the upper five realms.

Liu Xianyang's plan back then was to sell the armor and keep the sword scripture. The price was to part with half of his life. If it hadn't been for the rules of the Lizhu Cave Heaven, that mountain-moving ape would have undoubtedly taken the other half of his life as well.

There was really no reasoning to be had.

However, Liu Xianyang had now become a scholar, and at that time, while lying on the sickbed in the Ruan family's sword shop, he had unexpectedly learned swordsmanship in a dream while on the brink of death. Thus, rules had to be followed, and grudges had to be settled, without hindering one another.

Liu Xianyang asked, "Did you remember everything?"

As he spoke, wisps of sword intent flowed around him as if providing him protection.

Chen Ping’an nodded, then said, "I think I won’t be able to learn it; the threshold is too high."

Liu Xianyang laughed, "Then just keep your mindset in check; don’t compare yourself to Liu Dajie in terms of talent. Is learning swordsmanship really that hard? To me, it’s just average, but to you, of course, it’s quite difficult. But speaking of which, what’s the biggest craft in our hometown? Isn’t it making porcelain? Didn’t we learn that too? So right now, you’re in a similar situation to when you first learned to make porcelain. Back then, you thought you could never master it and be a proper kiln worker? Frowning all day, being a gloomy person—look at how it is now! The emperor himself is begging you to help him create a few pieces of porcelain. Are you willing? It all depends on your mood, doesn’t it? My ancestral swordsmanship, of course, has a lot to it. You will learn slower than me, but you can still learn it; there’s no need to rush. In everything, you can’t be better than me, Liu Dajie; you need to accept that and get used to it."

Chen Ping’an whispered, "I’ve really gotten used to it."

Liu Xianyang laughed heartily, "Good habits don’t need changing!"

On the line where Chen Ping’an and Liu Xianyang were heading south, there was a large military tent surrounded by numerous guards, with a small inconspicuous wooden sign hanging at the entrance, simply stating "Jia Shen."

Inside the big tent were numerous desks filled with scrolls and documents piled high, including many heavily damaged military books that were not original copies but transcriptions. Even so, they were treated as precious treasures, and the monster cultivators would read these military texts with great care.

With fewer books available, those who read them cherished them more, willing to examine them word by word, reading deeply rather than just skimming.

The military tent occupied a vast area, with nearly a hundred monster cultivators gathered here, not due to their cultivated appearances or youthful looks, but because they were genuinely young.

Among them was a young swordsman named Bei Qiao, sitting cross-legged with his back against a sword rack.

Next to him was a peer named Yu Si, who was also a swordsman among the hundred swordsmen of the savage world, but like Bei Qiao, he still had no surname.

A boy lifted the curtain and stepped inside.

Yu Si looked up and smiled, "Tun Tan, how were the results this time?"

"Not as good as last time; I only destroyed three flying swords."

The boy held up three fingers, then shook his head, squatting beside Yu Si and Bei Qiao, grumbling, "It’s really hard to get close to the third sword formation. In my battlefield, if there was even a slight commotion, a celestial swordsman would come to stabilize the formation, protecting those unstable mid-five realm swordsmen. I almost got severed in half by a sword energy. It was very dangerous."

Then the boy's smile brightened, "But I’m not too far from the battlefield where Chen Ping’an is stationed. He’s neighbors with Qi Shou, and Qi Shou really did break through. He held the battlefield with just two flying swords; that was impressive. Later, a scholar emerged with a very strange technique, and anyone who bumped into him wouldn’t know how they died. Still impressive."

A girl sitting behind a desk glanced at a map and said slowly, "The celestial swordsman you encountered should be Situ Jixue, a Jade Purity realm swordsman from the wilds of Golden Armor Continent. His life-bound flying sword is called 'Iron Rider,' and he carries a sword named 'Heroic Pass.' His killing power isn't exceptionally outstanding, but he’s well-rounded and quite remarkable. To escape from under his sword is already quite a skill. Tun Tan, remember, military achievements can accumulate slowly, but don’t die. That battlefield of yours is under Mu Ji’s command. You’re one of the selected hundred swordsmen; if you die, it will implicate Mu Ji. He’s worked hard to get a chance to award you with a surname; don’t let it all go to waste."

A bashful boy sitting near the girl raised his head and said softly, "Don’t die. Otherwise, even if you get a surname, I’ll feel guilty for a long time."

The boy named Tun Tan grinned, "Got it."

The hundred swordsmen of the savage world are the designated seeds of the Dao by the Tuo Yue Mountain, and their importance is second only to the celestial monsters at the ascension stage.

Every swordsman, regardless of their current realm, was valuable.

If one were to die, both the Jiazi Tent and Tuo Yue Mountain would hold them accountable, and the penalties would be severe.

At this moment, there were more than five people inside the Jia Shen tent.

Tun Tan, Bei Qiao, Yu Si, the girl who had unveiled Situ Jixue's details, and a boy who was somewhat of a loner in the corner.

Mu Ji turned toward a desk, habitually speaking softly, "Have we found out about that Confucian disciple's root of techniques, especially whether or not he’s a swordsman? The losses in this small battlefield have already exceeded our expectations, and we need to respond appropriately. The prior attempt to send a celestial swordsman to assassinate Chen Ping’an has failed, but as long as your conclusions indicate we need to deploy another celestial swordsman, I’ll send a flying sword message to notify the swordsman to launch a sneak attack. If that fails, I’ll personally head to the ‘Jiazi’ main tent; you don’t need to feel pressured about that."

A man shook his head, "We still need to let more die to gather more clues."

Mu Ji nodded.

The girl said, "Chen Chun'an from Nan Po Sha Continent has personally come to the Sword Qi Great Wall. That scholar must be from the second sage line, and this is beyond doubt. In fact, we can allocate fewer troops to the battlefield he guards because over there, a concealed flying sword message will surely come soon. Once it’s confirmed from the Jiazi main tent, they will naturally inform us. If the message includes details about this person's identity, we still have two celestial swordsman slots left in the Jia Shen tent, so we might as well use them together. At that time, whether we kill that scholar or Chen Ping’an, or even take a step back to target Qi Shou, it will allow both celestial swordsmen to act according to the situation."

Mu Ji thought for a moment and nodded, "Viable."

Then the bashful boy took a piece of yellow paper from a stack, folded it into a small paper kite, and gently tossed it toward the main tent entrance, "Send the order down; on the sixth line of Jia Shen, ease the offensive. Aside from not allowing retreat, prioritize saving lives."

The paper kite flew out of the Jia Shen big tent.

The young swordsman with the strange name, Yu Si, joked, "Tun Tan, although you’re not at a high realm now, you have many tricks. If you get the chance, once the swordsmen leave the city wall, you should go meet that Chen Ping’an. Compared to me and Bei Qiao, who only know how to charge blindly, you’re much more likely to gain an advantage."

Tun Tan thought for a moment and nodded, "Let’s give it a try."

This Jia Shen tent was one of the sixty large tents named after the heavenly stems and earthly branches among the savage world's army. Besides the commands from the Jiazi main tent, each military tent specifically managed the dispatching of troops for a designated battlefield.

Since it could start with 'Jia,' it already indicated the importance of this tent. According to military law, even celestial swordsmen and monsters would be executed on the spot if they dared to trespass into a tent starting with 'Jia.'

Inside the Jia Shen tent, everyone performed their duties in an orderly manner, and overall, the atmosphere remained relatively relaxed.

The young woman who had the map open raised her head and said solemnly, "For our growth, and to secure several continents in the future for the Haoran world, we need to guard a few. Just saying, in the Jia Shen battlefield alone, we have already lost nearly ten thousand troops for nothing. Each of our contributions is inscribed on bones; don’t think this is a trivial matter."

A pale-faced boy sitting alone in a secluded corner sneered, "Troops? Can those brainless ants even be counted as troops? Their deaths are better; it helps us seize the timing and saves the army rations, killing two birds with one stone. Our savage world can't support so many useless people. Dying here is their rightful end; they’ve finally made a tiny contribution."

He glanced at Bei Qiao and Tun Tan nearby, "That Chen Ping’an, leave him to me. Anyone who dares to compete with me, don’t blame my flying sword for being blind and accidentally injuring allies."

It was indeed a Li Zhen who had transformed from a child into a young man, still possessing part of the ancient convict’s fragmented soul, and then reconstructed his body using the secret methods of Tuo Yue Mountain, ultimately piecing together a complete soul.

Bei Qiao remained unmoved.

Tun Tan still wore a bright smile, “No problem.”

Yu Si grinned, "I wouldn’t dare; I have no right to be an ally of Young Master Li Zhen."

That arrogant young man suddenly laughed, staring intently at Yu Si, "I advise you not to learn from the people over in the Haoran world, speaking in a strange, ambiguous manner."

Yu Si raised both hands, looking pitiful, "I’ll keep quiet, I’ll keep quiet."

Mu Ji frowned, raised his head, and with some seriousness, said, although still softly compared to Li Zhen and Yu Si's previous tones, "Li Zhen’s defeat was only by a line; Yu Si, that’s no reason to gloat. You are swordsmen of a higher caliber; you should have a higher mindset."

Yu Si immediately composed himself and nodded.

Then Mu Ji turned to Li Zhen and said, "Losing is losing; it’s your own inadequacy, Li Zhen. Being able to survive afterward is also your skill as a disciple of Tuo Yue Mountain. I won’t concern myself with that. I’m only responsible for the wins and losses of the Jia Shen battlefield. Every little fluctuation must be accounted for. In the coming fierce battles, you, Li Zhen, still need to obey orders. Ignoring military discipline and acting on your own will bring down the entire Jia Shen tent, and you’ll bear the consequences. But at the right time, if you still wish to seek out Chen Ping’an as an opponent and settle the score with him, even if it means exchanging lives, you are free to do so. The Jia Shen tent will not obstruct you. I personally would even be willing to use my share of the military achievements from the Jia Shen tent to help create an opportunity for you to face Chen Ping’an, because to fight alongside someone like Li Zhen, who dares to die again, is an honor for me."

Mu Ji looked around and said solemnly, "Why did Li Zhen go into battle? Why was he under the city wall fighting that Chen Ping’an? Don’t you all know? Do you even deserve to mock Li Zhen now just because he lost once and died once? If that’s the case, then for countless years, our savage world has never won a single battle, not even one! So many ascended predecessors, along with the entire Tuo Yue Mountain, are they not a joke?! If you have the ability, go to the Haoran world and mock the people there; you can mock them all you want!"

Mu Ji took a deep breath, his expression dimming as he muttered, "Saying these things to you doesn’t make me happy."

Li Zhen seemed to have listened to Mu Ji in this Jia Shen tent, truly no longer bickering with Yu Si and the others, closing his eyes to cultivate while refining five life-bound items.

The girl teased, "Mu Ji, your words are quite eloquent."

The young man, Mu Ji, smiled shyly, feeling a bit embarrassed.

Almost as if a mute, Bei Qiao spoke for the first time, "The flying sword from the Jiazi tent is coming soon."

Sure enough, a message flying sword arrived at the Jia Shen tent.

After Mu Ji read the confidential message, his expression became serious, "We only know that the scholar is named Liu Xianyang, a citizen of Baoping Continent, and not a pure Confucian disciple of the Chen family, so we still don’t know his foundational cultivation."

The girl sighed, "Then we should prepare for the worst and do whatever it takes to uncover the truth."

Mu Ji suddenly said, "Yu Si, you personally go to the battlefield. Remember to disguise yourself well; if you take a sword, exit the battlefield immediately without any hesitation. Chen Ping’an’s sword strikes aren’t that powerful, but his observations of the battlefield are meticulous. Knowing his temperament, I dare say he definitely has more than just that female celestial swordsman as a backup. As long as you survive on the battlefield, another celestial swordsman will soon be assigned to keep an eye on you."

Yu Si decisively stood up, eager to go, though he complained, "The retribution came so quickly."

Mu Ji turned his gaze toward Bei Qiao.

Yu Si dashed out of the Jia Shen tent without giving Mu Ji a chance to change his mind.

Mu Ji shifted his attention to Tun Tan, "I’ve calculated that with your current accumulated military achievements, you’re still quite a bit short to buy that Yiluohe precious item. No worries, I’ll take the lead and pitch in. In the future, whoever pays will receive dividends each year. Who else is willing?"

The girl shook her head, "I’m also saving money; I can’t contribute."

Mu Ji replied, "You can contribute. You’ll earn it back before the great battle concludes; trust me, it absolutely won’t delay your acquisition of that item."

Li Zhen opened his eyes and said, "Is it necessary to buy it? I can just go and ask for it directly."

Mu Ji shook his head, about to refuse.

Li Zhen had already stood up, addressing the girl, "Which one do you need? Just say it; I’ll bring it all back, no need for a second trip."

The girl, without hesitation, named the precious item, laughingly clasping her fists in thanks.

Li Zhen walked out of the Jia Shen tent expressionlessly.

Looking up toward the Sword Qi Great Wall, he could see the northern city wall, which was vague, but from the northern city wall, the battlefield was fully visible.

Li Zhen withdrew his gaze, paused for a moment, and turned around, rare enough to clasp his fists and bow in respect.

Beside Li Zhen was a burly man with a large beard, carrying a saber and a sword on his back.

The man nodded, "You go ahead and busy yourself."

Li Zhen rode the wind away.

Bei Qiao exited the Jia Shen tent, calling out to his master.

The man said, "Your master wants to see someone, so you, as his disciple, must do something for him: kill that Chen Ping’an."

Bei Qiao nodded silently. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 # Chapter 732: Sword Refinement (Part 1)

A resounding horn echoed across the battlefield, signaling the demon race's retreat. 

This skirmish, which had lasted for two weeks, ended with the demon army failing to breach the city walls. On the battlements, the sword immortals maintained their magnificent presence. The great demons from the wild lands were notably less active, with only a handful of ascendant and immortal-level great demons showcasing their powers—merely a few instances without truly engaging in battle. As such, they were overshadowed by the might of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

During this period, two battles stood out as the most remarkable. The first featured an individual named Zuo You, who wielded a sword with remarkable skill, going deep into enemy lines and nearly destroying a relatively forward military encampment of the Gengwu Army. This incited the involvement of two ascendant-level great demons. Yet, Zuo You did not falter; his sword energy surged forth, creating a vast expanse of white sword light. From the city walls, it appeared as if a miniature world had manifested, with endless streams of sword energy emanating from Zuo You, forming an immense half-dome that blotted out the sun. The demons that crossed this path found their bodies and souls shattered, reduced to mere dust.

On the Sword Qi Great Wall, Zuo You himself was nowhere to be seen. 

Only the sword energy and light remained visible.

Recently, the ascendant sword immortal Mi Hu, who had quietly broken through his bottleneck, stood beside his still-Jade Pith realm younger brother, Mi Yu. The two brothers felt differently about the situation. Mi Hu believed that Zuo You's sword energy could have been even more exhilarating; this was how a true sword immortal should be. In contrast, Mi Yu wore a pained expression, feeling that perhaps Zuo You's sword energy was a bit excessive. 

If Zuo You's tendency for solitary action was one side of the coin, then the other battle truly unfolded in the heavens, where Chen Chuan'an intervened, pulling down a round moon from the heights of the celestial canopy into the mortal realm. 

Panic swept across the entire wild world, with many fearing that the ever-growing moon would indeed descend upon them slowly. 

The gray-clad elder of the Moon Holding Mountain did not intervene; instead, he looked up and remarked with a smile, praising Chen Chuan'an's cleverness. 

Indeed, Chen Chuan'an was renowned for reaching new heights among the Ascendant Saints.

Beyond the Central Continent, on the eight great continents, the likes of Chen Chuan'an from the Posa Continent, the Fire Dragon from the North Julu Continent, and Liu Dacai from the Aiai Continent each had their strengths. Even the arrogant Qi cultivators from the Central Continent would not dare to dismiss the three pillars from these continents lightly.

The gray-clad elder allowed the peak ascendant great demon, who called himself the Master of the Lotus Flower Temple, to fully exert himself against Chen Chuan'an. 

This ascendant-level Taoist great demon had refined half a month's worth of moon essence, standing at a significant advantage in terms of timing and location.

However, he still could not prevent Chen Chuan'an's extraordinary techniques from bringing the large moon down toward the earth. 

The perceived slowness was, in truth, an illusion; only ancient deities or enlightened beings could truly comprehend the rapid descent of such a celestial body.

Outside the battlefield, the higher-level cultivators of the wild world, especially those approaching the Upper Five Realms, could feel the overwhelming suffocating presence of the moon and saw the moon palace's scenery. They could also discern lifeless mountain ranges, and the more perceptive Upper Five Realms cultivators could even spot desolate palace ruins and ancient bones, as well as enormous, suspended garments resembling lakes.

In the past, a military sage had once proclaimed a sentiment that leaned more towards flattery than criticism: "It’s a pity that the pure Confucian doesn’t dominate; his writings have failed to reach the heavens." 

Had this person witnessed Chen Chuan'an's efforts during this battle from the Sword Qi Great Wall, he surely would have reconsidered his statement.

As for the Sword Qi Great Wall's familiarity with the Nine Continents of the Wild World, it was not primarily with the Central Continent but rather with the Southern Posa Continent, close to the Suspended Mountain, and particularly with the pure Confucian Chen Chuan'an.

This was largely due to A Liang's fervent promotions, claiming that among scholars, Chen Chuan'an was an exceptionally unique figure—akin to a sage wielding a hammer, proficient in both literature and martial arts.

However, that moon ultimately was not completely pulled down to the mortal realm; the Master of the Lotus Flower Temple exerted all his strength, stalemating with Chen Chuan'an for a full half-hour.

Thus, that night, the round moon hung closest to the ground, exceptionally large and bright.

These two battles were undoubtedly the most fitting examples of divine beings clashing.

The Sword Qi Great Wall was greatly boosted in morale, with sword cultivators now drawing their swords even faster. The sword energy waterfall, which gathered tens of thousands of personal flying swords, surged even more violently.

However, this wave of offensive, compared to the rushing and dying demon army, saw relatively few demon cultivators truly engaging in battle.

As a result, the battle achievements amassed by the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall were mostly meager.

In this context, the female sword immortal named Xie Songhua from the Aiai Continent became a surprising standout, raking in significant battle achievements.

After the demon army ceased their offensive, they no longer left bodies on the battlefield exposed to the elements, as they had before, permitting some sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall to "pick up money" on the battlefield.

Instead, they began to respect the fallen demon cultivators, making efforts to collect the bodies and bones along with all their belongings, meticulously cataloging and returning them to their descendants.

The Sword Qi Great Wall, of course, would not allow the demons to sweep the battlefield with impunity.

The key point was that the demon army's temporary retreat was laden with significance.

One great demon held up a golden pot, intricately carved with a pattern resembling a mouse, and upon summoning it, all the spirited magical artifacts and treasures—these ownerless items—automatically left the battlefield to rush toward the golden pot.

Another great demon wielded a dark jade plaque sculpted in the shape of a dragon, and upon grasping it tightly, it emitted a brilliant light. Small black dragons, mere finger-lengths, slithered out from the plaque. Upon moving away from the plaque, they transformed into colossal beasts, their four claws crashing down heavily, easily kicking up dust dozens of feet high in an attempt to annihilate the sword cultivators retreating from the city walls.

Once, during an assault on the city, a great demon named Chong Guang summoned one of his personal treasures—a bowl of water. He blew a breath onto the surface, creating a deep vortex that shimmered like a starry river.

The souls of the demon cultivators on the battlefield began to funnel toward the south, attempting to merge with that water bowl.

Collecting souls could return them to the wild world beyond the battlefield or reserve them within the treasured artifacts, preventing them from being refined by the unyielding sword energy and intent of the Sword Qi.

The purest and most refined spiritual energy of heaven and earth seemed indifferent to people, but for cultivators attuned to the right timing and location, it presented a mysterious sort of affinity.

The ancient sword intent of the Sword Qi Great Wall was the best example of this.

However, the scattered limbs, severed corpses, and blood soaking into the earth would dramatically alter the battlefield's fortune.

The sword immortals had to intervene; they could not erase everything, but they would clear as much as they could. Otherwise, the "heavenly timing" that originally belonged to the Sword Qi Great Wall would shift towards the wild world.

This was the sword cultivators' strongest support aside from the primary sword immortals and the wall beneath their feet.

Thus, an unusual scene unfolded on the battlefield: although both armies had ceased hostilities, the actions of the great demons and sword immortals became increasingly frequent.

More and more treasures left behind on the battlefield and broken magical artifacts were being contested and retrieved by both sides. 

In the midst of this contention, many were shattered on-site.

However, compared to the previous confrontations between the two armies, the activity of the sword immortals and great demons, though grand, remained limited.

After the truce, a brief respite followed, with sword cultivators allowed some time to recover—typically half a fortnight at most, or a few days at the least.

Chen Ping'an did not immediately leave the city walls; he continued sitting cross-legged, observing the distant skirmishes between both sides.

Liu Xianyang approached and sat beside Chen Ping'an. He was about to reunite with his classmates and friends. This journey to the Sword Qi Great Wall primarily focused on "learning," and as for slaying demons, regardless of how the other disciples of the Ascendant Saints viewed it, Liu Xianyang was not overly concerned. If not for Chen Ping'an's presence, Liu Xianyang might not have been willing to engage in battle; he had always lived a more relaxed and carefree life than Chen Ping'an.

As for when they would leave the Sword Qi Great Wall, no one knew; it depended on Chen Ping'an's wishes. Liu Xianyang scratched his head, gazing into the distant battlefield where fierce sword lights flickered, and said, "All my battle achievements will count toward you."

Chen Ping'an hummed in acknowledgment and smiled as he handed over his sword nurturing gourd.

Liu Xianyang shook his head. "I won't drink it. Even if I'm thinking of getting wild after drinking, I need a pretty girl by my side, right?"

He had heard that this guy had recorded the Sword Immortal Seal Rubbing at the Sword Qi Great Wall and planned to ask Chen Ping'an to help him carve a pair of seals—one straightforward, inscribed with "Liu the Great Sword Immortal," and the other more sincere, saying "Liu Xianyang, who guards his virtue like jade."

Chen Ping'an quietly asked, "That demon cultivator, how did he manage to remain unharmed after you struck?"

Liu Xianyang laughed. "He's also a sword cultivator and has protective treasures; it’s not so easy to kill him."

Nearby, the area around Qi Shou was bustling. Many people gathered there, as Qi Shou had just broken through to the Nascent Soul realm right before the major battle began and was now guarding a region alone, which certainly warranted celebration.

As the leader of his small mountain, Qi Shou was quickly surrounded by dozens of friends, both male and female.

Some were familiar faces to Chen Ping'an, such as Ren Yi, the sword cultivator from the Dragon Gate who had first defended the gate in the streets. 

Then there was Pu Yu, the Golden Core realm sword cultivator responsible for guarding the second gate. He was a tall, handsome young man in white. 

A few female sword cultivators of similar age also gathered around to congratulate Qi Shou, though part of their motivation stemmed from wanting to see Qi Shou’s two charming neighbors. They were completely different from the highborn young ladies of the wild world, openly looking at Chen Ping'an and Liu Xianyang without hiding their interest. Their so-called whispers were anything but discreet.

On the Sword Qi Great Wall, during the previous shifts in the fierce battle, the familiar sword cultivators occasionally shared stories from other battlefields, including tales about the shopkeeper and the scholars from the Posa Continent. 

They had plenty to chat about. 

As for who among the sword cultivators had died and whose flying sword had been destroyed on the battlefield, it was mostly just a nod of acknowledgment, signaling that they were aware—nothing more.

Chen Ping'an shook his sword nurturing gourd and joked, "Isn't that enough? Are you still not drinking?"

Liu Xianyang hopped off the city wall, muttering, "I'm leaving, I'm leaving."

Once Liu Xianyang had gone, one of the female sword cultivators smiled and asked, "Shopkeeper, what’s your friend's name? Does he have a partner or a little wife?"

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Didn't you ask him when he was here?"

The girl giggled, "I was just too shy."

Chen Ping'an felt somewhat helpless; earlier, she had looked at Liu Xianyang as though he were naked, without a hint of shyness.

Her name was Situ Longqiao, a daughter of the Situ family from Tai Xiang Street, a bottleneck sword cultivator of the Viewing Sea realm, and a close friend of Dong Budie. Among sword cultivators of the same age at the Sword Qi Great Wall, she was of moderate level but had a bright personality and a strong sense of the Jianghu (martial world). 

The interesting events at the Sword Qi Great Wall often became more amusing through her colorful storytelling, and many rumors originated from her and Dong Budie's keen observations, with many truths seeming unbelievable while the lies felt more real.

Back then, when Dong Budie approached the Ning family, he had asked Chen Ping'an to help carve three book seals, one of which was for Situ Longqiao.

The shopkeeper was known for his integrity and fairness; Situ Longqiao swore that everything about him was true. 

"The dragon's eye is a fair statement; when it comes to spending money, Dong Budie's as free as flowing water, and after fighting, Wang Xinshi will say it's my responsibility."

She was now among the latest five great sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

In contrast, the previous five great sword cultivators included A Liang's exceptional gambling skills, the gentle temperament of the Hidden Official who never harmed anyone, the straightforwardness of the Old Deaf Man, the grace of Lu Zhi, and the sentimentality of Mi Yu, which weren't necessarily related to swordsmanship or cultivation.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an and Situ Longqiao could also be considered a meeting of experts. 

Situ Longqiao suddenly asked, "Is Yandang Mountain famous in the wild world?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "It's just an inconspicuous mountain on the Baoping Continent, with excellent feng shui, but it hasn't gained much fame yet. However, I have a good friend who travels the mountains and rivers and enjoys writing travelogues. He mentioned this place, praising its extraordinary scenery, including the Great Longqiao, which left a deep impression on me."

Situ Longqiao sighed, "I thought it was one of the famous Five Peaks."

She then smiled broadly. "No matter, it's still good."

Because the seal Dong Budie had given her contained a rare and intriguing inscription: "Resting at the Great Longqiao of Yandang Mountain, under the starry night, unable to sleep, I jump barefoot into the grass."

After receiving the seal, she had asked many friends with rich family libraries about the Great Longqiao of Yandang Mountain, but none could provide satisfactory answers.

Chen Ping'an recalled something and smiled, "But I have good news; Yandang Mountain is very likely to become the new East Peak of Baoping Continent, promoted to one of the Crown Prince Mountains. Its future fame should grow substantially."

Situ Longqiao was taken aback. "Crown Prince Mountain? What a ridiculous title."

Then she burst into laughter. "Well, it’s still good news."

Situ Longqiao turned back to Qi Shou and flew back toward the northern city.

Guo Zhujiu rushed over and squatted beside her master for a while, whispering, "Master, don't worry; I won't tell Mistress. Mistress is great, but I still lean more toward you."

Chen Ping'an chuckled softly. "You and Sister Situ are both fairies in my hometown."

Guo Zhujiu asked curiously, "Fairies? Do they fart? If they do, does it stink? Do they intentionally hold it in their skirts? Otherwise, they wouldn't be fairies, would they? If I were a man admiring a fairy, I couldn't stand that. So, if I were a fairy, I'd just hide under the quilt, secretly fart, lift the quilt corner, and fan the wind; it shouldn't stink too much."

Chen Ping'an had long since grown accustomed to Guo Zhujiu's whimsical thoughts. He took another sip from the magic gourd, feeling the nearly depleted spirit energy revive him slightly. He patted the little girl's head and stood up. "Let's go find your mistress."

The master and disciple headed toward Ning Yao.

Guo Zhujiu hopped along, unfortunately not carrying her small bamboo box, casually asking, "Master, how many great demons did you kill this time?"

Chen Ping'an laughed. "Just staying alive is quite good enough for me."

Guo Zhujiu quickly responded, "Master, have mercy; just leave their heads for now."

Chen Ping'an asked, "How's your father doing?"

Guo Zhujiu grinned, "I ran into him on the way and he allowed me to find you first; I'll head home later."

This simple phrase, about their "chance encounter," brought warmth to Chen Ping'an's heart, lightening his mood after experiencing such a large-scale battle.

Chen Ping'an was responsible for a central position on the battlefield, not too close to Ning Yao and the others.

Guo Zhujiu wasn't afraid of the distance; being with her master, going anywhere was good. Perhaps as they walked, little Junior Sister would surpass that not-so-tall big sister.

As they walked to the left, they passed by the Jade Pith realm sword cultivator Wu Chengpei, who still hadn’t drawn his sword once, using the entire battlefield as a whetstone to refine his sword.

The Sword Qi Great Wall housed countless unique personal flying swords, some transforming into the golden body of an ancient deity, some creating talismanic formations, others entwined with lightning, unleashing the Five Thunder Law upon their release. There were also two celestial sword cultivators with their flying swords, one transforming into a dragon and another named "Eye Opener." Together, they enhanced each other’s power to a level that rivaled the sword immortals themselves. 

Such variability was astounding.

No wonder the Sword Qi Great Wall needed no other Qi cultivators.

Pang Yuanji had not left the city walls either, accompanied by a girl who admired him, Gao Youqing, the younger sister of the Gao Ye Marquis.

Seeing Chen Ping'an and Guo Zhujiu, Pang Yuanji smiled and nodded.

Chen Ping'an made use of this opportunity, smiling and asking, "Brother Pang, how many great demons have you slain?"

Pang Yuanji replied with a grin, "About the same as you."

Chen Ping'an said, "You, a great earth immortal, shouldn’t be competing with a second realm cultivator; it's unbecoming."

Guo Zhujiu ran to Gao Youqing's side, stood on her tiptoes, and patted Gao Youqing's head with a kind expression, saying, "Youqing, remember, a married woman is like spilled water; you’re not married yet, so you must restrain yourself."

Gao Youqing swatted Guo Zhujiu's hand away, glaring, "Green End, stop talking nonsense."

Yet the girl’s gaze couldn’t help but drift toward the elegant Pang Yuanji in white.

Chen Ping'an and Guo Zhujiu continued on, with Chen Ping'an noticing a young man on the city walls passionately gesticulating and signaling Guo Zhujiu to be quiet.

However, just a few steps later, Guo Jianlong felt something was off and quickly realized who the kind shopkeeper was. Without hesitation, he called his friends and hastily flew back to the city.

Over by Ning Yao, two unfamiliar faces appeared.

They were Chen Shi, a disciple of the pure Confucians, and Qin Zhengxiu, a gentleman from the school at the base of the Posa Continent.

Neither of them had engaged in demon slaying like Liu Xianyang; it was simple: they weren’t sword cultivators, and the demon army had no chance of approaching the city walls, so they couldn’t be of help. Moreover, the sword cultivators’ techniques relied on tight coordination and impeccable execution, while Chen Shi and Qin Zhengxiu's spells and abilities, despite their great power, could easily become a hindrance.

Thus, the two close friends were primarily there to explore, walking along the city walls before returning to greet Chen Sanqiu and the others during a lull in the battle.

Having previously taken the "Righteous Qi" from the Sword Qi Great Wall, the pure Confucian gentleman had quickly become close friends with Qin Zhengxiu, and they had both entered the ranks of gentlemen at the same time.

That gentleman hoped that Qin Zhengxiu would send his regards.

Qin Zhengxiu was chatting with Die Zhang.

Die Zhang was discussing the intricacies of the recent battle, explaining that the Sword Qi Great Wall didn’t need to rush to maximize their casualties early on. Instead, they would gradually tighten the front lines to slowly whittle down the demon army. Yet, should the moment of urgency arrive with the demon army at their doorstep, many sword immortals would leave the city walls to firmly hold the front lines, cutting the battlefield while the earth immortal sword cultivators led the charge down to engage the demons.

The lower-ranked sword cultivators of the Middle Five Realms would only need to defend the city walls.

Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo were crouched to the side, watching the excitement while secretly laughing, mimicking the shopkeeper’s stance, as if they were farmers observing the harvest.

It was rare to see Die Zhang speaking softly and quietly with others.

Ning Yao closed her eyes to meditate.

After Qin Zhengxiu introduced himself and mentioned his relationship with the pure Confucian gentleman, Ning Yao rarely spoke more, leaving the crowd to independently nurture her sword intent.

Dong Huafu was chatting with Fan Dazhe about what to eat and drink upon returning to the city. Dong Huafu praised Fan Dazhe for his commendable performance and suggested buying a jug of Qing Shen Mountain wine to celebrate.

Suddenly, Chen Shi spoke up, "There should have been a traitorous sword cultivator who, at the cost of a personal flying sword, secretly sent messages to the demon race."

This was not a particularly popular assertion.

This was likely one of the reasons why Chen Shi found himself at odds with many as soon as he left his family.

However, Ning Yao and the others showed no unusual expressions.

"Whether it rains or the daughter gets married, the shop must make money. Who can stop that?"

Dong Huafu turned to say, "To survive, one must at least pay the price of a personal flying sword. I’ve heard that ordinary scholars who don’t cultivate have considerable knowledge, but they can’t endure pain. What’s that saying? Without a knife at home, no well in the backyard, it looks too ugly to hang oneself—too hard and cold water?"

Qin Zhengxiu furrowed his brow.

Chen Shi instead laughed, "There are indeed such sayings. We can’t help it; there are simply too many scholars in the Righteous Qi World, both good and bad, and all types of people."

Dong Huafu cast a glance at the young scholar and nodded, "You’re quite agreeable; treat me to a drink later."

Chen Shi found it amusing and asked, "Aren't you the one treating me?"

Dong Huafu chuckled, "Dazhe, come on."

Fan Dazhe immediately replied helplessly, "Even shopkeepers can't make Dong Heitan spend money."

Qin Zhengxiu turned to see two newcomers approaching—one was a young man in a law robe from the clothing workshop, carrying a long sword from the sword workshop, his face pale and resembling a sickly person lacking combat prowess. But thanks to Liu Xianyang, Qin Zhengxiu recognized him as Chen Ping'an from the Baoping Continent, now a direct disciple of the Confucian sage, and the younger junior brother of the sword immortal Zuo You. Previously, when Liu Xianyang and Chen Ping'an had fought side by side, Qin Zhengxiu had been thoroughly impressed, realizing that Liu Xianyang had hidden talents. Even Chen Shi, who had a good relationship with Liu Xianyang, was discovering for the first time that Liu Xianyang was a sword cultivator.

Chen Ping'an smiled and bowed. "Greetings, gentlemen."

Qin Zhengxiu and Chen Shi returned the bow in kind.

Dong Huafu muttered, "A disciple of the Ascendant Saints meeting a disciple of the Confucian sage; even if they don’t fight, they should at least argue."

Ning Yao opened her eyes and said, "I’m off."

Chen Ping'an summoned his talismanic boat and stepped onto the ferry.

Qin Zhengxiu and Chen Shi declined Chen Ping'an's invitation, saying they wanted to stroll around the Sword Qi Great Wall a bit longer.

The talismanic boat headed north.

On the ferry, aside from Chen Ping'an, everyone else was a sword cultivator.

Chen Ping'an and Guo Zhujiu sat to one side, rowing vigorously. 

Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo were on the other side, also putting in effort.

Dong Huafu shook his head. "This is embarrassing."

Fan Dazhe wholeheartedly agreed.

Over on the city walls, Qin Zhengxiu watched the scene unfold. 

On the ferry, aside from Chen Ping'an, everyone was a sword cultivator but none were using their swords.

Chen Shi laughed and said, "Liu Xianyang often brags about how clever your hometown’s Chen Ping'an is, how quickly he learns. Aside from being a bit taciturn and not loving to talk, he seems to have no faults. At first, he confidently assured me that Chen Ping'an would become the best kiln worker in the world. Later, Liu Xianyang stopped mentioning the dragon kiln."

Qin Zhengxiu remarked, "Perhaps Liu Xianyang himself didn’t expect that Chen Ping'an would become a disciple of the Confucian sage."

Chen Shi glanced at the receding talismanic boat. "I guess Chen Ping'an didn’t anticipate that Liu Xianyang would become a sword cultivator either."

He sighed, "My sister once said that the Li Zhu Dongtian in the Baoping Continent is a land of heroes and spirits; it’s a treasure of feng shui."

Inside the Jia Shen tent, the sword cultivator Yu Si entered. Aside from Li Zhen, everyone’s gaze turned toward him.

The young man in wooden sandals inquired, "How is it?"

Yu Si smiled, "This is impressive. I can tell he’s a sword cultivator, not a Confucian practitioner cultivating righteousness; his swordsmanship is exceedingly profound."

At this point, Yu Si raised his arm, a faint scent of blood wafting out. "Look, the law robe is completely unharmed."

Yu Si rolled up his sleeves, revealing bloodied and mangled arms that had been wrapped in several golden pages. He chuckled, "Lucky I had some protective items; otherwise, even if I didn’t die, I’d have lost a layer of skin to his undetected sword intent."

The boy in wooden sandals asked, "How did Liu Xianyang strike?"

Yu Si shook his head. "I'm afraid I really don't know; he came out of nowhere… It felt like just a glance from the seniors would give me goosebumps."

The boy frowned. "Was Liu Xianyang's sword energy too fast, so fast that it could pierce through the rivers of time without causing any ripples? For example, Qi Shou, who just broke through, his flying sword named Heart String has the innate ability to minimize the natural resistance of time on the sword, thus making it extremely fast. Or is Liu Xianyang's personal flying sword even more unusual?"

A young woman interjected, "The Great Sword Immortal Han Huaizi from the North Julu Continent and a new sword immortal from the Tai Hui Sword Sect, Liu Jinglong, both possess exceptionally intricate and strange personal flying swords. Although I don't know their names, one is known as 'Near the Path.'"

Yu Si shook his head with a smile, shaking his arm, feeling a bit of pain for those few golden pages that had been destroyed. "His realm shouldn’t be that high; he definitely isn’t an Upper Five Realms sword immortal. It’s just that his swordsmanship is quite peculiar."

A communication flying sword arrived at the Jia Shen tent.

After reading the confidential message, the young man in wooden sandals revealed a smile.

Inside the tent, everyone shared a look of amusement.

The young man in wooden sandals stood up, walked around the desk, and with his fingers together, drew a circle in the air.

Within the tent, a large scroll about ten feet high appeared suspended.

He spoke in a serious tone, "The Gui Wei tent has sent intelligence to all the military tents. This is the distribution map of the Sword Qi Great Wall’s stationed forces, detailing the approximate duties of each Upper Five Realms sword immortal, their relatively fixed positions, which are all noted in the letter. In addition, the powerful Nascent Soul sword cultivators and all the significant Golden Core sword cultivators are also specifically documented, particularly focusing on the youngest geniuses like Ning Yao, with some Dragon Gate and Viewing Sea cultivators marked individually."

He began to announce the names of important sword immortals and cultivators, including their positions and specific duties for defending the city. Every time he mentioned a name, the young woman would write it down on the scroll. Fortunately, everyone inside the Jia Shen tent had keen eyesight; even if their realms were not high, they could clearly read the small writing on the scroll.

The names on the scroll were color-coded: gold, vermilion, and black, corresponding to Upper Five Realms sword immortals, Nascent Soul sword cultivators, and all Middle Five Realms sword cultivators, including Golden Core.

The young man in wooden sandals emphasized, "Anyone whose name appears here, even if they seem insignificant with black ink, the lower their realm, the more we need to find opportunities to eliminate them."

The young woman responded, "Then I will circle these special names in gold ink?"

The young man nodded. "Yes, for instance, the daughter of sword immortal Guo Jia, Guo Zhujiu, and the younger sister of the Gao Ye Marquis, Gao Youqing."

On the scroll, there were the ten pinnacle sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, alongside prominent figures like the great sword immortal Yue Qing, the head of the Yao family, Yao Lianyun, and the great sword immortal Li Tui from the North Julu Continent.

In previous sieges, the great demons of the wild world had not overlooked such details, but regardless of considerations, they could never keep pace with changes.

This time, the wild world had sixty military tents, including the Jia Shen tent, housing nearly five thousand cultivators. While the Jia Shen tent focused exclusively on their territory's battlefield situation, many other military tents needed to address specific major matters.

This was because the Jia Shen tent was relatively special, having too many potential sword immortals that they didn't need to worry about distractions. The Suspended Mountain’s Li Zhen, Bei Qi, Yu Si, and the young female sword cultivator Liu Bai, all five of the sword cultivator seeds gathered from the wild world, were present here.

In other military tents, such as the Gui Wei tent, they needed to pay extra attention to the movements of the main sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, recording the strikes of every sword immortal on the city walls—why they struck, whom they struck at, the power and lethality of their strikes, whether they broke through their realms, and critically, whether they had purposefully held back their strength. If they did, they would be marked for review, observing whether their future performance on the battlefield would remain "courteous." If the answer was affirmative, it would lead to a reduction in the forces stationed at the corresponding military tents, ensuring that their offensive was not overly aggressive but also not too obvious. Otherwise, if both sides reached a tacit understanding yet the Sword Qi Great Wall saw through their intentions, there would be dire consequences for the sword immortal involved, especially given Chen Qingdu's temperament.

In this way, setting an example would deter the sword immortals from secretly showing goodwill.

The Xin Mao tent was responsible for the specific allocation of all Upper Five Realms cultivators within their own army to other military tents on the battlefield.

The Geng Yin tent managed military supplies. The Yi Wei tent was in charge of leading the subsequent forces to their predetermined positions behind the battlefield, setting up camp and preparing to move to the battlefield at any time, while also arranging appropriate advance routes.

As for why the pinnacle great demons of the wild world seemed mostly absent, aside from a handful, it was because they were all very busy. Launching an all-encompassing assault on the Sword Qi Great Wall was unprecedented in the history of the wild world. Behind the battlefront, numerous unruly factions did not obediently follow orders. 

Some particularly powerful great demons truly lacked judgment and thus needed to be suppressed. Additionally, many feigned compliance while secretly hiding their resources, and the most troublesome were the sword immortals who refused to act as proper sword immortals, instead taking on the roles of insidious assassins. They specifically targeted the leaders of the advancing demon forces in the north, hindering each troop's movement.

When a sword immortal was determined to kill and flee, it posed a tremendous problem.

Defeating a cultivator and killing a cultivator were worlds apart.

Why did they know Chen Ping'an was baiting them, yet the Jia Shen tent still wanted to kill him? Because Chen Ping'an had killed Li Zhen, which was not as simple as merely winning; a being like him, once fully grown, would become a massive headache, making it worth the Jia Shen tent's investment of an Upper Five Realms sword cultivator to target him. However, at that time, they had insufficient information, and without accurately evaluating the methods and lethality of the Aiai sword immortal Xie Songhua, the Jia Shen tent paid a heavy price, with the young man in wooden sandals unhesitatingly taking the blame for this oversight, even though it might cost him a chance to have his lineage recorded and named by the Suspended Mountain.

In war, people die—many people. It’s not a game. As long as they win, everything can be rectified casually. However, if they lose, the future rulers of the wild world will be uncertain.

The territory of the wild world was likely two times larger than that of the Righteous Qi world.

In comparison to the relatively prosperous Righteous Qi world, the wild world, in many ways, resembled a hollow shell—its lands barren and its resources scarce. 

While it certainly had unique advantages, it still paled in comparison to its neighbor.

Yet this enormous disparity was drawn from comparing one whole world against another.

Moreover, the demon race reproduced rapidly and expanded their lineage.

In addition, demon cultivators faced virtually no moral restraints.

There were also vast dynasties occupying extensive territories, possessing fertile lands that other factions coveted, and many spiritually rich locations rumored to rival the Righteous Qi world and the Qingming world in terms of their blessed lands.

Yu Si took a swig of cheap liquor, wiped his mouth, and laughed. "That Chen Ping'an, I caught a few glimpses of him on the battlefield. As Tu Tan said, very cunning; going against him in battle is quite troublesome."

Li Zhen replied, "The opponent's realm has dropped, and since he isn’t an innate sword cultivator, his current strikes must be quite strained. He’s managed to hold down his territory thanks to the support of Liu Xianyang and Qi Shou. Even so, calculating the lethality of his flying sword and the enemy's combat strength, paying attention to details, and engaging in a war of attrition are his strengths."

The young woman added, "To deal with this guy, we must form a crushing advantage."

The young man in wooden sandals asked, "So how about we attempt an encirclement? Li Zhen, you focus on the attack, Yu Si helps suppress him, while Tu Tan takes care of cleanup. Whether it works, we can try it out and see."

Beike suddenly said, "Replace Li Zhen with me."

Li Zhen's expression darkened.

Beike added, "It’s my master’s intention."

Only then did Li Zhen’s expression brighten a little.

Among the great demons at the peak of the wild world, even the notorious master of the bleached bones, Bai Ying, or the Lord of the Yaluo River, faced heavy criticisms.

Only Beike's master was a more easily seen figure; he roamed the world year-round, having no sect or residence, yet rarely faced any controversy. 

It was often said that if he had been willing to fight in that thirteen-person conflict, there would have been no subsequent troubles in the two siege battles.

Yet, he had directly refused. 

Two great demons who had broken their oaths perished, while several sect disciples lost their minds and sought revenge against him.

As a result, he never drew his sword, casually obliterating the leading Jade Pith realm demon with just a single punch, or so it was said. 

The other cultivators were all slain one by one by that young rogue sword cultivator Beike, leaving only a few fortunate ants to escape back to their respective sects, carrying messages before hurriedly returning to apologize. Eventually, the two Jade Pith realm demons became good subordinates to the master and disciple, serving them for several years and helping Beike nourish his sword.

The rule of the wild world was simple, straightforward: the bigger the fist, the more reason one holds.

If the wild world had its own authoritative history, every page would be drenched in blood.

Many factions, having barely formed the shape of a dynasty or a great nation, were trampled and destroyed by the capricious peak great demons. 

Many capitals painstakingly built over generations by various monarchs could be turned to ruins in a single night, strewn with blood.

For example, the bleached bone great demon Bai Ying and his six trusted generals were notorious for converting vast territories into cemeteries, all reduced to skeleton puppets and raising them like insects, ultimately leaving only a few usable materials.

Only sword cultivators, regardless of their level, could survive the various inexplicable disasters.

Because this was the rule set by the Suspended Mountain.

The seeds of sword cultivators in the wild world were treated even better than the seeds of scholars in the Righteous Qi world.

This was indeed the most curious matter; the common enemy of the wild world was the Sword Qi Great Wall and its sword cultivators.

Yet no matter how the wild world attempted to besiege the city and how dismal their attempts became, they maintained a pure respect for the sword immortals and sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

In the heat of battle, they showed no mercy.

Once the battle concluded, demon cultivators who had personally experienced the conflict might harbor deep-seated hatred toward the sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall, yet none would dare to curse or disparage them.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 733: Sword Forging (II)**

Ning Yao returned to the Ning residence alone, claiming she needed to enter seclusion to forge a sword.

The others spent the evening drinking at the Stacked Peaks Tavern, where Fan Dacheng had already resigned himself to his fate of treating everyone after borrowing money. The drinking session progressed quickly; Chen Sanqiu and the others had already gone home, while Guo Zhujiu flew over rooftops to see the little bamboo box he hadn’t seen in a long time, feeling a deep sense of longing.

In the end, only the tavern's head steward, the second steward, and a crowd of thirsty patrons remained. Business was bustling, and Chen Ping'an squatted by the roadside, drinking. 

To his surprise, Yu Jianfu and Zhu Mei had also come over to drink.

Yu Jianfu held a wine jug and approached Chen Ping'an. The sword cultivator, who had been joking with the second steward, immediately laughed and made way, one more considerate than the other.

Yu Jianfu sat down on the steps beside him, while Zhu Mei stood nearby, her demeanor lacking the heroic flair that Sister Xi had in the martial world, something that was hard for a young girl to learn.

Yu Jianfu asked, “Chen Ping'an, your boxing techniques aren’t widely known in the Baoping Continent?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Very few people learn it, just a handful. If we measure by the number of practitioners, it’s a minor boxing style. But in terms of the depth of boxing intent, it’s a major style.”

Yu Jianfu nodded, “Chen Ping'an, strive to enter the Realm of Far Journeys soon. Whether you and Cao Ci are considered geniuses or not, it’s not a bad thing if you’re ahead on the martial path, at least for me. Don’t be like those practitioners on the mountains, walking on a narrow path alone.”

Chen Ping'an raised his wine bowl and smiled, “Let’s encourage each other.”

After finishing his drink, Yu Jianfu left with Zhu Mei.

Chen Ping'an called out to the child Taoban before returning to the Ning residence. Upon reaching the entrance, he suddenly told Bai Momo, who was waiting, that he needed to return to the city wall for a moment.

He boarded the spirit boat and left the city, passing by the private residences of various sword immortals below.

Upon reaching the city wall, he first sought out his senior brother, Zuo You.

After sharing his thoughts, Zuo You smiled, “It’s best that you think this way; it saves me some trouble. With your current level of cultivation, what can you achieve? Ultimately, the direction of the greater situation will unfold as it should. Your small adjustments are nice but limited in their usefulness. However, before we get to that, I have a question for you. Setting aside realms and identities, just consider a possibility: if you were to die here, would it protect the Sword Qi Great Wall? Would you choose to die?”

Chen Ping'an fell silent.

Zuo You continued, “Anyway, it’s just an impossible possibility, so whatever answer you hold in your heart is yours to know. Don’t strain yourself too much; how can you contend with heaven and earth? Don’t think that overthinking is necessarily a bad thing. As Confucians say, there is a sequence to things, beginnings and ends; knowing the order is the way to approach the path. Buddhism teaches gradual enlightenment and sudden insight. Daoism speaks of accumulating knowledge like grains of millet. Take your time.”

Chen Ping'an gazed southward at the battlefield, softly replying, “Senior brother’s teachings will be etched in my heart.”

Zuo You recalled something and said, “In learning, you must not be negligent. I’ll give you two more little questions to ponder. Why do Buddhism and Daoism differ so much in their approach to sculpting statues of deities? And regarding the four great Bodhisattvas of Buddhism—wisdom, compassion, practice, and vow—if you were to follow the order of your teacher, which comes first for the best outcome? Is it wisdom first, leading to compassion, generating great vows, and then practicing? Or is it compassion first, making vows, and gaining wisdom through practice? Think about it.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Understood.”

Then he forced a bitter smile, “Senior brother, these are not small questions at all.”

Zuo You replied, “To me, they’re small questions. To your teacher, they’re not even issues.”

Chen Ping'an took his leave and, feeling a slight shift in his heart, decided not to visit the old sword immortal. Instead, he found himself confronted with another task.

Zuo You frowned, “Can’t you be a little more straightforward? Must you keep making things difficult for my little junior brother?”

If it weren’t for the old sword immortal’s high skills, Zuo You would have said something snarky.

Chen Qingdu approached Zuo You, hands clasped behind his back, grinning, “Having the highest sword skills is great; it keeps me feeling refreshed every day.”

Chen Qingdu’s gaze fell upon a remote small realm.

Inside this small realm was a proper academy, where a man in Confucian robes was imparting knowledge to a group of young students.

He began by discussing the foundational aspects of poetry, using the lines “The sun sets behind the mountains” and “Spring grass grows by the pond” as examples, explaining how these seemingly simple phrases actually capture the essence of nature and leave little room for later generations.

This scholar, known as Zhou Mi, was backed by a screen painted with exquisite landscapes, while his desk was cluttered with books and scholarly items, including the Four Treasures of the Study and various small tools.

The more extravagant the spiritual artifacts, often mere trinkets from the common cultivators or wealthy clans in the wild world, the more they were revered as treasures by many demon cultivators from the savage realms.

Zhou Mi was actually the second-highest-ranking major demon in the Abyss of Ancient Wells, second only to the gray-robed elder, and even ranked higher than the burly man Liu Cha who carried a sword on his back.

He was regarded as the “Ocean of Learning” in the wild world, the Mount of Moonlight in the realm of knowledge.

He was well-versed in a wide array of subjects, excelling in Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, as well as poetry, calculations, calligraphy, painting, and phonetics.

Zhou Mi referred to himself as an old bookworm and was known as the Old Fox of Heaven.

Among his students were Shoucheng, Cai Ying, Tong Xuan, Tong Yin, Yu Zao, and Liubai from the Jia Shen account, all of whom were now considered top seeds among the Sword Immortals.

Furthermore, a significant number of his earlier disciples had become notable figures in the realms of military, commerce, and the arts.

All students under Zhou Mi’s tutelage had to wait until they broke through the Sword Qi Great Wall to be given their surnames.

In fact, the one responsible for compiling this genealogy was Zhou Mi himself.

Legend has it that the ancient demon Bai Ying once curiously asked, “Is Mr. Zhou aiming to become the head of education in our world?”

Zhou Mi replied with a smile, “Not enough.”

Today, Zhou Mi once again shared some trivial wisdom about being naive in life and worldly in deeds, and it went on for nearly half an hour.

He often first asked his students for their answers, and as the esteemed teacher, Zhou Mi would then provide his own. If anyone offered a particularly astute answer, he would directly reward them with a scholarly item; today, he gifted a student a seal inscribed with “Endless Streams and Mountains.”

When Zhou Mi first began teaching, he openly told all his first-generation students that the scholars of the Great Harmony had ceased to value principles, and there were reasons for this. The complexities of right and wrong, good and bad, were very intricate. However, the scholars of the wild world had yet to reach such a level; they simply lacked the qualifications to claim everyone is right because their foundation was too poor. Thus, at the beginning of their studies, they needed to harbor respect. All of Zhou Mi’s students had only one task: to copy the classics of a hundred schools each day.

Today’s final question was about the relationship between people and time.

This touched upon a fundamental principle. Zhou Mi firmly believed that the demon race had gained enlightenment, transforming into human forms, but only those who read books could truly be considered human.

With a smile on his face, Zhou Mi began to elaborate on his thoughts.

Before the age of ten, time flowed like a gentle stream, so slow that it felt like one would never grow up, unable to see the distant scenery.

After twenty, one hardly cared about the passage of time, indifferent to its speed; even a moment spent looking around seemed wasteful.

By thirty, time began to sprint, catching people off guard.

By forty, it resembled a mighty river rushing towards the sea.

After sixty, it transformed again into a tranquil lake, motionless.

At the moment of death, it felt like a waterfall suddenly plunging into a deep pool.

Some students understood this concept well, while others seemed indifferent.

Zhou Mi didn’t differentiate; he simply smiled and said, “The purer the knowledge appears, the less substantial its meaning seems. However, in my opinion, true authority in the world isn’t about holding a high position or having a strong fist, but rather how deeply one can truly influence the hearts of others. If you can absorb this, great; if not, it doesn’t matter. As long as you have a skill to stand by, you will always have opportunities to rise step by step. The path of the Great Way is truly magnificent; once you reach the Great Harmony, you may pick as you please.”

As Zhou Mi spoke, he turned to gaze at the painted screen, which was actually focused on a certain spot on the city wall of the Sword Qi Great Wall, smiling as he said, “Don’t claim that heaven is high and has no ears or eyes; don’t say that the earth is thick and has no compassion.”

Chen Qingdu laughed, “You still have a long way to go to establish your teachings.”

As night fell, a somewhat awkward man entered through a newly opened gate in the Hanging Mountain, coming from the Sword Qi Great Wall to the Respect Sword Pavilion.

Accompanying him was Yan Zuo, who had cast an illusionary spell, and Yan Ming, the head of the Yan family, who had conducted business across continents in the Great Harmony for countless years.

The Respect Sword Pavilion had already closed its doors to customers, so only the two of them walked through, with the awkward man starting to collect the paintings of the sword immortals one by one.

The head of the Yan family said, “Chen Ping'an, please help carve a seal. I’ll have Yan Zuo deliver the blank seal to the Ning residence later; I’ll pay you two grains of rain. You don’t need to think of the inscription; just write five words: ‘Entering the City is Like Visiting a Grave.’”

As Chen Ping'an folded up a painting, he thought for a moment and asked, “Can I add five more words?”

Yan Ming laughed, “What do you mean?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “When drawing the sword, it’s like offering wine.”

Yan Ming paused for a moment, then nodded, “I won't let you add five words for free; that’ll cost you two grains of rain.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Uncle Yan, no need for payment.”

Yan Ming asked, “Is it too little, so you’d rather not have it?”

Chen Ping'an was left speechless.

Yan Ming gestured for Chen Ping'an to continue his work, remaining indifferent as he said, “Scholars who can strike with fists and swords at the Sword Qi Great Wall should speak a little more heartfelt truth. If I weren't a businessman, I’d think every word deserves compensation.”

Chen Ping'an carefully put away the paintings.

He couldn’t guess why the old sword immortal wanted him to do this, why he had to come to the Respect Sword Pavilion to retrieve all the sword immortal paintings. 

He just followed orders.

The two exited the Respect Sword Pavilion together. As Chen Ping'an descended the steps, he suddenly said, “Uncle Yan, can I sit here for a moment?”

Yan Ming nodded, “I’ll wait for you at the gate; don’t linger too long.”

After Yan Ming left, the night grew deep and quiet, with only a single moon in the sky of the Great Harmony.

Alone, Chen Ping'an sat on the steps, lost in thought.

Loving someone means taking care of her for a lifetime, dedicating your life to her.

I leave first, and the last thing I see is her. She leaves first, and the last thing she sees is me.

Can I find a friend to drink the best wine without caring about the price? To enjoy even the worst wine without reservation?

Can I keep alive some of those who have passed? As long as I remember their words and actions, I’ll feel I haven’t done enough.

Growing up isn’t just the slow passage of time; it’s not simply moving from one place to another; often it happens in an instant.

Where the heart desires, the flying sword follows; both body and soul are free.

But how exactly does one become a sword cultivator?

For some reason, the ancient remnant sword intent of the Sword Qi Great Wall seemed to not favor Chen Ping'an at all.

He released a breath, stood up, and made up his mind. Even without a particularly suitable personal item, he would make do this time, gathering the five elements, and he should quickly return to the third realm of Qi Cultivation, the Liu Jin Realm.

However, this move was akin to forcing growth in a plant that should be nurtured over time; afterward, it would likely lead to a prolonged stagnation.

Quietly, he returned with Yan Ming to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Following the old sword immortal’s earlier instructions, Chen Ping'an handed over the item containing all the paintings to Yan Ming, while he himself headed back to the Ning residence.

On the city wall, Chen Qingdu retrieved the item from Chen Ping'an, but instead of opening it to take out all the sword immortal paintings, he used a forbidden technique to return it to Yan Ming, saying, “Give it back to that kid; tell him the item has a minor issue and can’t be opened for now. We’ll discuss it later.”

Yan Ming left the Sword Qi Great Wall with a forced smile.

Chen Qingdu and Zuo You stood and sat, respectively, gazing into the distance.

Suddenly, Chen Qingdu asked, “Is your little junior brother a fool? Didn’t he already have that last item related to the five elements? Why hasn’t he refined it?”

Zuo You replied, “That’s the work of the Fire Dragon True Person, and it pertains to the fundamental true qi of pure martial artists. Given Chen Ping'an’s current level, he can’t separate it at all. One misstep could lead to losing everything. Chen Qingdu, don’t go speaking flippantly here. Do you want the Qi Cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall to fall three realms, or the pure martial artists to fall another realm before you’re satisfied?”

Chen Qingdu laughed, “Is your senior brother a freeloader? Why aren’t you helping out?”

That statement hit home because Zuo You truly couldn’t do anything.

The sword skills were too high, and the sword qi too abundant, making it easy to clash with the buried treasure of the Fire Dragon True Person, turning Chen Ping'an’s entire personal realm into a battlefield.

To be honest, as long as Chen Qingdu didn’t act, no one else could do it within the Sword Qi Great Wall.

But who would dare ask Chen Qingdu to do anything?

Zuo You indeed dared, but he knew that as long as Chen Qingdu himself wasn’t willing, it would be useless.

After a moment of silence, Chen Qingdu asked, “Can Chen Ping'an endure hardship?”

Zuo You nodded, “He can.”

Chen Qingdu smiled and asked, “If you want me to help strip away that fire seed and refine it into the fifth personal item, it will require some cost, and Chen Ping'an will need to walk a path similar to the one that shapes true spiritual deities. Rest assured, it’s only similar, not exactly the same. Otherwise, forget about him; even the old scholar would fight me.”

Zuo You hesitated for the first time.

Zuo You was troubled.

Chen Qingdu clicked his tongue, “What a waste of being a senior brother. You’re not as straightforward as the little junior brother. Chen Ping'an has already agreed.”

Zuo You immediately stood, “I’ll guard the formation. As for what happens on the city wall, I won’t concern myself; I’ll make up for any missed strikes later.”

Chen Qingdu pressed a hand on Zuo You’s shoulder, smiling, “Zuo You, it seems you still don’t trust your little junior brother.”

Zuo You furrowed his brow and asked, “What’s the chance?”

Chen Qingdu held up a finger, “One chance out of one. Isn’t that enough?”

Zuo You was skeptical.

Chen Qingdu laughed, “With your sword skills so high, would I dare deceive you?”

Zuo You drew his sword from its sheath.

The entire Sword Qi Great Wall immediately sensed the anomaly.

Chen Qingdu, however, shifted slightly, grasping the sword’s edge, allowing the long sword to slide past his palm.

On the city wall, brilliant sparks erupted.

A battle erupted again. This time, Liu Xianyang wasn’t present and stayed by Chen Chunan’s side.

Once again, it was Chen Ping'an and Qi Shou acting as neighbors.

Qi Shou felt something was off; today, Chen Ping'an seemed a bit different.

Still clad in his robe from the clothing shop, he had a jade bamboo folding fan tucked at his waist. He turned to Qi Shou, smiling, “It’s only been a few days, but Qi brother’s demeanor surpasses the past!”

Qi Shou’s heart suddenly understood, but after another thought, he became uncertain. Heaven knows if this was yet another illusion, so Qi Shou retorted, “Keep your distance from me.”

Chen Ping'an opened his fan, gently fanning a cool breeze, carelessly summoning four flying swords, before shaking his head and sighing, “Qi brother, who gave you the confidence to look down on a third-realm great cultivator with a mere Essence Infant realm?”

Qi Shou ignored him, yet today he was particularly ruthless in striking down enemies.

Originally, Qi Shou wanted to ask why Zuo You had abruptly struck earlier, but now he didn’t want to say a word.

On the wall near the thatched hut, Zuo You silently inquired of the old sword immortal, “If the refinement of the personal item is successful and he endures that hardship, can he then nurture a personal flying sword? What would its quality be?”

Chen Qingdu looked confused, “Did I ever say that? Is there such a good deal in the world? A personal flying sword can’t be freely given.”

Zuo You turned his gaze toward the elderly figure at the entrance of the thatched hut.

Chen Qingdu composed himself and said, “I once borrowed a locust wood sword box. What’s borrowed must be returned, but I’ll let Chen Ping'an become a sword box first, or rather, a sword sheath. As for whether he can nurture a personal flying sword that is exceptionally gifted and naturally born, and what quality it will have, that depends on his own fortune.”

Zuo You took a deep breath and flew out from the city wall, once again departing the city with his sword, all alone, seeking out the great demon of the Ascended Realm.

In the secret chamber of the Ning residence.

A third-realm cultivator and a seventh-realm pure martial artist, Chen Ping'an, had only the shadow of his spirit travelling far into the Sword Qi Great Wall. His true body and external spirit remained in the Ning residence.

Because the old sword immortal said that the thoughts accumulated by that shadow were far too many and too mixed; no matter how he washed the sword, he couldn’t bring forth purity. Even if he did achieve a pure bright realm, that wouldn’t be Chen Ping'an anymore.

Chen Ping'an held his breath, focusing his mind, and the thoughts that circled in his heart repeatedly were words from a book—“The spirit soars to the extremes, the mind travels ten thousand fathoms, quietly contemplating, thoughts connecting across millennia.”

As his mind quieted, almost as if in deep sleep, only two thoughts from deep within his heart slowly drifted like a dragon swimming in the depths of a lake, yet they did not clash but rather coexisted peacefully.

Sword cultivators have freedom in body, mind, and life.

The power to kill is the greatest, surpassing the heavens!

Chen Ping'an suddenly opened his eyes and said in a deep voice, “I invite the old sword immortal to draw his sword.”

Within the secret chamber, a surge of sword light erupted.

In an instant, Chen Ping'an was left bloodied and battered, as if his golden body were made of paper, disintegrating in the blink of an eye; he was reduced to a bloody mess, and soon his limbs, organs, and even his eyeballs were completely dissolved in the sword light, leaving behind nothing but bones.

Eventually, even those bones ceased to exist.

In the endless night, a dazed young man stumbled down a road devoid of light, subconsciously moving forward.

As he walked, he came upon a hunchbacked child in straw sandals, moving slowly with a large basket on his back.

The child paused, looking up at the young man, sadness etched on his face, seemingly bewildered as to why he still struggled so much in adulthood.

Thus, the child’s heart ached, and he no longer wanted to move forward, crouching on the ground, leaning against the permanently unfilled basket of herbs, and began to sob.

The young man swayed, crouching down, staring blankly at the younger version of himself.

The two locked eyes.

The young man spoke three words.

“I’m sorry.”

Then the child wiped his tears and reached out his hand.

The young man took the child’s hand, stood up, and together they moved forward.

The young man remained bewildered, but from his heart, he began to share beautiful things he would encounter in the future, as if he completely forgot the hardships that could and could not be spoken of during growth, as if he couldn’t remember the unpleasant people and events, or the complexities of the world.

The child gradually smiled, looking up at his grown self with some longing.

Finally, the child paused, tightening his grip on the rope tied to the basket, his smile radiant, and pointed toward the road ahead for his grown self.

The young man looked up, and in the previously pitch-dark distance, a flickering light appeared, swaying uncertainly.

Suddenly.

Heaven and earth became clear, radiating brilliance.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 734: Sword Cultivator

On the city wall, Qi Shou couldn't help but turn his head. Chen Ping'an was pulling out stacks of yellow paper talismans, feeling as if a new shop was opening. But who would buy these low-grade talismans? Were they meant for the beasts of the wilderness?

There were truly many talismans, with identical ones stacked one on top of the other. Thus, on over a dozen small hills, tall and short, there were over a thousand talismans, all accumulated somehow.

The paper was of very ordinary quality and was surely not worth much. The Sword Qi Great Wall didn’t sell such items, which clearly indicated that these were the shabby goods Chen Ping'an had brought from the Haoran world. Even the basic yellow talisman paper for Qi practitioners of the lower realms didn’t count; these were merely yellow paper talismans sold everywhere in the market. If he added a peach wood sword to the mix, they would be the typical gear of con artists wandering the foothills.

As Chen Ping'an set up his display, he turned to Qi Shou.

Qi Shou immediately felt something was off.

Chen Ping'an's gaze was as sincere as a father looking at his own son. He smiled and said, “Brother Qi, don’t miss out as you pass by. I, Chen, the good person from the Package Zhai, am entirely different from that tavern’s second shopkeeper. Don’t be fooled by the small size of my Package Zhai; I have traveled through the realms of the Bottle Continent, the Cedar Leaf Continent, and the Northern Blades Continent for many years, especially in the realm of talismans, which is renowned for its affordability and high quality. I’ve received countless gold plaques from customers who bought my talismans, all of them overflowing with gratitude and wanting to thank me—so many I can hardly stop them. Brother Qi, what do you think? We fight side by side, not just friends but better than friends. I can offer discounts; if you don’t have any divine money on you, that’s fine too—I’m open to credit, no interest. I’m very easy to negotiate with.”

Qi Shou pretended not to hear.

But he couldn’t escape Chen Ping'an’s incessant chatter. Chen Ping'an went on to explain the intricacies of over ten types of talismans, claiming that the Heaven Department's Thunder Talisman, though it stemmed from a side branch of thunder techniques, was extremely lethal. He explained how the Great River Flow Talisman was perfect for the blood-soaked battlefields and how the Soil Capture Talisman could raise mountains from the ground to impede the advance of the demon army, with the talisman summoning mountains being incredibly mystical.

Qi Shou was driven to distraction by the chatter and finally coldly replied, “Though I am but a minor Nascent Soul sword cultivator, not as impressive as the third realm master shopkeeper, I am still a sword cultivator. What use do I have for your talismans? To burn yellow paper at graves? The Sword Qi Great Wall has no such custom.”

Chen Ping'an picked up a stack of talismans, his patience unwavering, a smile still on his face as he explained to “Brother Qi,” “This is a great opportunity I obtained through countless jars of exquisite celestial wine. One drunken great sword immortal accidentally revealed a heavenly secret and privately taught me this ‘Pass Talisman.’ Pass means that it can let living people through, and on the battlefield, it can certainly send enemies to the underworld. Brother Qi, are you really not tempted? The great battle has not yet truly heated up; relying solely on flying swords to slaughter beasts has lost some of its excitement. It’s just like drinking at my tavern—no matter how good the wine is, no matter how it surpasses the Sword Qi Great Wall, it ultimately needs side dishes like pickles and noodles to truly be delightful.”

Chen Ping'an switched hands and picked up another large stack of talismans, “This talisman is even more remarkable; it’s a treasured skill of the great sword immortal, the ‘Sword Qi Bridge Crossing Talisman.’ Brother Qi, your realm may not be high for now, but I believe your discerning eye is sharp. Look at how intricate it is; each seemingly small talisman is practically a true talisman array. I won’t say much more; just the celestial cinnabar needed to draw these talismans consumes so much! How can you dismiss my talismans just because the paper isn’t top-notch? Brother Qi, I didn’t expect you to be such a superficial person. I’m quite disappointed. You killed a minor deity on the battlefield, and with the same kind of back-and-forth combat, you’ve at least outdone that minor deity. With your talent, you could easily be the eldest brother among the disciples of Mount Tuo Yue…”

Qi Shou shouted angrily, “Chen Ping'an, will you ever be done?! During the war, I advise you to focus on killing enemies with your sword! Even if you dare to risk your life, don’t drag others down with you!”

Chen Ping'an set down the two stacks of talismans and gently tapped his heart with his folded fan. Looking towards the southern battlefield, he smiled, “Since Brother Qi currently has no intention to buy, that’s fine. In this world of trade, fate is the first consideration. I’ll just observe how you, a heroic figure, take down the enemy. Some people over in the city have a few comments about your methods, saying they’re too ruthless. But to me, it’s great! That bit of arrogance from your noble family background, that pride as a genius sword cultivator, that unwillingness to allow peers to surpass you—those are minor flaws. But once you step onto the battlefield, you transform into a true hero. Being able to endure a Chen Ping'an you want to kill but can’t, and even suppressing some displeasure to help me fight and defend the battlefield, this sword cultivator Qi Shou truly embodies the demeanor of a top sword immortal…”

Qi Shou took a deep breath, “Is it that as long as I don’t buy your worthless talismans, you will keep going on and on?”

Chen Ping'an opened his fan and smiled, “No need to say more, Brother Qi, just focus on wielding your sword gracefully.”

Qi Shou withdrew his gaze and continued to navigate his flying sword, slaying the demons.

Compared to the first battle, the proportion of demon cultivators in human form among the attacking army was noticeably higher this time. No longer were they merely unrefined beasts that the sword cultivators on the walls could easily crush and wouldn’t even count towards military achievements. In that opening battle, those demons weren’t really considered proper cultivators; they were primarily driven forward, only useful for creating mountains of corpses to fill the chasms that the sword immortals had opened, blood and flesh staining the ground and affecting the natural elements.

In truth, Qi Shou looked down on several types of talismans belonging to the five elemental categories, but he was indeed somewhat interested in the Pass Talisman and the Bridge Crossing Talisman, especially the latter, because there were threads of sword qi flowing through the talisman paper, making it genuine. The essence of sword intent within the talisman was not much but was exquisite, and Chen Ping'an claimed it was taught to him privately by a great sword immortal, which made Qi Shou believe a bit of it.

However, Qi Shou found it easy to defend the battlefield himself and had no intention of engaging in business with Chen Ping'an. No matter how extravagant the claims, the reputation of the second shopkeeper selling wine at the Sword Qi Great Wall was already widespread, and even those in other taverns might struggle to make a profit. Chen Ping'an himself surely knew that.

The sword cultivator replacing Xie Songhua and Liu Xianyong on the battlefield was an old Nascent Soul who fell silent upon arriving at this wall—Cheng Quan, who had dropped back to the Nascent Soul realm from the upper five realms. He preferred to sit far apart from the sword immortal Zhao Ge, with whom he had argued for half a lifetime. They were seated on opposite sides of the city wall, and if they had a disagreement, they would hurl insults at each other. In the past, Cheng Quan spoke a lot when confronting Zhao Ge, but now, without Zhao Ge, he seemed to have no opponent and remained silent.

In fact, in the southern part of the city, there was a private residence left behind by a sword immortal, obtained through military merit by Cheng Quan's ancestor and later recorded under Cheng Quan's name. Because Cheng Quan's lineage had now completely perished except for him, it was a fate similar to that of the female sword immortal Zhou Cheng.

Cheng Quan’s sword strikes were exceptionally swift. His flying sword, “Water Mountain,” created peaks that seemed carved from jade in the sky above the battlefield, smashing the demons into pulp. Should any demon cultivator manage to escape death or dodge, he would toss down more peaks. Each peak, once shattered by a formidable demon cultivator using a magical treasure, would transform into a lake of blue water, instantly freezing the battlefield upon landing, causing the demons to look up and see more mountains crashing down upon them.

So compared to the actions of the two neighbors, with Chen Ping'an unleashing four flying swords and Qi Shou slaughtering demons, the battlefield on Cheng Quan's side was exceptionally clean and clear.

What further opened Chen Ping'an’s eyes was the sight of many relatively weak demon souls being effortlessly pulled into the lakes, ultimately shattering along with the freezing waters.

Actually, Cheng Quan also had a seemingly useless personal flying sword, “Tuo Bei,” but he also possessed a significant item, name unknown, that functioned like a bonsai, placing stones as mountains and water as rivers.

Years ago, Cheng Quan’s mentor, one of the sword immortals who led hunts in the wilderness, would first refine rivers and peaks and then bring them back to the Sword Qi Great Wall for his disciple Cheng Quan to refine. After the latter summoned the small mountains and rivers from the bonsai, combined with the divine ability of his personal flying sword “Tuo Bei,” extraordinary phenomena would occur on the battlefield, with surging rivers and rising mountains, further amplified by the intent of the Tuo Bei sword.

This was why, after the Thirteen Struggles, Cheng Quan was closely pursued by a great demon and was ambushed, leading to his fall in realm. Though he might seem inconspicuous among sword immortals, on the battlefield, facing a comparable opponent like Wu Chengpei, who wielded a flying sword called “Ganlin,” he would inflict significant casualties on the attacking army from the wilderness.

As Chen Ping'an turned to look, Cheng Quan calmly said, “Shut your mouth. I have no money to be swindled.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Alright then.”

Qi Shou was left in disbelief. What a guy! Why was it that while both were Nascent Soul sword cultivators, Chen Ping'an became so amiable upon reaching Cheng Quan’s side?

Not only that, Qi Shou noticed that the Chen Ping'an who had just been rebuffed didn’t hold a grudge but instead tossed a jug of wine worth five snowflake coins over to the old man from a distance.

Cheng Quan opened the seal, sniffed it, and disdainfully said, “Too bland; what kind of wine is this? Women like Zhao Ge would enjoy it.”

Despite saying that, he still drank.

Unexpectedly, Chen Ping'an tossed over a jug of strong liquor freshly sold from the tavern. Cheng Quan took a sniff and nodded, “Now that’s real wine! No wonder the tavern is doing well. If you opened a tavern on the city wall, I would buy from you.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “No credit.”

Cheng Quan shot a sideways glance at the young man and asked, “I heard you got knocked down by a little girl’s punch at the Ning residence?”

Chen Ping'an lightly tapped his palm with his folding fan and said, “To be honest with you, Senior Cheng, displaying strength to deceive the enemy is my specialty. No matter who I spar with, the odds of me winning are quite high. Like this brother Qi here beside me.”

During the second battle, with the same flying swords, Chen Ping'an was even more relaxed and comfortable, his flying swords moving faster.

When it came to maneuvering flying swords, it was indeed his forte. He didn’t have to be bound by various principles, making his intent much purer. Principles are good, but too many can weigh one down, causing the flying swords to slow down naturally. A slight difference can mean a world of difference.

Cheng Quan found the young man’s words far more interesting than those of Zhao Ge.

Thus, the old Nascent Soul directly moved his position to sit next to Chen Ping'an and asked, “I’ve heard that the Haoran world has many wondrous mountains and rivers, capable of captivating the eye and heart?”

Chen Ping'an didn’t even turn to speak but gazed ahead, smiling, “It’s just that. Once you’ve seen enough, especially when you have to tread through them, you’ll grow tired. Everywhere you look is blocked, making it hard to feel free like a bird soaring over Zhongnan. In my hometown, cultivators who dwell in the mountains for long will become so still that they yearn to move, rolling down into the mundane world, only to return to the mountains, which isn’t particularly meaningful.”

Cheng Quan regretted moving to sit next to him; this guy had just been lively, but now he was rambling on, boring and uninteresting.

Chen Ping'an took out a book of the Bi Sword Immortal’s seals from his robes, turned with a smile, and handed it to Cheng Quan, “Senior Cheng, take a look and see if there’s any seal you’re interested in. Business has been so good that almost all of them have been sold, but if you ask nicely, I can carve more and even give a discount. Even if you don’t like them, you can just sell them again for a jug or two of wine—what’s there not to like?”

Cheng Quan opened the seal book, casually flipping through a page, and exclaimed, “Beyond the business aspect, whoever picks a seal, on the surface seems to be a matter of fate, but in reality, it represents a certain attachment. Giving it to you for free not only earns a profit but also allows one to read into a person’s heart. Second shopkeeper, what a good business!”

“Reading hearts, is it better to knock or to push? I think neither is good,” Chen Ping'an said, shaking his fan with a look of grievance, “Senior Cheng, don’t take advantage of your profound sword skills, which allow you to stand out among many sword immortals, to bully a junior like me. But at this moment, while you drink, read, and strike with your sword, your sword qi flipping through the pages, killing demons while enjoying your wine, you truly embody the elegance of a cultured person.”

Though Cheng Quan casually flipped through the seal book, when it came to striking with his sword, he was by no means careless. Chen Ping'an, now back in the role of the Package Zhai, was more agile than ever in his sword strikes.

Cheng Quan paused at the edge of a seal, wanting to turn the page, but out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the shameless little brat staring right at him. The latter smiled knowingly, as if to say, “I understand, you needn’t feel embarrassed.” Cheng Quan didn’t mind anymore, reaching out to touch those words, especially the “beautiful person” at the end, which made the old sword cultivator sigh.

“Old clothes and a broken hat, old roads through green mountains and rivers, morning dew and evening glow, the stars and rivers, lights and flowers for the beautiful person.”

He, Cheng Quan, and Zhao Ge had argued for a lifetime, never knowing whom she truly liked. She only said that whoever ascended to the realm of immortals first, she would like. At that time, Cheng Quan had a higher realm and better talent, so he claimed she would definitely like him. Zhao Ge insisted that her intentions were noble, hoping to encourage Cheng Quan’s determination.

Each had their reasoning, leading to countless arguments. Once, there was a female sword immortal named Song Yun Cai from the Sword Qi Great Wall, whose elegance was unparalleled. She, Cheng Quan, and Zhao Ge all came from the same crooked alley. During the years when they were all Nascent Soul sword cultivators fighting side by side, that alley, which produced three sword immortals, became so famous that even the Hanging Mountain and the distant Yu Long Sect and Nan Po Sha Continent had heard of it.

Cheng Quan tossed the Bi Sword Immortal’s seal book back to Chen Ping'an and casually said, “Once you become a sword cultivator, don’t be too worldly.”

Chen Ping'an put away the seal book. He hadn’t made any sales at the Package Zhai today, nor did he want to give away two jugs of celestial wine, but since Cheng Quan mentioned becoming a sword cultivator, as the saying goes, “Good things come in threes.” He smiled, “I’ll take your good words, and then I’ll become a sword cultivator.”

Both fell silent and struck with their swords.

Qi Shou couldn’t help but envy that second shopkeeper—he could talk to anyone.

An hour later, Cheng Quan suddenly said, “In my opinion, aside from any fist techniques or magical treasures, you have quite a bit of quick wit; that’s your most reliable skill. If I were to let you carve that last seal, keeping the edge unchanged but changing the inscription, what would you carve? To me, the Bi Sword Immortal’s seals combined with those fan inscriptions are a jumble of words. Anyone who has read a few books can copy them; at most, it’s just a little repurposing. It doesn’t count as true skill. The disciples of the Sage of Literature have tons of knowledge; it shouldn’t be limited to just this.”

This time it was Cheng Quan’s turn to be surprised; the second shopkeeper directly took out a clean seal and said, “I’ll trouble Senior Cheng to keep an eye on my battlefield. Of course, the military merits still count as mine.”

Having Cheng Quan help to strike against the enemies was quite steady.

Chen Ping'an was boldly taking a break, recalling four flying swords, three of which he placed into the sword-rearing gourd to recuperate. He only used the fifteen flying swords as carving knives. Not only did he change the inscriptions, but he also altered the edges of the seals.

After handing it back to Cheng Quan, the latter held it in his palm, lifted it up, and with a poker face, nodded, “It’s passable.”

The seemingly appealing yet not genuinely cherished new seal was tucked into Cheng Quan's sleeve.

Old friends are also beautiful people, generous and full of strange principles.

The youthful heart has a peak, suddenly stolen away by clouds.

Inscription: “Accidental.”

Chen Ping'an wasn’t in a hurry to strike again; he let Cheng Quan help clear the battlefield, muttering to himself, “Having a great beauty in heart, I’m not afraid of being seen.”

With the jade bamboo fan gifted by his student Cui Dongshan, he fanned himself and also helped the old senior cool off, grinning, “For the seal crafted just for you, the material is top-notch, and every character is carved with care. The original price isn’t high; one Grain Rain coin, plus since Senior is a sword immortal, there’s an 80% discount. Now, helping a junior kill demons, it’s only five Shallow Summer coins!”

Chen Ping'an lowered his voice and said, “If it were me, I wouldn’t even dream of discounts; one Grain Rain coin is just one.”

Cheng Quan didn’t respond to the young man; the old sword cultivator’s expression was dazed, and slowly a smile appeared on his weathered face as he murmured, “She was the most beautiful woman in the Sword Qi Great Wall back then, truly lovely.”

At this point, Cheng Quan earnestly said to Chen Ping'an, “She was even more dazzling than your Ning Yao.”

Unexpectedly, the scholar turned his face faster than he could turn a page.

Chen Ping'an exploded, “You’re talking nonsense!”

Cheng Quan’s mood brightened instead. This familiar scene didn’t faze him at all; he just drank the wine and took the seal, feeling it was inappropriate to curse back, and laughed, “Why are you cursing?”

Chen Ping'an asked, “If you suppressed your realm to that of a third-realm cultivator, do you think I would curse you?”

Cheng Quan smiled and reminded, “Second shopkeeper, if you keep this up, I won’t be polite.”

Qi Shou felt somewhat helpless.

The old and young were arguing as if two hundred people were about to start a brawl.

Fortunately, it didn’t delay their sword strikes against the enemies.

This was normal; one was an experienced old sword cultivator while the other was a meticulous second shopkeeper.

The only thing Qi Shou hadn’t expected was that the two sides could really go at it.

It seemed that Chen Ping'an had the upper hand, as some of his insults were delivered in his hometown dialect or the refined language of another continent. Cheng Quan didn’t understand and had to guess what the other was saying. At times, Chen Ping'an would look at him with a sympathetic gaze, mixing his insults and praises in different dialects and occasionally restating them in the language of the Sword Qi Great Wall. For Cheng Quan to retort, he had to figure out the truth of those words, putting him in a difficult position. His skills honed from years of bickering with Zhao Ge had inevitably lost some edge.

It was quite lively.

When Fan Dache came to deliver wine to Chen Ping'an, his scalp tingled.

Fan Dache only dared to come once; after that, he sent Dong Huafu, who had temporarily withdrawn from the battlefield, to deliver the wine. Dong Huafu enjoyed the lively atmosphere, sitting nearby and listening intently, finding that he learned quite a bit from the excitement. Moreover, Dong Huafu’s ability to fan the flames was a unique talent that no one could replicate.

After a while, the two armies faced off without a ceasefire; Cheng Quan and Chen Ping'an welcomed another respite.

In fact, Qi Shou was the one who suffered the most.

Chen Ping'an often brought him up, calling him “my brother Qi” and mentioning how young he was, a thirty-something lad who was already a Nascent Soul sword cultivator. “If you, Senior Cheng, had any self-respect, you’d stay as far away from Qi Shou as possible. You, Senior Cheng, your realm is low, but I’ve heard you only have two flying swords. How many does Brother Qi have? The key is that every single one of Brother Qi’s flying swords is of an exceptionally high rank, something that comes around once in a millennium. How can you possibly compare?”

With Cheng Quan’s temper, once he got riled up, he wouldn’t just curse Qi Shou; he’d go after his ancestors too.

At this moment, Cheng Quan laughed and said, “Little brother Chen, after sparring with you, I’ll head back to argue with that Zhao Ge woman for sure.”

Chen Ping'an shook his fan and smiled, “Let me say something fair: I can curse both of you by myself.”

Cheng Quan glared, “You give a little color and expect me to open a dye shop, huh? Want to spar again?!”

Chen Ping'an appeared silent but was quietly communicating with Cheng Quan.

Cheng Quan seemed to weigh the pros and cons before nodding, addressing Qi Shou, “That little brat with eyes on his forehead, young Qi, I see your extraordinary roots. How about I send you an opportunity?”

Qi Shou feigned ignorance.

Cheng Quan pulled out two stacks of talismans and handed them to Qi Shou.

A moment later, Cheng Quan returned, not to Chen Ping'an’s side but to the area once occupied by the female sword immortal Xie Songhua and the scholar Liu Xianyong.

Qi Shou examined the two talismans, the Pass Talisman and the Bridge Crossing Talisman, scrutinizing them. Both types were of higher quality than he had imagined, and drawn on such crude paper, it truly felt like a waste. After hesitating for a moment, he finally communicated with Chen Ping'an in his heart, “What exactly are you scheming?”

Cheng Quan remarked that Qi Shou's personal flying sword, the Jump Pearl, had not yet been refined to perfection and, while abundant in quantity, still lacked some potency. He then shared some insights on swordsmanship that Qi Shou had to consider seriously—even if they weren’t entirely suited for his swordplay, for a Nascent Soul cultivator who could easily fall into a stagnant state, even a tiny bit of Dao insight could not be underestimated.

In addition, Cheng Quan suggested that Qi Shou might as well do business with Chen Ping'an, as it wouldn’t be a loss. If it were, he could ask Zhao Ge for compensation.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Helping others is helping oneself.”

He added, “As for whether to give the wilderness a little surprise, that’s up to you. I’ve never done any business that forces things; it’s all about mutual consent, making money happily and spending joyfully.”

Qi Shou fell into thought.

Earlier, Cheng Quan's proposal was simple yet complex. Simple, because that Jump Pearl flying sword, which was expected to reach the status of a celestial weapon, could transform into hundreds of true swords without losing sword intent. Since the quantity was sufficient, it could be supplemented with something extra, like adding another divine ability to the personal flying sword.

Complex, however, was the so-called “supplementing,” which was an incredibly intricate process requiring talismans to assist every single flying sword. Each flying sword must link with each other, forming a talisman array, and ultimately all Jump Pearl flying swords would be transformed into a large talisman array.

Moreover, Qi Shou harbored hidden worries, fearing that Chen Ping'an, during this process, would become too familiar with his personal flying sword, the Jump Pearl.

After all, this flying sword was far more crucial to Qi Shou than his ancestral half-celestial weapon, the “High Candle.”

Whether in life-or-death battles or slaying enemies on the battlefield, once Qi Shou could wield a thousand true Jump Pearl flying swords, what kind of scene would that be?

And what kind of feeling would it evoke in those opposing him?

As Qi Shou himself said, once he left the city wall, he and Chen Ping'an would be enemies.

Chen Ping'an suddenly chuckled, “Have you ever considered that with the strength of the Qi family, as long as you thought of this, once your Jump Pearl’s rank reaches the peak, if you learn this talisman technique from me, all you have to do is follow the template and spend some money, wouldn’t you gain an unexpected harvest? Is it more of a loss for me to become familiar with the unique divine ability of the Jump Pearl or for you to gain an extra layer of genuine combat strength? Brother Qi, you decide for yourself.”

Qi Shou looked down at the two stacks of talismans that had yet to be returned, furrowing his brow. “After breaking through, I can now wield nearly seven hundred Jump Pearl flying swords. Can your yellow paper talismans really form an array? How do you calculate the price of each talisman? If they turn out to be useless, when facing a demon cultivator of the upper five realms, won’t they be easily crushed? How do you plan to handle that? The most critical point is, will you really impart all the intricacies of the talisman array to me? Let’s say I’m a purely sword cultivator; with the ongoing battles, how can I find time to learn those talismans? If you only drew a big pie, what good would it do if I paid but couldn’t enjoy it?”

Chen Ping'an clicked his tongue, “Brother Qi, you’re not being generous enough. Partnering with me in business won’t lead to losses; it will only be a matter of how much you gain! I’m not just saying this randomly; I have done things that you can all see as facts.”

Finally, Chen Ping'an turned his head, folding his fan, his expression regretful as he shook his head and sighed, “Brother Qi, do you really see me as a life-and-death enemy outside the battlefield, deserving of the Sword Immortal Dao that you treat as a trifle?”

With a flick of his fan, he summoned the two stacks of talismans back to his side and smiled, “If the trade doesn’t go through, we remain righteous. Allow me to offer you a piece of sage advice, ‘A gentleman respects what is within himself and does not envy what is in the heavens; thus, he progresses each day.’”

Cheng Quan laughed in his heart, “Is the business already in the red?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “That’s human nature; if it were me, I wouldn’t agree easily either.”

Cheng Quan nodded, “The talisman array is indeed a worthless endeavor; it’s good that Qi Shou isn’t fooled by you.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “But I can’t say that. My talisman technique is quite hard-won. Once it’s completed, its power is indeed considerable…”

Cheng Quan paused, “Wait a moment, do you mean to say that whether it succeeds or fails, you can’t guarantee it?!”

Chen Ping'an answered, “Can I or Qi Shou guarantee that it will be completed immediately? Moreover, drawing talismans is something that requires genius and skill; it’s only natural. What’s wrong with wasting a few hundred talismans? Brother Qi has money; why fear such losses? If I had a bit less conscience, I would’ve pulled out stacks of yellow talisman paper instead; that would truly be something divine beings would feel pained over.”

Cheng Quan laughed heartily, “Little brother Chen, helping others, practicing your talisman drawing, and still making a profit; what a great scheme!”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Aren’t you complaining about how fat the pig is before slaughtering it?”

Cheng Quan was immensely entertained.

However, Chen Ping'an finally added, “But looking at this grandest war in the world, I sincerely look forward to seeing Qi Shou unleash a thousand swords. Even if you’re not yet a sword cultivator, just imagining that scene makes my heart long for it.”

“A gentleman respects what is within himself and does not envy what is in the heavens; thus, he progresses each day.” 

This sage teaching, this good principle, actually came from the writings of Chen Ping'an's teacher. If one could envy what others possess while also respecting what is within oneself, wouldn’t that be better?

This small doubt, this trivial insight from reading, must be shared with his teacher in the future.

Qi Shou asked, “How much for each yellow paper talisman?”

Chen Ping'an tucked the fan into his waist, bent forward, and scampered over to Qi Shou, muttering, “I’ll trouble you, Brother Qi, to help me kill some enemies for a moment, and I’ll explain it to you in detail. In any case, I can guarantee that the more talismans you buy, the greater the discount! Our brotherly bond, so clear, is worth a fortune!”

Then at Qi Shou’s side, Chen Ping'an turned and shouted, “Senior Cheng, Brother Qi needs a little support here; show a bit of your senior demeanor. In no time, Brother Qi will return to the wall!”

Chen Ping'an led Qi Shou away from the city wall, squatting together at the base of the wall, piling the yellow paper talismans by his feet. He gathered his voice into a line, whispering, “Different talismans have different prices. Brother Qi isn’t the kind of person who would nitpick over details, so I’ll directly offer a fair packaged price: a thousand talismans, not one less, for only three Grain Rain coins.”

Qi Shou was about to get up and leave.

A thousand yellow paper talismans—how many silver coins could that buy in the Haoran world? At most, a few dozen.

Even if the celestial cinnabar used for drawing talismans consumed quite a bit, considering Chen Ping'an’s stingy character, being able to draw over a thousand of them would hardly yield high quality, and how many snowflake coins could it cost? At most, a few Shallow Summer coins.

Chen Ping'an didn’t stop him, just spoke to himself, “My talisman array is related to the Three Mountains and Nine Lords. Of course, it’s not just a direct copy. To be honest, with my current level, I can’t draw it up, but the fundamental of the talisman array truly has great significance, and it’s closely related. Besides that, I will definitely put forth my entire skill in drawing talismans, not holding back at all. If I can save you even one talisman, I will. Of course, it must be said beforehand; this is an ancient talisman array that has been lost for a long time, not something simple to draw. There will be some losses, so Brother Qi, prepare yourself mentally. As for how to attach sword intent to the sword body with the talismans, that is another extraordinary unique skill.”

Qi Shou squinted and smiled, “How will these thousand drawn talismans assist my flying sword? Did you plan this deal with me from the start, so each talisman is tailored for this purpose? And that even we, as neighbors, could have guessed early on?”

“Look at you, Brother Qi, using a gentleman’s heart to gauge a saint’s belly. You’ve wronged me,” Chen Ping'an said, feeling a bit embarrassed. He picked up a stack of talisman paper, rubbing his fingers over each, revealing that aside from the first and last few, the rest were blank. Chen Ping'an helplessly said, “Drawing talismans is an extremely meticulous task. Last time, when I fought with Li Zhen, I lost far too many valuable talismans. I was heavily injured, falling three realms. Brother Qi, can you imagine how painful that was? Since then, I have been stretched thin, needing to practice both my fist techniques and recover my realm. I haven’t had the chance to draw these talismans. So I forgot to mention, the labor costs for drawing the talismans and the loss of many achievements in slaying demons…”

Qi Shou coldly chuckled, “Cheng Quan helped you slay demons; you won’t lose any military merit.”

Chen Ping'an responded with a “Oh,” “In that case, let’s just discuss the labor costs for drawing the talismans. In the Haoran world, we have this custom of a ‘pen fee,’ so Brother Qi, just a token amount will do—two or three Shallow Summer coins, a mere drizzle.”

Qi Shou replied, “The Sword Qi Great Wall has no such custom.”

Chen Ping'an said, “Then three Grain Rain coins really can’t be discounted any further.”

Qi Shou said, “Are you trying to milk me dry?”

“Brother Qi, I won’t allow you to belittle yourself like this, claiming you’re getting swindled,” Chen Ping'an said, laughing heartily.

After saying this, Chen Ping'an let out a rare, hearty laugh, patting Qi Shou on the shoulder. “I’m reminded of an old friend who would still think fondly of our future reunions; Brother Qi is bound to be like him, lucky enough to live until the end.”

Qi Shou shrugged off Chen Ping'an’s hand and frowned.

Chen Ping'an raised his head and looked at Qi Shou, smiling, “It seems I haven’t misjudged you, Brother Qi; there’s no need to divide life and death on the battlefield.”

Qi Shou asked, “What do you mean?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “You’ll have to guess.”

Qi Shou chuckled, “Aren’t you afraid I’m laying a trap for you? Don’t forget, I have many Jump Pearl flying swords; you still don’t know how many I actually possess. Can you keep your eyes on every detail of my battlefield?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I’m quite free; I’m good at this.”

Qi Shou recalled something.

He had heard from the family elders that all sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall had recently received a strange order, with each sword immortal instructed to hold back their strength at different stages.

This was definitely not something the head sword immortal would willingly do.

Willing to betray, daring to defect, that was easy enough.

As long as one hid deep enough, it could be considered a skill. But if one didn’t hide well and the head sword immortal saw through it, that would surely result in death.

So it must have been someone from outside who suggested it.

In addition, many young sword cultivators had received a peculiar talisman from the clothing workshop that could conceal their forms.

In the past, while it wasn’t that no one from the Sword Qi Great Wall could draw such talismans, no sword cultivator had ever thought it necessary.

Some sword cultivators might have wanted to do so, but they could only bury that idea deep within, suspected of cowardice.

So there were indeed outsiders who could persuade the old sword immortals to forcibly make young sword cultivators post this talisman.

Moreover, on the city wall, aside from the peak ten and certain key positions that couldn’t be moved, many sword immortals began to quietly rotate their guard positions.

Qi Shou asked, “Did you say something to the head sword immortal?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Now it’s not only the beasts of the wilderness who want me dead; many sword immortals who need to find a way out also want me dead.”

Qi Shou looked at him strangely, “You’re really not afraid of death? What’s your aim?”

Chen Ping'an lightly tapped his shoulder with the folding fan, “When I want to die, you wouldn’t even conceive of my methods. When I want to live, you’ll find it even harder to imagine.”

Qi Shou simply sat down on the ground, leaning against the wall, and stretched out his hand, “Bring me a jug of wine.”

Chen Ping'an sat beside him, tossing over a jug of bamboo sea cave wine, while he took down the gourd that temporarily housed his four flying swords.

Rumor had it that the spring banners from the Hanging Mountain were about to mature and drop, each gourd being of very high quality, but their price was too steep and long since had a price but no market.

Qi Shou said to Cheng Quan, “Senior Cheng, wait a moment; let me have a bit more wine.”

Chen Ping'an immediately shouted, “All the military merits from my brother Qi’s drinking skills count towards me!”

Qi Shou felt a bit helpless; he was speaking to Cheng Quan with a sincere heart.

While drinking, Qi Shou asked, “What about the old accounts between you and me?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “The Qi family’s past bullying is all laid bare; I can actually accept it. Being strong, direct, and straightforward is another way to treat people with sincerity. This principle, whether I like it or not, I just have to endure it, as it’s too simple, too worry-free, and even allows for right and wrong to cover each other, compensating in turn. If when it comes time for me to strike with fists or swords, the previous matters remain unchanged, that’s simple—one for one, I’ll return it all to you. Qi Shou, many real difficulties are not because I look down on you; it’s in the Haoran world that it becomes heart-wrenching, filled with troubles. If you ever get the chance to visit there, remember to tread lightly.”

Qi Shou shook his head, “I’m not particularly interested in the Haoran world; I’d rather take a trip deep into the wilderness to learn from the strongest sword cultivators.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Wielding a sword to travel the land, leaving home for thousands of miles, without any attachments—now that’s truly a sword immortal.”

Chen Ping'an put away the sword-rearing gourd, “Let’s get to work and make some money.”

Qi Shou summoned seven hundred and thirty-two Jump Pearl flying swords, clustering them by the wall, ready to return to the wall.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an said softly, “If all the key talismans were replaced with yellow talismans or even better paper, combining the talisman array with the sword array would be incredible. Once Brother Qi unleashes his swords from the city wall, wouldn’t the power surpass even the heavens?”

Qi Shou stopped in his tracks, curious, “How much would that cost?”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, looking north, and smiled, “I’m in a good mood; I’ll only charge you the same divine money.”

As Qi Shou turned around, he heard Chen Ping'an say, “Just five coins.”

Qi Shou turned his head.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Brother Qi, after our heartfelt exchange, isn’t it worth at least two Grain Rain coins?”

Qi Shou shook his head sternly, “Not worth it.”

Chen Ping'an sighed in resignation, “Brother Qi, you always look down on yourself; that’s not good.”

Qi Shou leaped up to the city wall, thanking Senior Cheng.

---

Inside the secret chamber of the Ning residence.

Chen Ping'an opened his eyes, astonished to find his body intact and unharmed.

Confused, Chen Ping'an stumbled out of the secret chamber and made his way to the training ground. The journey was eerily silent.

He didn’t see Granny Bai, walking all the way to the Dragon Slaying Cliff, as if in this vast universe, he was the only one.

Looking up, someone appeared as if parting the heavens, arriving at the training ground.

Chen Ping'an’s heart stirred; he felt inexplicably restless, in a place where he had never intentionally opened a qi abode, it stirred violently, but this strange sensation quickly faded.

The one who came to the Ning residence was the head sword immortal, merely projecting his soul out of his body.

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists, saying, “Thank you, head sword immortal, for wielding your sword, and again for shielding the heavens and earth.”

Chen Qingdu smiled, “Wielding the sword is true, but where does the shielding the heavens and earth come from?”

Chen Ping'an was even more puzzled.

Chen Qingdu said, “Over tens of thousands of years, countless sword cultivators have had their personal flying swords but remain unaware; that’s truly rare.”

Chen Qingdu chuckled, looking around and nodding, “Being in this situation, what a caged bird.”

Chen Ping'an suddenly understood.

His heart felt light and satisfied.

Chen Qingdu asked, “Capturing your enemy in the heavens and earth, is that enough? What about the second personal flying sword?”

In an instant, the space between heaven and earth was filled with flying swords, layers upon layers, densely packed, countless.

In my world, all are caged birds.

If I’m not a sword cultivator, who is?!

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 735: Betrayal

Chen Qingdu glanced at Chen Pingan.

Chen Pingan immediately sheathed the unnamed flying sword, and with a thought, all the flying swords vanished without a trace of sword light, hidden within the crucial Qi chamber, finally coalescing into a single sword.

This kind of flying sword that almost entirely disregarded the flow of time was, in fact, quite unreasonable. Its existence was thanks to this life-bound sword being placed within the small realm created by another life-bound sword. The overlapping powers of the two allowed for such an elusive effect.

The life-bound flying sword refined by a Qi practitioner, even if it had undergone great refinement, still belonged to the category of external objects. In contrast, a sword cultivator's own life-bound flying sword was a matter of life and death, possessing various unimaginable powers. 

The Song Needle Thunder was a replica from the Sword of Hatred Mountain, requiring no further explanation; it was more of a complement to talismans, utilized purely by martial artist Chen Pingan for fleeing or fighting for his life.

The first and fifteenth are genuine relics of ancient sword immortals. However, even after being greatly refined by Chen Pingan, it still couldn't unleash its powers or the subtleties of swordplay, remaining stuck at the levels of speed, resilience, and sharpness—this could be considered a waste of talent. After exhausting all his efforts, Chen Pingan had not succumbed to self-pity over the years.

As Chen Pingan retracted the mysterious powers of the other life-bound flying sword, the small realm enveloping both him and the Elder Sword Immortal Chen Qingdu dissipated.

Bai Lianshuang stood at a distance in the corridor, and upon confirming her suspicions, she turned away and wiped the corners of her eyes with the back of her hand.

In truth, when Chen Pingan had earlier left the secret chamber of Ningfu in a daze, the old woman had already sensed something unusual. At that time, Chen Pingan was still disoriented, not fully aware that he had cultivated a life-bound flying sword, nor did he realize that this flying sword had manifested, deploying its life-bound powers to protect its master. Thus, wherever Chen Pingan walked, it created an almost natural small realm around him.

Bai Momo was as astonished to see the elderly figure as she would have been if her own son-in-law had finally cultivated a life-bound flying sword. She quickly bowed and clasped her hands in respect to the Elder Sword Immortal before silently departing. As she left, the old woman raised her hand repeatedly.

Chen Pingan took a deep breath, first clasping his fists in respect to the Elder Sword Immortal before bowing, yet remained silent.

Everything was conveyed without words.

Chen Qingdu walked slowly up to the Dragon-Slaying Cliff, with Chen Pingan closely following.

As he walked, Chen Qingdu spoke, "She once had great merit for the human race; this is an old story I remember well, one I have kept for ten thousand years. When you first arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall, I had already noticed some clues. Although the three caverns no longer had her three strands of sword energy lingering around them, that aura was one I knew all too well. After all, my swordsmanship came from her previous master. However, aside from worrying that this might be a scheme of some hidden puppet master, I also have my selfishness. I, Chen Qingdu, owe her a favor; how I repay it and when, I decide for myself. So, I pretended not to see her little hints, neither rebuilding the Eternal Life Bridge for you nor assisting in cultivating your life-bound flying sword, all so that I can still have a reunion after ten thousand years. I owe her, not you, Chen Pingan. If she is unhappy, she can come find me at the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Chen Qingdu sat on a bench, facing south towards the Sword Qi Great Wall, and sighed, "How many ancient people are my old friends, even juniors? How many ancient deities and savage beasts have been my enemies, even the souls lost under my sword? There is a great desolation here that you wouldn't understand."

Chen Qingdu chuckled, "It's been many years since I've looked at the city walls from such a distance. I remember when it was just built, I stood over there on today's Tai Xiang Street, joking with Long Jun and Guan Zhao, saying that with this high wall, it could withstand for ten thousand years. And indeed, it has."

Turning to Chen Pingan, Chen Qingdu expressed his approval, "Today's fortunes are not something you begged for, nor something anyone bestowed upon you; it is something you fought for yourself."

Chen Pingan stood up and clasped his fists, saying, "I must still thank the Elder Sword Immortal for your teachings and guidance."

Chen Qingdu replied, "If we put it that way, it’s somewhat acceptable. However, looking at the process through the lens of a good outcome, there's kindness everywhere. Looking back at life with a bad ending, there's malice at every turn."

Chen Pingan laughed, "As a junior, I only speak of the facts, highlighting the good. I have no courage to drone on about grievances with the Elder Sword Immortal."

This was the truth. If the first time at the Sword Qi Great Wall had gone smoothly, with the Eternal Life Bridge rebuilt and him becoming a sword cultivator on the rise, there would have been far fewer surprises. He wouldn’t have needed to carry a long sword to Tongye Continent to seek the East Sea Observance, which possibly could have avoided the subsequent bloodshed in Old Dragon City, the ordeal of the Book Lake where he had to rely on heart cultivation due to insufficient realms, the dire situation set up by Jingguan City’s Gao Cheng and He Xiaoliang, and the exhausting, thankless battles against the heavenly tribulations. If all those changes had occurred, it would have been an entirely different landscape, and whether that life was better or worse, he would never have the chance to know.

As for the current predicament at the Sword Qi Great Wall, if he were to complain, Chen Pingan could argue with the Elder Sword Immortal for several days.

Chen Qingdu nodded, "You, kid, have some ties with your elders, after all."

Chen Pingan quietly asked, "When can I reopen that item of mine? When the war escalates, I will definitely accompany Ning Yao and the others to leave the city and fight."

He only stated half of his thoughts.

The other half being that without that item, I wouldn’t be able to gather scraps and earn my honest money. If I were to carry a large sack around, how could I avoid running into the dragons and such? Wouldn’t I have to speak some just words?

Chen Qingdu was puzzled, "For such trivial matters, why not ask Yan Ming instead of me?"

Initially, Chen Pingan was skeptical, always feeling that with Uncle Yan's style and having been chosen by the Elder Sword Immortal to help him smuggle through the Inverted Mountain to the Sword Respect Pavilion, how could he let such a large flaw occur with an item containing the sword immortal's painting? However, he quickly understood—indeed, it was a trivial issue—he could just borrow an item from the wealthy Uncle Yan.

Chen Qingdu didn't mind Chen Pingan's little calculations, estimating that this kid would borrow, but whether he would return it was hard to say.

However, the so-called ties with elders were quite accurate. Uncle Yan, who had immense expectations for his only son Yan Zhuo, would not hesitate to lend him an item, whether for public or private matters.

Although Uncle Yan’s swordsmanship was not high, he was excellent at generating wealth, so he would have a special fondness for Chen Pingan. This was quite different from Yue Qing's changed impression of this young outsider; Uncle Yan had regarded Chen Pingan highly from the very beginning.

While appearing indifferent to everything, Chen Qingdu was, in fact, keeping every junior sword cultivator in his heart.

Suddenly, Chen Qingdu said, "Your two life-bound flying swords are not merely an offense and defense. Unlike your peers Qi Shou and Gao Ye, their several flying swords have considerable killing power and are not to be underestimated. However, the further they progress, the less possibility there is of connecting multiple flying swords together compared to you."

One must know that Confucian sages preside over the academy, while the mountain gods and water deities reign over their mountains and rivers, capable of reaching a higher realm.

As for Chen Pingan's life-bound flying sword, which the elder praised as a "caged sparrow," whether it has such an elevated divine ability remains to be discovered and excavated by Chen Pingan himself.

Once one becomes a sword cultivator and possesses a life-bound flying sword, having passed the most difficult barrier of "creating something out of nothing," the path of cultivation thereafter would provide the confidence to discuss lofty ideals and enjoy freedom of body and mind.

Chen Qingdu stood up, smiling, "Finally, there are some decent means at your disposal."

On the verge of returning to the Sword Qi Great Wall, the elder turned to Chen Pingan and asked, "How was it, being washed by sword intent along with the flow of time, that feeling of having one's form disintegrate while the bones stand firm?"

Chen Pingan also rose, forcing a smile, "It was incomparably harder to endure than when I practiced punches back in my homeland; I absolutely don’t want to go through that again."

Chen Qingdu smiled, "What a coincidence."

Chen Pingan, beads of sweat forming on his forehead, shook his head with a serious expression, "Elder Sword Immortal, could we skip the coincidences?"

Chen Qingdu insisted, "It was indeed a coincidence."

Chen Pingan resignedly said, "As you say, senior."

Chen Qingdu chuckled, "This time, the process of form disintegration and body melting will take much longer."

Chen Pingan trembled, asking, "Now that I’m a sword cultivator, why must it be so?"

Chen Qingdu provided an answer that Chen Pingan would never have imagined: "The resentment of youth is not to be trifled with."

After the elder finished speaking, he vanished from sight.

The entire Ningfu's Dragon-Slaying Cliff and that small pavilion unexpectedly transformed into a small realm that even a sword immortal's strike would find hard to breach. Chen Pingan was suppressed within, sitting in the center of the pavilion.

From the top of the pavilion, sword light poured down like an exceedingly slow-moving strange waterfall, crashing down upon Chen Pingan's head. His golden-body martial physique felt as if it were a piece of porcelain, about to shatter but not quite, revealing countless cracks, especially where his head and face, the first to "bathe" in the waterfall of sword intent, bore the brunt. If Chen Pingan could still have his Yin spirit venture forth, he would find that his real body appeared even more ghastly than the face of the lady of the Flying Eagle Fortress from Tongye Continent. Not only was the skin damaged, but even his eye sockets began to slowly crack. The most torturous part was that this transformation spread gradually, akin to the growth of vegetation. This was in stark contrast to his earlier experience in Ningfu's secret chamber, where he had faced a rapid onslaught—two extremes.

And when the waterfall hit the ground, it did not break free from the Dragon-Slaying Cliff and the small pavilion's realm; instead, it resembled an ancient well collecting heavenly rain, with the water level gradually rising above Chen Pingan’s knees.

This was more than just a matter of placing oneself in the path of a white blade; it was akin to a grinding death where heaven and earth converged.

Washing the sword—only sword cultivators washed swords; who would wash their own physical body as if it were a sword being refined?

The old woman sensed the heavenly phenomena from afar and felt relieved, "I never expected my son-in-law has become a sword cultivator and is practicing his sword even more diligently."

Over at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the left and right asked, "How is it?"

Chen Qingdu smiled, "First, you must hold a long sword, aiming the tip directly at the beasts of the wild world. Then, with the life-bound flying sword, you can restrain Chen Qingdu. As your senior brother, what do you expect of your junior?"

The left and right maintained serious expressions, replying in unison, "It's the big senior brother and the little junior brother."

Chen Qingdu clicked his tongue, "I ask you to save some face for the Confucian lineage."

The left and right were in high spirits, and this time, they truly did not care, but couldn’t help furrowing their brows, asking, "Now that you have a life-bound flying sword, why not rush to the battlefield immediately?"

Chen Qingdu replied, "I asked him to come, but that brat has become a sword cultivator and is too proud to come."

The left and right laughed heartily, "Still, Elder Sword Immortal cares about face."

Suddenly, Chen Qingdu said, "A war is ultimately not just a fight; your little junior brother understands this better than you. However, there are some words I will tell you later."

This time, the demon clan's army attacking the city soon created an extraordinarily spectacular surprise.

On the battlefield, five towering mountains directly stood tall, lined up in succession, all being the highest peaks of the wild world. This was the Mountain-Relocation Divine Ability of the great demon Zhen Guang, and after this battle, this ascending realm great demon would be severely injured, essentially withdrawing from the subsequent siege warfare, taking time to recuperate within the General's tent. The cost of relocating the Five Peaks was certainly not limited to the loss of Zhen Guang’s cultivation.

For example, the mountain gods originally stationed at these five peaks were all high-level mountain deities of the wild world. Now, they had merged with the mountain altars and golden bodies into the luck of the Five Peaks.

If it weren’t for this, even if the great demons of the wild world could move the Five Peaks, they would not have been able to break through the sword qi torrents, and thus would never have reached this battlefield.

Though these five mountains seemed only to be halfway compared to the Sword Qi Great Wall, to all the sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall, it was a monumental problem.

Not only did the demon clan advance rapidly and stably on the battlefield, but also the five mountains that appeared out of nowhere each had a protective great formation shimmering with treasure light. Within the formations were the powerful cultivators from the wild world who had set up their formations long before. They had essentially given half their lives in exchange. For Zhen Guang to successfully throw the five great mountains here, it required not only his own cultivation but also the meticulous layout of the demon clan during the first unveiling battle, creating geographical changes on the battlefield. Coupled with the spells and treasures of the mountain cultivators, they had decisively severed the roots and water veins of the mountains, ultimately refining the five peaks and delivering them to the ascending realm great demon Zhen Guang, allowing for such a grand display.

Thus, the cost was enormous, yet once accomplished, it was time for the sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall to risk their lives and flying swords to pay the debt.

Additionally, the great demon who was once the ruler of the Yiluo River, the dragon-robed woman of imperial crown, appeared to have taken over for the previous skeletal great demon Bai Ying, now responsible for the latest stage of the siege.

She went by the alias Yang Zhi, and in the wild world, not everyone was unaware of her true name. However, those qualified to know this matter were all ancient beings who knew her well. Whether they could call out her true name mattered little; they would not genuinely fight to the death. She had transferred all the rivers and lakes under her jurisdiction, including the Yiluo River, to another great demon. But before relinquishing her assets, she naturally held back, capturing several great rivers' waters into her life-bound object.

At this moment, the five peaks stood tall, and she personally occupied one of the mountain tops. She didn't reveal her monstrous true form but appeared like a noblewoman casually wandering through the mountains. At the foot of one of the great mountains, she smiled and gently bent down, shaking out five green water pearls from her dragon-robed sleeves, saying with a smile, "Go, let the mountains remain still while the waters flow, and serve as a moat."

In the end, a turbulent river appeared at the foot of each of the five peaks, encircling them. The waters were fierce, brimming with murderous intent, and many lonely souls and wandering ghosts that had survived on the battlefield would soon be turned into vengeful spirits as they were drawn into the waters.

In fact, before the rivers and mountains were intertwined, many sword immortals, each with their own roles, decisively drew their swords almost simultaneously. Some split mountains, while others saved many life-bound flying swords of mid-level sword cultivators who couldn’t retreat in time.

Even though the sword immortals struck quickly, over a hundred life-bound flying swords of sword cultivators were directly suppressed and shattered by the five suddenly appearing mountains.

If it weren’t for a sword immortal not known for their great killing power using their life-bound flying sword to manifest a golden body, stubbornly shouldering the mountain, effectively stalling its rooting momentarily, the losses in the battlefield where mid-level sword cultivators had unleashed their swords would have been unimaginable.

This time, even Nalan Shao Wei did not hold back; she slashed out her slender, bright red flying sword, which instantly transformed into a long, fiery red dragon, wrapping around one of the great mountains. The mountain trembled under the impact, stones rolling down, and countless plants being crushed.

The dragon of Nalan Shao Wei’s flying sword clashed with the river of the peak great demon Yang Zhi, with the dragon raising enormous waves and crashing against the mountain.

Lu Zhi almost simultaneously drew her sword to cut the mountain, while Yue Qing, Yao Lianyun, and Li Tuimi also took their turns to strike.

Indeed, this ploy of the wild world was fraught with endless consequences.

Its impact on the subsequent battlefield dynamics was profound. One wrong move could give the enemy a foothold akin to five cities, and with the various methods of the other great demons, it would be easy for them to encompass the entire battlefield, turning it into a treacherous standoff between mountains and city walls.

Around the five peaks, celestial maidens adorned with colorful ribbons and holding pipa instruments appeared, standing at the height of ordinary women, yet numbering in the thousands, forming an additional protective great formation.

They each played the pipa, producing heavenly sounds that were both gentle and powerful, intertwined with the spiritual energy of the waters. The mist rose, ultimately transforming into strands of emerald silk that soared skyward, connecting with their flowing garments, as if draping the five peaks in a translucent green veil.

Li Tuimi directly challenged the central mountain, where the dragon-robed woman manifested a pitch-black dharma form, grasping a massive flying sword that Li Tuimi had intended to use to slay some demon cultivators on the mountain peak. However, after being personally blocked by the great demon Yang Zhi, Li Tuimi, the premier protector of the Yan family, not only didn’t worry about whether his sword would be seized and injure the sword immortal's foundation, but instead erupted in fierceness, summoning a second life-bound flying sword, "Silver Thread," and lifted it between the mountain and the city walls, launching a long silver sword light aimed straight at the dharma form’s brow. Li Tuimi himself rode the wind forward, holding his long sword in a straight line, like a long rainbow hanging in the air.

The dharma form was enormous, while the sword immortal's figure was minuscule, almost like an ant shaking a tree.

Li Tuimi's celestial companion, along with three direct disciples, had all died at the hands of the great demons of the Yiluo River.

So, a solitary figure was he.

At this moment, if not now, when?

The woman smiled seductively, "The courage of a great sword immortal is indeed considerable. Let me take away that courage."

At the five peaks, two large protective formations, and thousands of demon cultivators specializing in talismans, along with over a thousand pieces of magical artifacts, plus Yang Zhi personally overseeing one of them.

Even if the sword immortals worked together with all their might, how could they easily shake the foundations?

The left and right didn’t care; even if they were unfamiliar with that sword immortal, they felt that anyone who dared to say something so brazen should not die!

Knowing that the bloodthirsty Li Tuimi had already made up his mind to blow himself up along with his two swords and his entire being to destroy most of that central mountain, it was to win a chance for the sword cultivators behind him to shatter the mountains. If the five peaks were allowed to firmly root themselves in the battlefield, forming an increasingly stable foundation of roots and water veins, future wars would only become more challenging.

Having all five peaks intact was vastly different from just losing one while retaining the other four.

Li Tuimi simply advanced with his sword.

In a great battle, how could any of our sword immortals die? Would everyone just sit back and watch while those younger generations, like Yan Xiaopang, perished first? 

For ten thousand years, such a saying had never existed at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The left swung his sword and cleaved the pitch-black dharma form in two.

But Li Tuimi, instead of retreating back to the city, burst forth in brilliant sword light and plunged into the summit of that central mountain.

"Everyone, I, Li Tuimi, shall go ahead."

Yang Zhi raised her brow, and her墨色龙袍 (black dragon robe) suddenly floated away from her body, covering the mountain like a cloth obscuring a bonsai, instantly enveloping the entire mountain to prevent that reckless sword immortal from completely destroying the mountain formation and its roots. This way, the relentless assaults of the opposing sword immortals would be hard to withstand, and the hidden plots lying deep would emerge prematurely. If the mountains gathered on the battlefield, and if the Sword Qi Great Wall did not exert enough pressure, then the enemy would naturally stabilize their foothold, as if pushing the battlefield hundreds of miles closer to the Sword Qi Great Wall. If the sword immortals did not relent and did not strike decisively, it would be even better, as it would become a situation where they mutually fed each other, each time sending in troops, each time falling short, and thus would consume each other. This was precisely the situation that the wild world desired to see because those who could provide reinforcements from the Sword Qi Great Wall were certainly at the Jade Pure realm level.

In the unveiling battle, the wild world intentionally struck lightly, but in this second round, they intended to inflict serious injuries on the Sword Qi Great Wall—directly killing off a batch of sword immortals!

But Li Tuimi's act of seeking death had infuriated the former mistress of the Yiluo River.

Yang Zhi and the other four peak great demons, sharing a telepathic link, instructed one another not to rush, especially the elder hidden in the central mountain, whom Yang Zhi firmly forbade from acting independently.

What surprised her even more was that the left and right, failing to save their comrades, made an unimaginable strike. Just as Li Tuimi resolutely self-destructed his golden core, primordial infant, all his souls, and both swords, he was being suppressed by Yang Zhi's dharma robe of celestial rank, not expected to even destroy half of the protective formation. The impact on the roots would be minimal, but the left directly wielded a sword, breaking through the black dragon robe enveloping the mountain and cleaving Li Tuimi!

Originally, Li Tuimi, whose sword light had been restrained by the black dragon robe, laughed silently and left this world completely.

After this strike, Li Tuimi died, and both of his life-bound flying swords exploded with a thunderous roar, resulting in a celestial sword cultivator leaving no trace of his soul, causing the entire mountaintop to shatter. Not only that, but over a hundred demon talisman cultivators, below the primordial infant level, directly linked to the protective formation, died en masse, which then caused the entire great mountain's roots, which had been slowly stabilizing, to violently quake.

After the left dealt out that sword that would undoubtedly invite endless controversy in the Haoran realm, he did not withdraw but instead surged forth with a torrent of sword qi, landing on the now significantly shorter central peak, driving his sword into the mountaintop.

How big could a mountain be? Could it truly withstand the sword qi of the left?

Great demon Yang Zhi was furious; she decisively sacrificed a celestial robe to stabilize the mountain’s luck. Moreover, she instructed one of her peers, also a great demon, who was her half companion, not to intervene. Killing the left would be too difficult; she would just entangle him herself while needing to slay a few more sword immortals like Li Tuimi from the other four mountains. Otherwise, wouldn’t this second-stage layout turn into a huge joke?

She revealed her true form, her massive body soaring high to the mountain summit. As for the collateral damage to her own talisman cultivators along the way, Yang Zhi didn’t care a whit.

Except for the central peak, which was in great turmoil, the other four peaks remained relatively stable—but only relatively speaking.

The Hidden Official, who had been toying with braids, watched this scene with bright eyes, feeling invigorated.

She turned to glance at Chen Qingdu.

The elder said, "Go play yourself."

The Hidden Official slightly bent her knees, and the city walls trembled violently. The little girl, as petite as she was, left the city.

She directly crashed through one of the mountains.

After landing, she brushed off the dust from her head and began to dart back and forth across the ground, repeatedly using her head to bore through the mountain's body.

Every time the little girl opened a mountain, she would be somewhat covered in dirt, yet she wandered joyously, looking quite happy.

The two friends from Aiai Continent, who seemed more like fishermen or woodcutters than sword immortals, Zhang Shao and Li Ding, exchanged smiles. 

If it were just the usual back-and-forth battles, that would be fine; they would take every moment they could, and killing more beasts would not weigh on their conscience. But since the enemy had just brought forth this water and mountain tactic, how could they allow a bunch of creatures lacking in literary knowledge to gain momentum and take the lead?

Absolutely not.

Thus, without needing words, the two sword immortals, almost simultaneously, took off from the Sword Qi Great Wall. Like two hastily falling meteors, they chose a mountain, one landing at the foot and the other halfway up.

In the world, fishermen enjoy boating, and Zhang Shao was no exception; yet this would be his last chance to enjoy the mountains and waters, and he did not need to be overly pretentious.

Sword immortal Zhang Shao stepped directly into the river of the Yiluo River's affiliation, smiling, "Zhang Shao, sword cultivator of Aiai Continent."

Meanwhile, Li Ding, who climbed the mountain behind Zhang Shao, smiled knowingly, "What a coincidence; I too am a sword cultivator from Aiai Continent."

The two sword immortals calmly faced death, directly destroying the entire mountain’s roots and water veins.

On the city walls, the Elder Sword Immortal squinted at a certain spot, then took a step forward.

The gray-robed elder at the northern gate smiled, "No need to rush; we are responsible for wrapping things up. As long as you don’t act, I certainly won’t. After all, Chen Qingdu's greatest ability is merely to watch as each of his juniors dies before his eyes."

The gray-robed elder looked towards the great demon Yang Zhi and instructed her.

Within each of the five peaks, the greatest trump cards no longer concealed themselves, whether they were ascending realm great demons or celestial sword cultivators, all emerging from their hidden locations. As for whether the mountains could continue to root themselves in the battlefield, the lives of the thousands of talisman-cultivating demon cultivators on the mountains, and how long the protective formation could withstand the sword immortals' strikes, had become irrelevant.

The four great demons flew towards the central peak to join forces with Yang Zhi, who revealed her true form.

Surrounding the left and right!

In the central peak's territory, a short elder hovering on his sword suddenly grew to a height of several dozen feet, his white brows and hair flying, shouldering a long staff, slowly rising into the sky. During this time, every time he opened his mouth to inhale, dozens of pipa girls were swallowed up like chewing beans.

Dong Sangeng laughed loudly, "That little brat..."

Chen Xi and Qi Tingji intended to follow Dong Sangeng away from the city walls.

The three old sword immortals each bore a monumental mark on the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Yet Chen Qingdu said, "Let the left and right forge swords with lives at stake; the Haoran realm is not a place for idle fighting; here, we have enough. Life that is too smooth and solitary does not lead to great swordsmanship."

Dong Sangeng was heading toward the battlefield, while the Hidden Official, still playing on the battlefield, along with the left and right, needed to confront Yang Zhi and the elder on their swords, alongside the other four great demons.

On the city walls, Yan Zhuo bit his lip, remaining silent.

Elsewhere, Cheng Quan and Qi Shou were wholly focused on the battlefield, not noticing Chen Pingan, who remained motionless, his face a mask of struggle.

Once Chen Pingan's Yin spirit was free to act, it was already too late.

On the battlefield, an unexpected occurrence larger than the sudden appearance of the mountains took place.

The Hidden Official shattered the sword intent, directly piercing through the left's abdomen.

Had the left not dodged at the last moment, he would have had his heart crushed.

Immediately retreating several miles, the left was caught by Dong Sangeng, who endured the full force of the elder’s strike, pulling the left away from the battlefield.

The entire Sword Qi Great Wall, aside from a few sword cultivators, was stunned, shocked beyond measure.

The Hidden Official spat out a mouthful of blood, turned her head to look at Chen Qingdu, and raised her middle finger, "The old never die ought to die; may you die!"

Chen Qingdu remained expressionless, merely glancing at the Hidden Official, his gaze then turning to Dong Sangeng and the left, muttering to himself, "Left, your little junior brother warned me earlier to be wary of that Hidden Official."

Aside from Dong Sangeng, even Chen Xi and Qi Tingji had to tread carefully, for Chen Xi harbored too much resentment, and Qi Tingji had too much ambition. Most importantly, both of these old sword immortals, who had achieved great feats, felt no guilt toward the Sword Qi Great Wall, yet bore profound hatred toward the entire Haoran realm. However, Chen Pingan had only recorded thirty-seven major incidents regarding these two old sword immortals and six key phrases, still unable to definitively predict whether they would turn against the wild world; it would ultimately be up to the Elder Sword Immortal.

On the ground, the Hidden Official waved her hand, summoning the sword cultivators Zhu An and Luo Shan, who had been attacking a nearby mountain, to stop their swords and join her, turning their backs to the Sword Qi Great Wall and heading towards the wild world.

On the Sword Qi Great Wall, Pang Yuanji swayed, ultimately collapsing on the city walls, tears streaming down the face of this young sword cultivator.

He couldn't understand why it had come to this.

Without that overwhelming presence, Chen Pingan finally moved freely, but he neither scolded Chen Qingdu for deliberately hiding the truth nor checked on his injured senior brother, the left. The world’s right and wrong, good and bad, ebb and flow—it was never simple. So, Chen Pingan merely sat in place, opening his folding fan to cover most of his face, revealing only his piercing eyes, firmly fixated on the southern battlefield, slowly saying, "Let the fight begin."

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 736: The New Hidden Official**

The battle was exceptionally brief and intense, its scale so small that the rapid casualties felt like a chance encounter between scouts from opposing armies.

The Wildlands did not immediately launch the next offensive. It was evident that many key military commanders had not anticipated this outcome, and with so many surprises, they had to adjust various strategic details within the established framework.

As a result, the battlefield yielded only three remaining mountains. The central peak, which had been thoroughly shattered by the skirmish between the Left and Right, was completely destroyed. The other peak was devastated by two foreign sword immortals from the White Snow Continent, who paid with their lives to destroy the mountain's foundation and waterways, and then it was brutally cleaved in two by Lu Zhi's sword light.

The remaining three mountains were already in disarray. One had previously been ravaged by the Renowned Officials’ faction, the Sword Immortals Luo Shan and Zhu An, which was likely the last achievement of these two traitorous sword immortals.

If they were to meet again in the future, it would be a matter of exchanging swords, asking questions, and sharing life and death with former comrades and fellow sword immortals.

Atop those three peaks, some lucky talisman practitioners from the demon race who had not perished could only await their demise. Even if they managed to escape far away, what would be the point? Their lives were already tied to the fate of the mountains. Some among them, with fierce tempers and ruthless decisiveness, called upon friends to coordinate efforts to reopen the mountain defense formation, fighting to the last breath in hopes of forcing the Sword Immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall to expend at least one more sword strike.

Sword Immortal Zhao Ge Yi found Cheng Quan and together they flew with their swords toward a mountain. Zhao Ge Yi aimed to protect Cheng Quan's formation and help him assimilate the mountain's energy for his own use.

“Damn it! I feel like a traitor just stepping out of the city!” Cheng Quan exclaimed, filled with grief and anger. “Those treacherous bastards, Zhu An and Luo Shan! Before today, I would have willingly traded my life for either of them! Zhao Ge Yi, tell me, will you stab me in the back too in the future? If you will, be straightforward about it. When we get to the mountaintop, I just hope you strike quickly and decisively, like a man, so I can die faster.”

Zhao Ge Yi retorted angrily, “How could Song Caiyun possibly like someone as useless as you?!”

Cheng Quan’s face fell.

The Sword Qi Great Wall had won this stage of the war, but no sword cultivator atop the wall felt any joy.

The Hidden Official had actually betrayed the Sword Qi Great Wall, leading the traitorous Luo Shan and Zhu An to throw themselves into the Wildlands. The Hidden Official had even severely injured the previously invincible Left in the earlier battle.

Except for those sword immortals with sufficiently clear hearts, almost all sword cultivators felt a shadow looming over their hearts, especially the younger ones.

Chen Ping’an, with his folding fan at his waist, rode a talisman vessel toward the thatched cottage.

Inside the small thatched cottage, which had once been the temporary dwelling of the Sword Immortal Wei Jin from the Storm and Snow Temple, the Left sat on the bed, his abdomen punctured by a fist, a gaping hole that sword energy struggled to mend.

Sword energy could not produce flesh and bone, as this was merely the second dangerous melee. The Left needed to use sword energy to counter the aftereffects of the Hidden Official's punch.

Otherwise, for a top-tier sword cultivator who refined their body through sword crafting, even severe injuries should not provoke such horror in the nearby Dong San Geng, who felt it was dire.

Dong San Geng guarded the doorway, his voice raised in anger. “Chen Qingdu, what the hell is going on?! Is the Hidden Official possessed or something?!”

From a distance, Chen Qingdu did not turn his head, calmly stating, “You’re not blind; what you see is the truth.”

Dong San Geng was livid, for this old sword immortal had always had a good impression of the Hidden Official, thinking of him as a rare kindred spirit. Moreover, the old sword immortal’s most cherished grandson, once seen as the next candidate for the Sword Immortal title, Dong Guanpu, had shared a strong bond with the Hidden Official in their youth.

Dong San Geng had already spotted the young man, who had just put away his talisman vessel, and was still fuming, loudly confronting Chen Qingdu. “Then why didn’t you just kill him?!”

Chen Qingdu sneered, “Dong Guanpu defected to the Wildlands. That scandal is known to the entire Sword Qi Great Wall. Do I need to know it? Did I kill him before things blew up?”

Chen Ping’an pretended he hadn’t heard anything.

Years ago, after the sword immortals gathered at the wall, the eldest sword immortal personally slew Dong Guanpu before Chen Ping’an's eyes. However, back then, he was still quite naive and did not truly understand the Sword Qi Great Wall.

What puzzled Chen Ping’an the most was when Ning Yao later remarked that the young Dong was a good person.

As a sword immortal, a member of the Dong family, betraying the Sword Qi Great Wall was undeniably true. But was he really a good person? 

How was one to reconcile this?

Perhaps for the eldest sword immortal, defending the Sword Qi Great Wall was simply about keeping it intact.

Dong San Geng suppressed his fury and told Chen Ping’an that his senior brother wouldn’t die, then directly left the scene.

Chen Ping’an did not enter the thatched cottage but gently closed the door behind him.

Having witnessed such a grand and harrowing war where both sword immortals and great demons fell, one could not help but feel their insignificance more deeply.

Having seen all the choices made by the eldest sword immortal, Chen Ping’an felt that if he could revisit the Heart-Questioning Session at Shujian Lake, even with the same cultivation level as back then, he could truly move as he desired.

He did not linger at the cottage but headed toward Ning Yao and the others.

Ning Yao glanced at Yan Zhuo and then shook her head at Chen Ping’an.

Chen Ping’an nodded, signaling he understood.

Yan Zhuo’s eyes were red, hands clenched on his knees.

The chief offering of the family, the sword immortal Li Tui Mi, had fallen.

This old man had once been the object of Yan Zhuo’s hatred in his youth; many painful words were spoken by Li Tui Mi, who looked down upon the young master of the Yan family, turning the once-cherubic Yan Zhuo into a laughingstock across the Sword Qi Great Wall. Otherwise, given the Yan family's standing and resources, if not for their own people initiating trouble, who would dare to mistreat the only heir of Yan Zhuo?

Even though Yan Zhuo had later transformed through countless battles to become a true sword cultivator and made life-and-death friends with Ning Yao and Chen Sanqiu, Li Tui Mi, as a family offering, had still refused to acknowledge him.

Yan Zhuo had begged Li Tui Mi several times to teach him swordsmanship, but the old man had only ever claimed to be an old bone, living a humble life, too afraid to instruct the heir of the Yan family, as that would mislead him.

Who would have thought that when Li Tui Mi finally agreed to teach, his face stern yet a hint of laughter in his eyes, that he would suddenly perish, becoming the first major sword immortal to die on the battlefield.

Chen Ping’an sat beside Yan Zhuo, offering no words of comfort, for here in the Sword Qi Great Wall, with Yan Zhuo beside him, there was no need.

Anyone could endure this.

As for the pain of losing a loved one, who would be unfamiliar with it? Besides the deceased Li Tui Mi, there were those still alive, such as Wu Chengpei, Tao Wen, Zhou Cheng, and others, all sharing the same fate.

Sword immortals were no exception, let alone those sword cultivators. As for the countless broken natal flying swords and those suffering immensely, who were not in the same boat?

The last words of the eldest sword immortal, fortunate only for Chen Ping’an to have heard them, carried too much weight and significance.

For instance, the Hidden Official, knowing Dong Guanpu was a traitor, had deliberately avoided punishing him.

Chen Qingdu would not say much more, dragging it out, letting that thoughtful young boy, Dong Guanpu, live a day longer, if only to allow him to live another day.

If it weren’t for your Dong San Geng’s insufficient swordsmanship and insufficient military contributions, failing to intimidate the great families of Tai Xiang Street and Xuan Hu Street, inciting their collective ire, and being unable to protect the traitorous grandson’s life through military achievements, you would have been able to keep Dong Guanpu alive. This led to a group of sword immortals demanding justice from the Sword Qi Great Wall. Otherwise, if the Hidden Official’s faction had chosen to ignore it, Chen Qingdu would have turned a blind eye, permitting the Dong family to detain the unworthy grandson, or at most, sending him to Old Deaf’s prison—nothing more.

Ning Yao sat next to Chen Ping’an. “Are you alright?”

Chen Ping’an quietly replied, “Very well.”

Ning Yao had many questions, but there were so many that she didn’t know how to start.

Chen Ping’an gently said, “You don’t need to worry about anything; leave the thinking to me.”

Together, they gazed toward the south.

Yan Zhuo suddenly asked, “Am I in the way for you two?”

Chen Ping’an opened his folding fan, fanning Ning Yao with a smile, “Everyone should be more aware of their surroundings.”

That young man, who was about to sit next to Ning Yao, paused midway, neither standing nor sitting, striking a peculiar pose.

Unexpectedly, Chen Sanqiu sat beside Yan Zhuo, Fan Dache sat next to Dong Huafu, and Die Zhong sat beside Chen Sanqiu.

In the end, everyone turned to gaze into the distance.

Silently waiting for the next battle.

Pang Yuanji remained silent for a long time.

Regarded as the next generation's appointed Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall, his heart was filled with despair and gloom.

Next to Pang Yuanji sat the young sword cultivator Gao Youqing, sitting dumbly, wanting to speak but hesitating, never daring to say a word.

Gao Ye Hou approached Pang Yuanji and sat beside him, saying just two words: “Bear it.”

Pang Yuanji's gaze was vacant.

Gao Ye Hou remained silent for a moment before saying, “If you really want to know the answer, don’t sink too deep into despair. Instead, strive to one day personally ask the Hidden Official, let her tell you the answer herself!”

Pang Yuanji mumbled, “You aren’t me, and I’m not you; that’s impossible.”

Gao Ye Hou scoffed, “Fine then, from today on, the Hidden Official’s faction may as well be extinguished.”

Unexpectedly, behind the two, a little girl had quietly arrived, her arms crossed over her chest, declaring, “I’m here to take care of the incense; that’s settled.”

Pang Yuanji forced a smile and turned to ask, “Lv Duan, why didn’t you leave the Sword Qi Great Wall back then? Sword Immortal Guo Jia and Chen Ping’an actually hoped you would go.”

Guo Zhu Jiu’s eyes sparkled as she shook her head. “No matter how much I respect and admire my father and master, that’s their opinion. As a sword cultivator, shouldn’t I have my own way of living and dying?”

Pang Yuanji could only smile bitterly.

He understood the reasoning, but what could he do?

Gao Ye Hou raised his thumb and laughed, “Lv Duan, well said!”

Guo Zhu Jiu looked at Gao Ye Hou with resignation. “What are you praising me for? You should commend my master for teaching well. That’s two praises in one; you’re not very insightful.”

Gao Ye Hou was momentarily speechless.

It seemed that only Ning Yao and Dong could gain the upper hand when dealing with the young Lv Duan.

Gao Youqing, unable to hold back, broke into laughter.

Guo Zhu Jiu cast a pitying glance at the little girl. “Crying and laughing, you’ve really lost your mind; turns out you’re just a little brat.”

Gao Youqing tugged at Gao Ye Hou’s sleeve. Gao Ye Hou laughed, “So now you’re looking for your brother?”

Guo Zhu Jiu shook her head, imitating her master’s gesture of hands tucked into sleeves, and walked away, muttering, “Little brat, a little girl who won’t grow up, throwing water that can’t be spilled; so troublesome.”

Gao Youqing’s face flushed bright red.

Gao Ye Hou felt a bit troubled himself, dealing with such a sister with her elbow turned outward.

Pang Yuanji’s smile was forced as he continued to look toward the south, farther south, as if still hoping to catch a glimpse of his master.

On the Sword Qi Great Wall, all the sword cultivators from the White Snow Continent who were familiar with the two sword immortals, Zhang Shao and Li Ding, were also filled with boundless sorrow.

The two sword immortals, known for their carefree lives in the White Snow Continent, had been recognized as peaceful and uncontentious, yet they had died on the battlefield in the Wildlands.

The White Snow Continent prioritized commerce, meaning it had many merchants. In truth, these sword cultivators, thirty-two in total, had varied levels of cultivation, yet they were considered oddities in their homeland.

Among them, the two with the highest cultivation levels were the generous Zhang Shao and Li Ding, both Yu Pu realm sword immortals.

The sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall regarded those few White Snow Continent sword cultivators without any strange glances, but deep inside, they felt discontent.

There was no need to elaborate on the Northern Ju Lu Continent; it was the realm with the most sword cultivators, unmatched by any other. The Southern Po Sa Continent was closest to the Hanging Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall, with hundreds of sword cultivators, thus there was no reason to compare. However, apart from these, the Fu Yao Continent, Liu Xia Continent, and Jin Jia Continent had far more sword cultivators than the White Snow Continent.

Only two remained with fewer sword cultivators than the White Snow Continent: the Bao Ping Continent, the smallest in the realm, but it had previously produced the sword immortal Wei Jin, a young sword immortal able to rival the local sword immortals in talent and great achievements, alongside Chen Ping’an, who was not even a sword cultivator but earned the respect of sword cultivators.

The last continent was the Tong Ye Continent, known for its dislike of interacting with other continents.

The Bao Ping Continent was plagued by internal strife, while the Tong Ye Continent was troubled by great demons.

Only the White Snow Continent remained peaceful, even likely to be the most stable place when the heavens above the realm collapsed, as it was the farthest from the Hanging Mountain, separated from the Southern Po Sa Continent by a vast territory filled with stars.

Yet, boats from the White Snow Continent heading to the Hanging Mountain were flourishing in business.

However, within the Sword Qi Great Wall, compatriots were seldom seen.

It made sense; the pursuit of the Dao was paramount, life was singular, and while the path of cultivation was magnificent and secure, why would one come here to die? Those who came could hardly blame those who did not.

Now that Zhang Shao and Li Ding, two sword immortals from their own continent, had died, it should have been an event that would embolden the younger generation of the White Snow Continent’s sword cultivators. 

Yet, there was not a hint of pride or relief; instead, it only deepened their gloom and dissatisfaction.

Somewhere atop the wall, a group of scholars in Confucian robes gathered.

Among them, Chen Chunan wore a grave expression.

He stood with his closest friends, Liu Xianyang and Qin Zhengxiu, and said worriedly, “If we defend, many will die—more and more. If we don’t defend, we’d be letting down the many who have already died, including the local sword immortal Li Tui Mi and the White Snow Continent’s Zhang Shao and Li Ding, who are so close. If I were that eldest sword immortal, my heart would have collapsed long ago.”

Liu Xianyang squatted down, chewing on a root he had picked up from who-knows-where, mumbling indistinctly, “Sword immortals and sword cultivators have long gotten used to the eldest sword immortal being stationed at the Sword Qi Great Wall. It’s been so long that it’s hard for anyone to truly imagine what this senior’s heart feels like.”

Qin Zhengxiu said solemnly, “Over the past ten thousand years, including this one, there have been a total of ninety-six great battles. We’ve never lost.”

Liu Xianyang added, “The battlefield is on the southern land and in the hearts of the people in the north. So while we’ve always won, we’ve continually lost as well.”

Chen Chunan suddenly spoke up, “Our Hao Ran realm cannot escape blame; it is a grievous mistake.”

This elder, who held the title of the most revered Confucian in the Hao Ran realm, spoke not in a whisper but directly.

Aside from Liu Xianyang, Chen Chunan, and other gentlemen of the Confucian school, the faces of those present changed slightly.

The Hidden Official, along with Luo Shan and Zhu An, swaggered into the general's tent.

An old man in gray stood outside the tent, smiling, “Don’t worry about us not having a fight. As long as you’re at the Ascension stage and didn’t contribute to this siege, you can choose anyone to fight. If you kill them, who dares to complain? Just keep killing.”

The Hidden Official nodded, reaching out to tug at a braid, shaking it lightly, and grinned, “Once we’re in the Hao Ran realm, give me half a continent's worth of Ascension stage cultivators, and I’ll kill them all. Those turtles with their shells full of meat will be thoroughly smashed!”

The gray-robed elder did not refuse; why would he refuse? This little girl before him was undeniably the best seed of the Dao in the Wildlands. The alignment of the Dao was unparalleled. Being beside Chen Qingdu was a constant torment for her; the Sword Qi Great Wall was never a place for her cultivation but a prison that constrained her true self. As a sword cultivator born and raised in the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Hidden Official certainly possessed a natal flying sword. Yet, she had never unleashed it in battle; she would only wield a sword from the sword shop, break it, and switch to fighting with her fists.

The gray-robed elder seldom felt regret, but one of the few regrets was that this Hidden Official, who had grown up in the Sword Qi Great Wall, hadn’t been born in the Wildlands and hadn’t gone to Mount Tuo Yue for cultivation early on. Otherwise, all fourteen seats in that ancient well would have shifted positions.

This elder from the Wildlands currently had only one person following him, a big-bearded man who carried a sword and a knife.

Luo Shan looked at the famous sword immortal in the Wildlands and asked, “Why didn’t you draw your sword or attack, letting Dong San Geng save the Left?”

The big-bearded man replied indifferently, “Since you’re a sword immortal and a lady, I’ll waste a word on you. Who I kill or spare doesn’t require me to explain to outsiders.”

Luo Shan was about to speak when he was stopped by Zhu An, who held his wrist.

The gray-robed elder laughed, “There’s no need to be so formal. According to the rules set by Mount Tuo Yue, you are esteemed guests of the Wildlands, and that will hold for a thousand years without a hint of doubt. If Liu Cha draws his sword against you, it will count as questioning the Dao of Mount Tuo Yue, right?”

At this moment, the elder looked at the big-bearded man.

Liu Cha remained silent.

Then the gray-robed elder casually said something, addressing not only the man named Liu Cha but also Luo Shan and Zhu An, as well as many great demons in the general's tent, “Our Wildlands is indeed an unrefined barbaric land; it is neither the Sword Qi Great Wall nor the Hao Ran realm. My rules are few but effective; those who defy them shall all die.”

The Hidden Official said seriously, “By the way, that foolish disciple of mine, Pang Yuanji, even if he goes out looking for death, don’t kill him. I’m still hoping he’ll ask me for a sword once again.”

The gray-robed elder chuckled helplessly, “Such trivial matters need not be mentioned. Just have Luo Shan and Zhu An each go through the Jiazi tent and the Wu Wu tent, and they should get the hang of things.”

The Hidden Official asked, “What about me?”

The gray-robed elder replied, “In the place that Chen Qingdu calls a rat nest, beneath the well, there are still some damned great demons that were lucky enough to survive; if you’re feeling bored, go kill them all. It might help you break through earlier.”

The Hidden Official blinked, “Are you afraid I’ll team up with Chen Qingdu and destroy your behind?”

By going to that rat nest and slaying those surviving Ascension stage great demons, she could steadily raise her cultivation, and in doing so, establish a connection with the entire Wildlands. 

She wanted to break through the Ascension stage bottleneck and become an immortal being on par with that old blind man; this was the price she needed to pay. The world is a furnace? Cultivation is a thieving act? Even the Ascension stage cannot escape this kind of shackle; to truly break through this barrier, one must achieve great feats, using their own small world to refine a part of the greater world! If all is refined, one becomes a sage of Confucianism or the Buddha and Dao patriarchs!

The gray-robed elder laughed heartily, “Just say whether you’re going or not.”

The Hidden Official beamed, rising into the air like a rainbow, speeding toward the rat nest.

At the Sword Qi Great Wall, what could she refine? The Sword Qi Great Wall? The Sword Qi Great Wall is Chen Qingdu; Chen Qingdu is the Sword Qi Great Wall!

But the Wildlands was different, for that gray-robed elder had not truly refined the entire world either, so she had her chance, and perhaps in the future, she could even wrestle with this ancient ancestor of the demon race.

Liu Cha frowned and asked, “Must we really clear the path for her like this?”

“One sword path, one knowledge, two great benefits—enough for you and Zhou Mi to fill your bellies. Good fortune can’t just be hoarded by you two,” the gray-robed elder chuckled, “If Chen Qingdu dies again, when I reach the Hao Ran realm, the Li Sheng should emerge from his retreat.”

“I want to see if it’s true that in times of chaos, a hero will rise to turn the tide in the Hao Ran realm.”

Liu Cha asked, “And Bai Ze?”

The gray-robed elder scoffed, “Similar to the old blind man; completely disappointed and utterly unhelpful.”

Liu Cha suddenly said, “In darkness lies light.”

The gray-robed elder laughed and asked, “Have you ever thought about which realm this phrase applies to best? Purely speaking, which realm has the purest thoughts?”

The gray-robed elder extended both hands, “In the Hao Ran realm, the hearts of the people are declining. But we are on the rise. This is the most unstoppable trend of all.”

The elder clenched his fists softly, whispering, “When we reach the Hao Ran realm, it will be your turn to draw your sword.”

Liu Cha nodded, “Then let it be so.”

The gray-robed elder suddenly patted the big-bearded man on the shoulder. “Once you get there and make the other side feel the pain, you’ll have the opportunity to see that Ah Liang again. At that time, we can compare skills, and I allow you to use a piece of land from the Hao Ran realm as a wager for your duel.”

Ah Liang had traversed many places in the Wildlands, killing countless demons, yet he had also genuinely become a friend to a sword hero, and that was this Liu Cha.

After Ah Liang returned to the Sword Qi Great Wall, he once joked with a group of children that Liu Cha had not disappointed anyone.

He was robust, rugged in appearance, heavy on righteousness, unrestrained, and could recite poetry.

Of course, after saying these trivial pleasantries, Ah Liang quickly returned to his nature, spat in his palm, slicked back his hair, and, with those astonished children, “leaked secrets,” before getting to the main point.

“That fellow is incredible, yet he still gets captivated by my charm. Without a second thought, he offered me his sword as a gift. I refused, and he insisted on using his knife as a pen, which is a shame, considering I’m a proper scholar. Liu Cha, isn’t this self-humiliation? If you don’t see me nodding in agreement, that guy wouldn’t stop writing—water from ancient times flowing into my palms, with fierce energy stretching a thousand miles, wearing down the ancient blade, and don’t take small grievances lightly... What? You haven’t heard a single word? Doesn’t matter; it’s average writing anyway. If you can’t remember, then forget it. But if any of you meet that Liu Cha on the battlefield later, don’t be afraid. If you can’t win, just shout that you’re a friend of Ah Liang.”

However, that self-proclaimed scholar Ah Liang, a gambler and drunkard, had spent over a hundred years at the Sword Qi Great Wall, never donning a scholar’s robe or hanging a jade pendant, never truly resembling a scholar.

When he left, he even did so without his sword, only with a knife and a conical hat.

No one knew that when Chen Qingdu bid him farewell, he said solemnly, “Once you leave, don’t come back. An outsider has no business staying at the Sword Qi Great Wall for so long. Even if you don’t leave, I must drive you out.”

The man only grinned while massaging the eldest sword immortal’s shoulder, jokingly saying, “If there’s good wine, save some for me. Whether I drink depends on my mood, but saving it is a matter of brotherhood.”

Yet in the end, before leaving the area near the thatched cottage, he turned his back to the elder and said, “If the Sword Qi Great Wall turns its sword point against me, then I won’t return. No matter how good the wine, who would I drink it with?”

After the battle against the skeletal great demon Bai Ying and the former master of the Fallen River, the role of commanding the demon army shifted to a great demon with countless palaces and pavilions, known by the name Huang Luan.

Huang Luan sat alone on the railing, as if in a celestial city filled with ethereal energy and the calls of cranes.

Within the city, there were the twenty seasonal climates, some elegant residences filled with the sounds of autumn cicadas, while others had newly sprouted willow leaves like delicate brows; the air above the Taoist temple was filled with “growing jade,” with snow piled on the ground. There were many enchanting talisman beauties, either applying yellow flowers in front of mirrors or fanning away fireflies.

In the residence where Huang Luan sat, there flowed a stream known as Ruoye Creek, which Huang Luan cherished most deeply. The water was crystal clear, inhabited by a talisman-formed old fisherman with white hair, and a beautiful girl washing silk, doing the same thing year after year.

Beneath this cloud city lay the demon army, now fully assembled and steadily advancing, composed of cultivators with considerable cultivation levels—over fifty thousand troops, all at least in the Cave Dwelling realm, equipped with spirit tools and magical treasures.

Thus, there was no need to breach the three sword formations of the Sword Qi Great Wall, nor to swarm the siege.

From the Sword Qi Great Wall, a torrent of flying swords cascaded southward.

This time, the Wildlands would also unleash a river of comparable might, formed from countless spirit tools and magical treasures, with radiant brilliance soaring to the heavens, advancing toward the northern city wall.

You have your Sword Qi Great River, and I have my treasure river.

It would be a direct collision of rivers.

Since they had already decided to exhaust half the strength of their realm to attack this lonely Sword Qi Great Wall, how could they not have some decent display?

Using spirit tools and magical treasures in exchange for natal flying swords, they would see who felt the pinch more.

There were no plots or schemes, no clever layouts, just a mutual consumption of their resources.

If the earlier Huang Luan had been slightly more capable, not so utterly useless, able to hold the five mountain peaks firmly as a base, the damage to the Sword Qi Great Wall would have been even greater.

However, who would have thought that Li Tui Mi and the Left's strikes would disrupt the entire arrangement? Not only did they fail to kill more Ascension stage sword immortals, but they also almost lost everything in return. This also significantly affected Huang Luan’s siege, as otherwise, if the battlefield had been a bit closer to the city walls, the enemy would have suffered casualties much faster, and the Sword Qi Great Wall’s natal flying swords would have suffered losses as well.

Five Mountain Lords of the Ascension stage and thousands of talisman practitioners sacrificed their lives to refine the mountains, then had the heavy light transported to the battlefield. The accounts in the military tent were meticulously recorded.

If not for the Hidden Official’s defection, it would have created a huge problem; after all, the current siege was no longer as crude as before; they began to calculate carefully. Those military tents were not mere decorations; the cultivators within, even if their cultivation levels were not high and included many young children, were viewed seriously by the great ancestors and Mount Tuo Yue. Any military order that left the military tent had to be weighed by someone like Huang Luan, as well as the existing powers like Yang Zhi and Bai Ying.

Huang Luan raised his hand high and lightly waved it forward.

The demon army unleashed their treasures.

In the night, it seemed as if a brilliant galaxy suddenly hung in the sky.

Even a long-standing ancient existence like the great demon Huang Luan had to admit that this scene was spectacular and refreshing, though he wondered if he would have the opportunity to see such a sight again in the future. Once he reached the Hao Ran realm, based on previous calculations, it seemed unlikely he would have such a chance.

Huang Luan exclaimed, opening the barriers with a smile, “A rare guest, indeed!”

It was Yang Zhi, who had suffered significant losses to his celestial armor and law robes. Despite being broken and battered in battle, he had gathered most of the fragments to present to this nostalgic lady. However, if he truly wanted to repair it, it would be troublesome and not worth it; instead, it would be better to go to the Hao Ran realm and seize a few more items.

Today, dressed in simple clothes, the woman known as Yang Zhi sat beside the railing, her expression gloomy.

Huang Luan laughed, “What’s the matter? Are you trying to steal my credit?”

Yang Zhi replied, “I’m just helping you earn some credit. The great ancestor hasn’t said anything serious, but it’s clear he’s not too happy. After this battle, I’ll have to return to the Wildlands to personally hunt down those sword immortals who are wandering about.”

Huang Luan glanced toward the Sword Qi Great Wall, feeling regret. To be honest, even he had been kept in the dark about the Hidden Official’s betrayal. He had not anticipated such a change in events.

Yang Zhi asked, “What about the northern city? What is the timing for our pieces to strike?”

Huang Luan laughed, “How would I know such things?”

The army beneath them was not stationary; they were continuously advancing, casting various chaotic natal items from afar.

The torrent of sword energy clashed with the treasure river, a dazzling spectacle, like ancient deities forging swords, with countless sparks erupting, splashing everywhere like falling fire rain, illuminating both the Sword Qi Great Wall and Huang Luan’s celestial city, making them shine brilliantly.

In addition to this, there were the ants rushing madly on both flanks of the army, not just for show but genuinely sacrificing their lives to fill the battlefield. This was the “helping hands” Yang Zhi had mentioned, for these ants were the vassal forces and main troops of Yang Zhi. A peak great demon responsible for minor achievements in exchange for major errors would not merely be sitting beside Huang Luan enjoying the scenery, nor would he just take a few swings at the torrent of sword energy; many of these ants would die, directly thinning out some of the old powers they had worked hard to build up.

The Wildlands had one of the best aspects.

Under the fist, they had to accept fate obediently.

If they were unwilling to die, they would die first.

Moreover, it was not solely about dying; many military records would meticulously document every battlefield’s losses and achievements. Dying wasn’t too much of a loss, and if they survived, they would reap rewards many times over. The vastness of the Hao Ran realm meant that once they passed the Sword Qi Great Wall, they would have ample opportunities to make money. Countless heavenly materials and earthly treasures awaited the Wildlands to seize.

Huang Luan suddenly smiled playfully, “When did the Sword Qi Great Wall’s sword immortals become so orderly when drawing swords?”

This handsome man, full of the aura of an immortal, lightly tapped the railing, lamenting, “It’s over! With this, the enemy’s losses are bound to fall below the military tent’s expectations. Yang Zhi, is your bad luck so heavy that it drags me down? Look, those Yuesheng, Mi Hu, and the others, who were said to have poor relationships, all seem to be very meticulous about their formations now. Those rebellious sword immortals are engaging in small-scale fights, seamlessly coordinating with one another. But this scene tonight allows nearly all sword immortals to maximize their natal divine abilities. Isn’t that both surprising and troubling for you and me?”

Yang Zhi’s face darkened as he coldly laughed, “Knowing they are doomed, they resist stubbornly.”

After observing for a moment, Huang Luan sighed, “To gather the battle lines and have the sword cultivators retreat three li? Is this still the Sword Qi Great Wall I’ve heard of?”

Yang Zhi puzzled, “If it’s troublesome, then why are you still watching?”

Huang Luan smiled, “Let those young folks in the military tent practice a bit more. It’s all a show for the back row anyway. Besides, I don’t think this battlefield will suffer too badly. In the future, if we want to stalemate with the Hao Ran realm, we can’t rely solely on a few of us.”

Yang Zhi turned to look toward a distant place where a larger battle formation was yet to reach the battlefield.

They were all local sword cultivators of the Wildlands!

No matter how precious the lives of sword cultivators were, they couldn’t just be kept as decorations.

Those who could question the Sword Qi Great Wall and use it as a whetstone to sharpen their swords, while surviving, were the true sword cultivators.

At the Sword Qi Great Wall, a rather bizarre small hill had been hastily assembled, and over ten people, about half of whom were outsiders, gathered there.

Thus, the latest sword cultivators from the Hidden Official’s faction converged here, marking the first time in history that the Hidden Official’s faction had recruited foreign sword cultivators.

As for the roles of supervising officer and record keeper, they were still entrusted to the previous sword cultivators of the Hidden Official’s faction and the Confucian disciples, but the identities of the former Hidden Official’s faction members had already been lost.

After gathering these people, Lu Zhi quickly left, leaving behind two scrolls sent by the Taoist saints.

The two large scrolls were unfurled by Lu Zhi along the promenade. One scroll depicted the scene of the sword energy torrent clashing with the treasure river. The other, further south of the battlefield, illustrated the layout of the demon army's formation in the Wildlands, albeit a bit unclear; yet, the more northward it went, the clearer the details appeared, as if there was a watershed split by time and opportunity.

Lu Zhi only said that everyone temporarily need not bear the responsibility of drawing swords to kill enemies, as they were all regarded as part of the Hidden Official’s faction. Beyond that, this remarkable female sword immortal with exceptional combat capabilities did not utter another word.

Most sword cultivators exchanged glances, unsure of what to do.

Firstly, many did not know each other, and secondly, they were completely lost about what was expected of them.

Mi Yu felt the most awkward, as he was the only one at the Ascension stage.

They couldn’t just stare blankly at each other, so the highest-ranked Mi Yu said, “Let’s introduce ourselves first. I’m Mi Yu, a Yu Pu realm sword cultivator.”

A handsome young man in white smiled and said, “Lin Junbi, from the Central Continent, just entered the Dragon Gate realm.”

One after another, people began to introduce themselves.

“Deng Liang from the White Snow Continent, Yuanying realm.”

“Song Gaoyuan from Fu Yao Continent, Jindan realm.”

“Cao Jun from Liu Xia Continent, Dragon Gate realm.”

“Xuan Can from Jin Jia Continent, Jindan realm.”

In addition, from the Sword Qi Great Wall, there were Pang Yuanji, Dong Buduo, Situ Weiran, Gu Jianlong, Wang Xinshui, Guo Zhu Jiu, and Chen Ping’an.

The happiest was Guo Zhu Jiu, because her master was also present.

She squatted beside her master, both big and small keeping their sleeves tucked, clearly showing they were family.

The most anxious was, of course, Gu Jianlong.

After her master introduced himself, Guo Zhu Jiu began to clap vigorously.

“Chen Ping’an, lower fifth realm.”

Chen Ping’an turned to smile at his disciple, “Steady.”

Guo Zhu Jiu nodded vigorously.

Lin Junbi said, “Even if this group of demon beasts retreats, there will definitely be another group of sword cultivators coming to question us. This is probably why we’ve gathered here—to think of as many possibilities about the enemy as we can, and to strategize our responses. The situation is extremely urgent; aside from Sword Immortal Mi, our cultivation levels are not high, so our responsibility is actually to plug gaps. We can’t help much, but if we brainstorm together, we should be able to contribute a little.”

While Lin Junbi spoke, Chen Ping’an sat cross-legged on the edge of the scroll, holding his folding fan, lightly tapping his palm, and gazing intently at the battlefield depicted on the scroll.

Lin Junbi looked toward Mi Yu, who nodded in agreement, though he felt a bit awkward all over.

Lin Junbi then turned his attention to the second-in-command.

Chen Ping’an did not lift his head, smiling, “Let those capable take on more work; Junbi can issue commands.”

Lin Junbi felt a bit out of place. 

However, he did not hesitate; recognizing the priorities, Lin Junbi, at this moment, felt as though standing at the side of a chessboard, competing against the entire Wildlands. Helping the Sword Qi Great Wall gain even a slight advantage was also a victory for himself and the Shao Yuan Dynasty.

Thus, without hesitation, after a moment of contemplation, Lin Junbi began to assign tasks to everyone.

He tasked Pang Yuanji and Dong Buduo with counting and categorizing all the natal flying swords and divine abilities of their own sword immortals, while Situ Weiran and Deng Liang would record the semi-immortal weapons and key magical treasures of the enemy cultivators. Xuan Can and Song Gaoyuan were responsible for keeping track of the consumption of both sides' flying swords and magical treasures, while Cao Jun and Wang Xinshui would monitor the changes in the demon cultivators’ formations, and if they had the bandwidth, to look for any hidden high-level enemies...

Chen Ping’an looked toward Gu Jianlong and greeted, “Gu, what a coincidence; where in life do we not meet again?”

Gu Jianlong hurried over to Chen Ping’an, squatting down, full of righteousness, “What are you joking about? How could I let the second-in-command call me ‘Gu brother’? Just call me Xiao Gu!”

On this side of the promenade of the wall, a series of low tables finally appeared, with everyone sitting cross-legged. Mi Hu needed to compile the documents he had been recording and then hand them over to Guo Zhu Jiu for distribution, so everyone could read and share information.

As for some crucial intelligence, given how close they were, they could simply speak directly.

Only Chen Ping’an had no substantial task.

The reason was simple: after Lu Zhi sent people to bring tables and writing materials, she stated one line.

“From this moment on, Chen Ping’an is the new Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Mi Hu felt rather helpless.

Pang Yuanji felt relieved. As long as it wasn’t himself succeeding the Hidden Official, anyone else would be fine, and this second-in-command was the best of all.

Lin Junbi’s expression was complex, fleeting. He increasingly suspected that the current transformations in the sword immortals’ formations were indeed due to this man’s suggestions.

Gu Jianlong, on the other hand, was smiling despite himself.

Guo Zhu Jiu applauded alone, her applause echoing like thunder.

The youngest and lowest-ranked Hidden Official in the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall stood up, took the ancient jade tablet symbolizing the Hidden Official's identity, shook his sleeves, and sat back down, hanging the jade tablet at his waist, alongside the Sword Cultivation Gourd.

On the desk, aside from the writing materials, there were stacks of blank ledgers waiting to be filled, as well as a folded jade bamboo fan resting there.

Chen Ping’an interlocked his fingers, gazing at the familiar arrangement on the table, smiling faintly. It felt great, as if he were already seated in his small world without even unleashing his natal flying sword.

What new Hidden Official? 

It was merely a transition from a harmless burden to a more adept accountant.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 737: Settling Accounts with the Entire World (1)

In the wild and untamed world, it was still unclear that atop the Sword Qi Great Wall, they were missing one of the most powerful Hidden Officials in history, while simultaneously welcoming a new Hidden Official with the lowest cultivation level ever recorded.

Even if they were aware of this, it would likely be treated as a grand joke.

In fact, even among those at the Sword Qi Great Wall, there weren’t many who took it seriously. Especially the Sword Immortals, who merely regarded it as another “whatever” move from the big boss Sword Immortal.

With the new official taking office, Chen Ping’an immediately set about his tasks, accomplishing three things in total.

The Hidden Official lineage owned two private residences outside the city—one for summer retreats and one for winter. All the secret files accumulated over a century were moved to the corridor, stacked high behind Chen Ping’an, forming a mountain of documents.

The previous Hidden Official had neither taken the jade tablet inscribed with the ancient characters for “Hidden Official” nor destroyed the archives that held the lineage's legacy spanning thousands of years.

Aside from the “mountain” behind Chen Ping’an, he also had a treasured artifact moved over—a sword room.

Two flying swords were specially forged by the sword workshop for the Hidden Official lineage’s sword cultivators. At Chen Ping’an’s request, the swordsmiths engraved each person’s name on them.

Chen Ping’an, Mi Yu, Pang Yuanji, Dong Buduo, Gu Jianlong, Wang Xinshui, Guo Zhujiao, Lin Junbi, Deng Liang, Song Gaoyuan, Cao Jun, and Xuan Can.

These were all the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

However, the two flying swords belonging to Chen Ping’an were inscribed with the characters for “Hidden Official” instead of his name.

The third thing he did was to speak plainly to his “subordinate” sword cultivators, delivering a straightforward message, “Everyone, including myself, we are a total of twelve sword cultivators present here. We’re all quite intelligent and should understand something—our common point is that our cultivation levels are not high, and our sword techniques are negligible in the current offense and defense battles. However, our minds are functioning well. When we encounter issues, we’re willing to think a bit deeper. It has become second nature for us. While the average sword cultivator might think something through once, we may have already considered it several times. This is what we call practice makes perfect. Granting the title of Hidden Official to each of you is the utmost recognition, but this is not a guaranteed position. Every suggestion we make, especially those that ultimately affect the strategies of the sword formations, will involve the lives of countless sword cultivators—potentially thousands or even the lives of many Sword Immortals. My only requirement is that everyone must put in their utmost effort. If I find anyone lagging at any stage, whose mind seems sharp but is actually lacking, I will directly expel them from the Hidden Official lineage. No matter how valuable your face may be, it cannot compare to the lives of sword cultivators or their life-bound flying swords.”

“So, this is definitely not a light matter. Please prepare yourselves mentally; we need to be responsible for every fallen warrior. The greater challenge lies with those sword cultivators whose lives are worse than death, or those who have lost family and friends in battle. They might harbor resentment towards the twelve of us—towards us sword cultivators who only seem to talk. It’s only natural for them to hate us, and we cannot change that. However, we must not lose hope; not even a little. If anyone bears grudges and intentionally sabotages us, once I discover it, I will have Sword Immortal Mi Yu deliver a sword strike to kill them. I will not listen to any excuses. The moment I suspect someone, that person will die. So, I have one final question: who wants to withdraw from the Hidden Official lineage? Now is the time to back out. Otherwise, instead of scheming against me, Chen Ping’an, and competing in cunning, it’s better to go out there and kill demons, earning some merit—it’s definitely better than wasting time here.”

The other eleven sword cultivators were silent, their expressions resolute.

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Good. Even Lin Junbi, this promising young sword cultivator, hasn’t hesitated to stake his life and future here. I believe we can trust in our unity.”

Lin Junbi suddenly felt a prick of anxiety.

Was Chen Ping’an going to take this opportunity to settle personal scores?

Chen Ping’an narrowed his eyes, surveying the faces of the sword cultivators, and slowly continued, “We are no longer here to cultivate or forge swords; we are to represent the Sword Qi Great Wall and conduct the largest transaction with the beasts of the wild world beneath Heaven. We need to make a deal that will save the lives of as many of our sword cultivators as possible, while costing the enemy as many lives as possible! Everyone, such an opportunity will never come again in our lives. No matter how rich your fortune may be in the future, how high you climb the path to the great Dao, or how you transcend to become an immortal, or reincarnate in the next life, you will never encounter such an opportunity again. Even if you become the leader of a sect in the righteous world, commanding countless sword cultivators, how many Sword Immortals will willingly risk their lives at your command?! You must cherish this moment, for this is a feat that only the twelve of us can accomplish in this world, both past and future!”

Guo Zhujiao, sitting behind the desk, had a resolute expression, suddenly clasping his fists but saying nothing.

Dong Buduo followed suit, equally spirited, raising his fists high.

All the others, including Lin Junbi, Gu Jianlong, Wang Xinshui, and even Sword Immortal Mi Yu, clasped their fists one by one.

Especially the younger sword cultivators from distant lands were even more invigorated. 

Those who dared to come to the Sword Qi Great Wall to practice their swordplay, especially those who refused to leave after the great battle, had pure and lofty ambitions!

Chen Ping’an said, “Don’t rush to issue orders to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Let’s first familiarize ourselves with the battlefield. Follow Lin Junbi’s established plan and carry out your duties. In half an hour, I will make another decision.”

To Chen Ping’an, Lin Junbi’s plan was too crude, but it was the product of his quick thinking and could not be overly criticized. However, after half an hour, or rather, from then on, the Sword Qi Great Wall would respond in this way to the strategic cooperation against the wild world’s sixty military camps, and Chen Ping’an did not feel that his Hidden Official lineage had any chance of winning.

Chen Ping’an began to flip through the old secret documents of the Hidden Official lineage, reading quickly. There were more than ten blank books beside him; when he found key points, he would jot down notes. At the same time, he occasionally glanced at the battlefield scroll and observed the subtle changes in the expressions of the eleven people.

The elegant handwriting belonged to the Bamboo Hut Sword Immortal.

The sharp strokes were by the female Sword Immortal, Luo Shan.

What a meeting of minds through words.

The content was clear and concise, without any faults to be found.

Even though three Sword Immortals had defected from the Sword Qi Great Wall, regarding this archival record, it could still be said that they had acted diligently.

Exactly half an hour later, Chen Ping’an, holding a closed folding fan, did not open it but lightly raised it before giving the table a firm knock, saying, “Continue to keep an eye on the battlefield; listen to my words without distraction. From now on, everyone must focus on three things: the first is your primary duties; everyone must keep a firm watch on the scroll. The second is that everyone must start taking notes for the convenience of others. When someone needs it, they can directly request it from others as a reference. The third matter is transmitting messages with flying swords at certain moments.”

Chen Ping’an continued, “Let’s start with the third matter. The flying swords from the Hidden Official lineage’s sword workshop are incredibly fast. Aside from major strategies, which I will personally communicate to all sword cultivators via flying swords, for other minor adjustments to the sword formations, you each have your tasks. Mi Yu, Dong Buduo, and Gu Jianlong will be responsible for transmitting messages to all local sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, dividing the Great Wall into three major territories: left, center, and right. Guo Zhujiao and Wang Xinshui will handle all notifications to the upper five realms’ Sword Immortals.”

Upon hearing this, Mi Yu frowned. This seemed unreasonable; logically, he should be the one contacting the other Sword Immortals.

Chen Ping’an explained, “Sword Immortal Mi Yu, if a Sword Immortal talks to another Sword Immortal, the disparity in cultivation levels creates a mental threshold. It’s not pure, and it can lead to complications. Opportunities on the battlefield are fleeting; hesitation can cause everything to be lost. Do you understand?”

Mi Yu nodded.

In fact, this Hidden Official was being quite polite; there were even more underlying reasons he didn’t mention, such as Mi Yu’s poor reputation among the other Sword Immortals at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

In contrast, the lower-cultivation Guo Zhujiao and Wang Xinshui, as flying sword messengers, would be much more straightforward and businesslike. If Mi Yu, known for his flashy reputation, were to issue commands, many Sword Immortals would simply not take him seriously.

Chen Ping’an continued, “If you have such doubts in the future, feel free to ask me directly. If you can persuade me to change my mind, that would be best. Additionally, Pang Yuanji will be responsible for contacting the old Hidden Official lineage’s overseers and military merit recorders from the Confucian School. Since their numbers are few, Pang Yuanji will also be in charge of a sword cultivator from the Central Plains. Lin Junbi will cover the sword cultivators from the Southern Poso Continent, Deng Liang will contact all sword cultivators from the Northern Julu Continent, Song Gaoyuan will transmit messages to the Golden Armor Continent, Xuan Can will be in charge of the Flowing Clouds Continent, and Cao Jun will handle the White Ice Continent.”

Many of these newly appointed Hidden Official lineage sword cultivators were skilled in mental calculations and strategies, proficient in games of chess; Lin Junbi and Xuan Can were both true masters.

Mi Yu truly had questions and asked the Hidden Official directly, “Why not have each continent’s sword cultivators contact their own Sword Immortals? Wouldn’t that be less likely to cause hesitation?”

Chen Ping’an countered, “Deng Liang and the other foreign sword cultivators came to the Sword Qi Great Wall, putting their lives on the line. Now they’re being pulled in to serve as Hidden Official lineage sword cultivators while doing this thankless job, and they shouldn’t be denied the opportunity to earn some goodwill.”

His words were direct.

He laid it out plainly as a business deal.

Lin Junbi smiled knowingly.

The other foreign sword cultivators felt a bit embarrassed, but more importantly, they were grateful, feeling a deeper appreciation for this Hidden Official.

If they could live, who would wish to die? If they could survive and live with a clear conscience, then thinking more about the future path to greatness was only natural.

Mi Yu pondered for a moment, understanding the connections, and helplessly smiled, awkwardly clasping his fists, indicating his understanding and raising no further questions.

The local sword cultivators were responsible for communicating with their own local sword cultivators. However, for the foreign sword cultivators like Lin Junbi, the flying sword communications had hidden nuances and significance. For instance, Lin Junbi would transmit messages to the southern Poso Continent, while the northernmost Aiai Continent’s sword cultivator Deng Liang would cover the northeastern Julu Continent; the other sword cultivators followed suit, all sending flying swords to neighboring continents.

This kind of goodwill was like the ferryboats crossing continents, where the ferry operators made no profit but engaged in the most just business. Such sincere goodwill would naturally last long, allowing for lasting thoughts of each other. As for the local sword cultivators regarding the young sword cultivators who had joined the Hidden Official lineage, they already held them in high regard, so there was no need for Hidden Official Chen Ping’an to go out of his way to make things even better for Deng Liang and Xuan Can.

Lin Junbi was the first to think of it, and the other young foreign sword cultivators quickly realized it. After all, being selected by the Sword Qi Great Wall to become part of the Hidden Official lineage meant, as Chen Ping’an said, while their cultivation levels might not be high, none of them lacked sharp minds.

Thus, there truly was only one who needed to inquire—Mi Yu, the highest in cultivation.

Chen Ping’an picked up a stack of books, over ten in total, all titled simply “Volume A Main Book” and “Volume A Supplementary Book,” and explained, “The next matter is of utmost importance. Listen carefully.”

Chen Ping’an held up the top two books, explaining, “These two books record in detail the names of our sword cultivators in the upper five realms, their life-bound flying swords, and the unique abilities of those flying swords. The main book lists the Sword Immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall, while the supplementary book lists foreign Sword Immortals. Each page records one individual, and the page number will be indicated in the lower right corner. You all must memorize the page numbers and corresponding Sword Immortals thoroughly.”

Then, Chen Ping’an set down these two books and explained the functions of the other books.

The secondary book was responsible for recording all the wild beasts’ upper five realms that had appeared on the battlefield.

On both sides, the main book recorded all the great beasts in the Hall of Heroic Spirits that possessed fourteen thrones, as well as all ascendant and immortal beasts, including those who were sword cultivators at the Yu Pu realm.

The supplementary book recorded all beasts at the Yu Pu realm, excluding sword cultivators.

If names were unknown, then they could arbitrarily assign a name, describing the appearance after transformation, their true forms, key magical treasures, life-bound abilities, and the general faction they belonged to in the wild world, as well as details on who they fought alongside—the more details, the better.

The third book had no supplementary volume.

It recorded all local Earth Immortal sword cultivators, with special emphasis on selecting those whose life-bound flying swords were particularly suited for the battlefield, considering how to pair them in a way that could create effects similar to that of the Earth Immortal couple’s “Drawing the Dragon with a Touch.”

Chen Ping’an also cited several examples, such as the Yuanying sword cultivator Cheng Quan, and the special Earth Immortal sword cultivator Wu Chengpei, who must be treated with special care.

The fourth book recorded the same level of Earth Immortal beasts.

While explaining this last book, Chen Ping’an’s tone was particularly heavy, stating that it was singled out because these beasts from the wild world were the most deserving of death, and they were relatively easier to kill compared to the great beasts. In the past, they had often been overlooked by the Sword Qi Great Wall, either not being taken seriously enough, or due to the need to focus on battles between top-tier forces, leaving them unable to divert their attention. However, once the calculations were made, the killing power of these beasts might not have been apparent at any given moment, but if one were to review the entire course of the war, the longer the battle dragged on, these beasts became a central force causing severe damage to the Sword Qi Great Wall, perhaps even more frightening than certain upper five realms beasts.

In Chen Ping’an’s words, killing these beasts was the most cost-effective. The Sword Immortal seniors wouldn’t need to exert too much effort, yet they could still reap considerable military merit—every bit adds up, and not killing them would be a waste.

Chen Ping’an clearly valued this “fourth book” greatly, holding it for a long time and reluctant to set it down, saying solemnly, “So if we can draft a relatively detailed framework for this fourth book, relying on its incredibly detailed specifics to deduce facts as close to the truth as possible, then we can reopen the main and supplementary books to seek out those Sword Immortal seniors who possess great killing power and strike quickly on the battlefield, to find opportunities to slay the beast cultivators recorded in this book. This, at present, is the most immediate action for our Hidden Official lineage, so I urge you all to consider this carefully. Each name we strike through from the fourth book represents the most tangible military merit for everyone present!”

Xuan Can asked, “What if the senior Sword Immortals have their own reasons and don’t wish to engage in battle? Even after our flying sword messages, it would be useless—what then? On the battlefield, both sides have longstanding grievances. If, for example, one of our Sword Immortals becomes fixated on revenge, insisting on facing their enemy, unwilling to heed our commands, are we to have internal strife?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “If someone is too proud to move or refuses to leave their post under some pretext, or if what you said were to happen, Xuan Can, you can invoke the identity of a Hidden Official lineage sword cultivator. This is a military order. If that doesn’t work, after two reminders via flying swords, we won’t waste any more words. I will personally seek out Sword Immortals with even greater authority and killing power to request their engagement. If they refuse, then we will simply pursue them!”

The atmosphere grew a bit heavy.

This young Hidden Official was joking, but in truth, this was far from an easy task.

The defection of the previous Hidden Official and the followings of two Sword Immortals, especially the injuries sustained by those on either side, had left the morale at the Sword Qi Great Wall visibly low. Another unexpected incident would undoubtedly add fuel to the fire.

Chen Ping’an set down the book, smiling, “What are you all looking at me for? A Hidden Official of such stature personally running errands and calling out orders—how embarrassing. My own shame is trivial, but I cannot bear to tarnish your reputations. Right, Brother Gu? Isn’t that a fair statement?”

Gu Jianlong nodded vigorously.

Chen Ping’an’s smile faded, “You all probably don’t yet fully grasp the weight of the term ‘Hidden Official lineage.’ Here at the Sword Qi Great Wall, these four characters can determine life and death without needing to reason!”

Chen Ping’an continued, “If you harbor doubts in your hearts, it’s no problem; just wait and see. I’m not afraid to wager the head of a Sword Immortal to prove the truth of this matter. As for all of you, why worry? If the sky falls, just say that our Hidden Official lineage’s twelve members will naturally bear the brunt of it.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 738: Settling Accounts Across the World (Part Two)

Chen Ping'an picked up the latest blank ledger, the "Wu Ben," which followed immediately after the "Ding Ben."

The Wu Ben recorded the strategies for sieges in the previous three battles, detailing every aspect meticulously. It included troop distributions, the sixty small battlefields of the barbaric world, the speed of troop redeployments, and whether the siege style remained steady or was frequently adaptable—everything was to be documented.

As a result, this ledger was bound to be thick and heavy, and its content would constantly be supplemented, growing denser by the day.

Next was the Ji Ben. 

This ledger would chronicle all the merits and demerits of the twelve sword cultivators from the Hidden Official lineage in minute detail. 

This was a record of achievements, as well as a book for self-reflection.

The sole author was, of course, the newly appointed Hidden Official, Chen Ping'an. However, only Chen Ping'an had the privilege to peruse it.

Then came the Geng Ben.

This was intended to record the names of all sword cultivators who died in battle or lost their life swords. 

It was destined to be another hefty tome.

Deng Liang asked, “Should we record the sword cultivators who died or lost their swords in the previous two battles right away?”

Chen Ping'an replied straightforwardly, “No need. We can add that later. This one should only be written when we have the time.”

The living were always more important than the dead.

Such was the nature of war.

Deng Liang nodded, showing no dissent, and secretly let out a sigh of relief. 

If Chen Ping'an had answered incorrectly regarding this matter, then the hearts of all the sword cultivators, including Deng Liang himself, would have scattered like ashes.

Everyone was quite intelligent; whether as the new Hidden Official or as the second shopkeeper under the identity of a disciple of the Confucian Sage, if Chen Ping'an could not manage to suppress them and earn their respect in this "small world," then leaving aside other matters, the Ji Ben would become a huge joke. Given that the Hidden Official lineage had just begun to take shape, it would only serve as a burden rather than a benefit.

In this small world, only those with the strongest hearts could command reason.

There was an ancient saying at the Sword Qi Great Wall that seemed quite ridiculous but was, in reality, extremely cruel.

Sword cultivators from the lower five realms would often boast, “I’m better than Zong Yuan.”

It was important to note that this old sword immortal had fought alongside Chen Qingdu for the longest time after Long Jun and Guan Zhao, holding the highest status and was reputed to be the one most likely to break through the “great bottleneck” of ascendant sword cultivators.

During the brutal battle where the demon army flooded the city, it was he alone who wielded his sword to slay two ascendant demons, and with Chen Qingdu's help, they managed to repel the barbaric forces.

According to military merit, Zong Yuan could certainly have his name inscribed, and it would only take two characters. However, being dead meant he could no longer have two characters carved into the Sword Qi Great Wall.

A dead old sword immortal, a great sword immortal, could hardly be seen as formidable if he could not even wield his sword anymore. Not at all.

Chen Ping'an set the blank ledger down.

Geng, then, autumn harvest awaiting the spring.

It was initially a phrase filled with hopeful meaning but had turned into a grand delusion.

Chen Ping'an continued discussing the Xin Ben, the Ren Ben, and finally the Gui Ben.

The Xin Ben.

This would tally the battle losses in the barbaric world.

The Ren Ben.

This would account for all the assets of the Sword Qi Great Wall, including the sword workshop, clothing workshop, and alchemy workshop, with a particular focus on coordinating with the Nalan and Yan families responsible for trade at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

In a war, aside from the consumption of both sides' forces, it was also a battle over the intangible foundations, celestial coins, and precious materials.

The Gui Ben.

In every battlefield, the twelve members of the Hidden Official lineage could evaluate, deduce, and speculate on the next offensive and defensive battles, freely expressing their thoughts and insights, writing them down at any time to be submitted to Guo Zhujiu, who would compile them for Chen Ping'an.

After placing all the ledgers in order, Chen Ping'an said, “Having discussed the second and third matters, it’s time to address the first. The previous division of responsibilities for Lin Junbi was not an issue before, but given the current situation, we will make some changes. This is also a key principle for our Hidden Official lineage going forward. We can no longer approach battles with the same unchanging strategies as before; we must adapt at all times. Every change must yield the best results through our collective wisdom. Every time we send a message via flying sword, it must benefit the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall!”

Chen Ping'an meticulously delineated the detailed responsibilities of the twelve individuals and emphasized that each sword cultivator must keep an eye on the overall trend of the battlefield, never focusing solely on their small patch of land. To not demand such from the twelve would easily lead to small gains at the cost of significant losses on a larger scale, resulting in a seemingly bizarre yet undeniable account within the Hidden Official lineage—one that would come at the greater cost of unnecessary deaths among hundreds of sword cultivators.

“Heroes slay the enemy, all within the pen.”

Chen Ping'an finally smiled, bending down to pick up a folding fan, opening the jade bamboo fan with a grin, and said cheerfully, “Now, I invite you all to join me in calculating the barbaric world. What skill is there in merely making money? If we’re to earn, let’s earn those heads of great demons!”

Only at this moment did Lin Junbi truly feel admiration for Chen Ping'an.

He truly was the esteemed teacher in name of that Mr. Cui.

A legacy passed down, with achievements to the utmost!

Chen Ping'an closed the fan and smiled at Pang Yuanji, calling him by name, “Pang Yuanji, remember to write on the Yi Ben that ‘Xiao Xian, also known as Zhengyun, a bottleneck sword cultivator of the ascendant realm, with an unclear life sword’—make sure this does not end up in the Jia Ben. If you have any leads on this person's life sword, you can certainly add that in the book, just for reference. I can then record a merit for you in the Ji Ben.”

Pang Yuanji's face turned pale as he nodded silently.

The previous Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall was named Xiao Xian.

This was a name many young sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall had long forgotten.

They had grown accustomed to referring to her simply as the Hidden Official.

Chen Ping'an narrowed his eyes and asked, “You nodded but said nothing. Forgive my dullness; I cannot tell whether you know anything about this person’s life sword.”

Pang Yuanji shook his head, “I do not know.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “It’s fine. The great war is prolonged, and that person should not act for now. If you happen to forget and later remember, there will still be a merit to be had.”

Their exchange left Sword Immortal Mi Yu, along with the other sword cultivators who had initially kept their distance, feeling a chill run down their spines.

Chen Ping'an looked around, lightly shaking the folding fan, his hair fluttering, “I already know your names, origins, and realms. However, I have an unusual request: please tell me your greatest strengths and weaknesses. This is a small matter; everyone should focus on their important tasks first. When I ask, just share your thoughts with me. I hope you all can be open and honest; this matter is no trifling matter.”

Lin Junbi was somewhat puzzled.

Chen Ping'an's actions certainly weren’t a likable gesture.

However, Lin Junbi quickly understood.

Chen Ping'an needed to grasp the hearts of all members of the Hidden Official lineage as quickly as possible.

If the standoff between the Sword Qi Great Wall and the barbaric world was the largest battlefield, then the Hidden Official lineage and all the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall would be the second. Within the Hidden Official lineage itself, the twelve individuals formed the third battlefield. And seemingly the smallest battlefield—where hearts fluctuated—was significantly impactful; any ripple of intention could greatly affect the dynamics of the first two battlefields due to the weight of their positions.

As the Hidden Official, Chen Ping'an could certainly rely on the subsequent actions of the twelve to gauge their character traits little by little. However, that would be too slow; a delay in strategy for the Hidden Official lineage would lead to a lag in battlefield responses. But with this measure in place, regardless of how the twelve answered, it would serve as a proof, allowing the meticulous Chen Ping'an to make further judgments.

After a moment, everyone provided their answers. Chen Ping'an remained impassive, choosing not to record them directly in the Ji Ben but instead wrote them on a piece of paper, which he tucked into the Ji Ben.

Yu Jianfu approached, pausing for a moment before asking, “Can I help?”

No one turned to look at the noblewoman from the Central Land, and even Lin Junbi dared only to glance slightly, keeping an eye on this potentially significant inquiry.

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “No.”

Yu Jianfu didn’t linger and quietly moved to a distant, secluded spot on the wall to sit alone and drink.

Chen Ping'an turned to Mi Yu, “Sword Immortal Mi Yu, I need you to outline a sword formation within a three-mile radius to serve as a restricted area. Then, recruit a group of young sword cultivators. Their realms can be low, even from the lower five realms; three to five will suffice. Their only responsibility is to inform all passing sword cultivators of the new regulations here. All extraneous personnel are not allowed to come close, and sword immortals are no exception.”

At this point, Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “Sword Immortal Mi Yu, you have the highest realm among us, so you will have to take on the role of the villain. If any conflict arises, just draw your sword; if you can’t handle it, I’ll personally reason with the sword immortals.”

Mi Yu felt slightly reassured and accepted the order, rising to carry out the task.

The rules of the Hidden Official lineage, whether previously slack or strictly adhered to, would only become more unyielding under Chen Ping'an's leadership. It was certain that the Sword Qi Great Wall would soon learn this.

Chen Ping'an closed the folding fan gently, placed it on the table, and then removed the jade token labeled "Hidden Official," placing it beside the fan. He then began drafting the primary and secondary volumes of the Jia Ben, a series of names already clear in his mind, allowing him to write quickly.

Named after the Tian Gan, he designated both the Jia Ben and Yi Ben with their respective secondary volumes.

Perfectly, there were twelve volumes.

Now, the Hidden Official lineage also amounted to exactly twelve individuals.

Chen Ping'an hoped that after the great war, everyone could each take away a volume.

If they were all still alive, that is.

Suddenly, Xuan Can spoke solemnly, “Great Sword Immortal Yue Qing is currently wielding tremendous sword energy, but it’s affecting the overall sword formation. The nearby two sword immortals can only follow suit. Although the cooperation within the small range of sword immortals is evident, several earth immortals and other mid-five-realm sword cultivators are significantly slowed in their strikes, resulting in greater losses of their life swords.”

Soon, two other sword cultivators nodded, each affirming, “Indeed.” “That’s true.”

Chen Ping'an cast a glance at the drawing and continued to focus on writing in the Jia Ben, saying nonchalantly, “Flying sword message to Yue Qing.”

Wang Xinshui quickly sensed the urgency and controlled a flying sword to concisely explain the situation, glancing at the defense map each sword immortal held. The flying sword vanished in an instant, heading toward Great Sword Immortal Yue Qing, and the young sword cultivator began to sweat nervously, ultimately feeling apprehensive. Although Wang Xinshui was one of the talented sword cultivators in the Sword Qi Great Wall's history, commanding a peak sword immortal was akin to instructing them on how to wield their sword; how could he feel at ease?

In a moment, Chen Ping'an lifted his head while continuing to write, his gaze sharp as he said, “Wang Xinshui, send another flying sword message to Yue Qing. Don’t bother with reasoning; directly tell him that if he doesn’t change his sword, he should roll off the city wall. Before leaving the wall, remember to complain to the old sword immortal!”

Wang Xinshui trembled as he sent the second flying sword message.

Not only that, but Chen Ping'an also seemed to remember something, cursing under his breath, and directly used his own flying sword to send a message to the old sword immortal.

Then, he instructed Guo Zhujiu to send a flying sword message to the jade purity realm sword immortal Wu Chengpei, inquiring about the progress of refining the “Sweet Rain” sword, and then said to everyone, “These matters are your responsibilities; I don’t want to remind you a second time.”

Moments later, not only did Great Sword Immortal Yue Qing retract his sword slightly, but this restricted area also welcomed an unexpected guest.

It seemed that Chen Ping'an's flying sword message had led the old sword immortal to personally issue orders, bringing in a significant figure to prevent such incidents from occurring; otherwise, it wouldn’t have taken two flying sword messages to achieve the desired effect.

The Old Deaf Man.

Mi Yu naturally did not dare to stop him and led this ancient being, one of the peak ten, toward the Hidden Official’s side to discuss matters.

Only to find that Chen Ping'an had already fixed his gaze on the ground beneath himself and the Old Deaf Man.

Mi Yu felt a chill.

Chen Ping'an raised his gaze and told the Old Deaf Man, “Change it; I don’t trust you.”

The Old Deaf Man paused, scratching his head, seemingly unperturbed, and immediately turned to leave, disappearing in an instant.

Before long, he was replaced by another individual—the female sword immortal, Lu Zhi.

Chen Ping'an said, “Lu Zhi, be careful to guard our sword cultivators here from surprise attacks by great demons. If anyone dies, I will hold you accountable!”

Lu Zhi nodded and headed toward the northern city wall to command the battlefield, speaking plainly, “I will not give the Hidden Official any chance for accountability.”

Lin Junbi glanced at Chen Ping'an, who seemed unwilling to even acknowledge Lu Zhi’s words, feeling a rush of admiration.

Chen Ping'an set down his pen, stood up, and went around the desk to crouch over the drawing, “I am even more worried about you all. I will keep an eye on you for half an hour, so I will only give you half an hour to meet my expectations. If anyone fails to meet my standards, you will still be sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage, but you must pass on those tasks that require thought to others. If others can’t do it, then I will personally take over. I simply do not believe that this small group of the most intelligent people in the world can’t measure up to a mere lower five-realm Qi practitioner! If in the end, aside from Chen Ping'an, everyone else in the Hidden Official lineage is deemed useless, I believe the gossip that spreads will not be pleasant.”

All the sword cultivators grew increasingly tense, feeling as if they were facing an enemy even more daunting than being on the battlefield.

Mi Yu's feelings were mixed.

This young man was truly terrifying.

Half an hour later, Chen Ping'an evaluated each of the eleven individuals, standing up with the closed folding fan tapping against his palm, smiling, “Very good, your skills in countering are exceptional. It turns out I am the one who’s idle. Especially you, Pang Yuanji, and Lin Junbi, Guo Zhujiu, in this half hour, you have nearly no flaws; you have made me pick at straws. The others have also exceeded my expectations; keep up the good work. As someone once said, I have an extremely thick skin…”

Before Chen Ping'an could finish, Gu Jianlong, while watching the situation, urgently exclaimed, “Hidden Official, may I speak fairly?!”

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “Scram.”

Gu Jianlong sighed, “Hidden Official, you truly are magnanimous!”

Chen Ping'an waved his hand and said, “In the next minute, find twenty earth demon cultivators. Under the premise that it does not interfere with the overall situation, let’s provide the sword immortal seniors with some easily obtainable military merits. You all should discuss and come up with a list of specific targets from both sides, and once confirmed, send flying swords to our sword immortals. Meanwhile, there’s another matter: who here knows how to use the similar stele expansion technique? You’ll be responsible for duplicating the eleven volumes I have compiled aside from the Ji Ben, ensuring each person has a copy on their desk. This matter can take its time.”

Cao Gun chuckled, “I can do it.”

Chen Ping'an then took the eleven books from his desk and moved them to Cao Gun’s table, squatting beside him to share his insights in a whisper. Cao Gun focused intently, occasionally nodding or asking a question or two.

An hour later.

The great demon Huang Luan, who was sitting on the railing with Yang Zhi, said, “I really want to curse.”

Yang Zhi was filled with intense rage; her two subordinate armies at the flanks of the magical artifact flood often suffered losses of several earth immortals with a single sword light detour. After multiple instances, the losses were significant. This wasn’t the most infuriating part, however; what truly made her anxious and pained was how the sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall only maintained gaps in the sword formation, repeatedly doing so “casually!”

The precision and ruthlessness of those sword immortals’ strikes were as if someone on the barbaric world was leaking information.

The peak great demon, who still bore guilt, had originally been able to intercept and kill the disruptive sword immortals in the barbaric world. However, at this moment, she could no longer sit still and lacked the face to leave the battlefield. She stood up and gazed toward the city wall, her anger boiling, “What the hell is going on?!”

“Fishing again, Yang Zhi, but you might bait the wrong hook; how about we join forces?” 

Huang Luan pointed toward a spot on the city wall where Lu Zhi stood; next to the female sword immortal was a young man holding a folding fan.

Yang Zhi looked over at Lu Zhi. 

If she acted recklessly and attacked the city wall alone, she might not return. But if she teamed up with Huang Luan, they should be safe. Even if they couldn’t gain much, it was unlikely they would be blocked by the Sword Qi Great Wall.

So just as she was about to agree, the young man beside Lu Zhi suddenly seemed to look their way.

He raised his hand high, beaming with a bright smile, and extended his middle finger. Not only that, but he also seemed to utter three words with his lips.

“F*** your mother.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 739: Huang Luan Proposes a Joint Journey to the Sword Qi Great Wall

The proposal from Huang Luan to embark on a joint expedition to the Sword Qi Great Wall was indeed tempting. The sword formations of the Great Wall were intricately connected, leaving nearly no idle swordsmen. Standing on the railing, Yang Zhi had already dispelled her illusions, revealing her kingly demeanor with the imperial crown and a flowing dragon robe. 

Yet, Yang Zhi did not act immediately. Instead, she gazed at the young man atop the city wall and asked Huang Luan, “Is the sword immortal on the city wall the one directing the sword formations? How can he possess such skill? Isn’t he just an outsider traveling the Sword Qi Great Wall? When did the reputation of the Scholar of the Way of Righteousness become so grand? I’ve heard that Lu Zhi has never had a good impression of scholars.”

Earlier, when Chen Ping'an fought against the direct disciple of the Grand Master of the Moon Trampling Mountain, all the great demons atop the wild mountains observed leisurely, their eyes fixed on the scene. However, at that time, ancient beings like Yang Zhi did not think this slightly larger ant had any ability to influence the course of the battle. In a confrontation between the entire world and the Sword Qi Great Wall, even sword cultivators of the Fifth Realm were not indispensable. The three sword immortals of the Great Wall had fallen as easily as stones, merely stirring up a splash of water.

Once, a great demon who had attacked the city returned grievously wounded, ultimately disappearing into the endless river of time, laughing and expressing heartfelt words before his demise. It was said that aside from Chen Qingdu, no one was worth mentioning at the Sword Qi Great Wall. In the Wild Realm, aside from that gray-robed elder who could hold up the heavens, the rest were merely insignificant.

In this matter, neither sword immortals nor great demons had the right to mock the other.

Knowing that Yang Zhi had no intention of taking action, Huang Luan smiled and nodded, “This kid is persistently seeking death; I wonder how long he can remain lively.”

Huang Luan looked at Chen Ping'an, who was standing beside Lu Zhi. “It seems this brat holds a grudge against me. He probably blames me for interfering when he was fighting Li Zhen, sending him a ‘welcome gift.’ Now, he shifts the blame for his senior brother's serious injuries onto me. Such treatment, not only is he ungrateful, but he also has no sense of propriety. I think I should greet him.”

Huang Luan's thoughts stirred, and within the celestial city, an ancient palace with red walls and green tiles, fragrant incense wafting, vanished into thin air, along with a solitary mountain crowned with a stone tablet reading “Ancestral Thoughts of Autumn.” The mountain was barren, adorned only with withered trees, white grass, crimson leaves, and yellow flowers, exuding a sense of desolation and solemnity.

The ancient palace headed towards the city wall where Lu Zhi and Chen Ping'an stood, while the solitary mountain moved towards the two thatched cottages. The ancient palace was split in half by Lu Zhi’s sword strike, crashing heavily against the wall beneath them and turning into powder.

The Sword Immortal Wei Jin from the Snowstorm Temple appeared beside the stone tablet atop the solitary mountain. The next moment, countless sword lights erupted from every crack in the mountain’s flora and stones, then silently disappeared.

This man, the most talented cultivator in the Baoping Continent after Li Tuanjing of the Wind and Thunder Garden, had only just arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall, still a Jade Purity Realm sword cultivator. In just a few years, after living in a small thatched cottage, he had participated in an offensive and defensive battle once and trained swordsmanship alongside the elder sword immortal and his neighboring peers, gaining a hint of the aura of an impending breakthrough to the realm of immortals.

Yang Zhi greeted Huang Luan, and before leaving, she cast a few more glances at the young man, imprinting his image in her mind.

Unexpectedly, the young man not only did not retreat but instead closed his folding fan and made a throat-cutting gesture, the slow movement strikingly conspicuous.

Huang Luan stifled a laugh, finding it amusing. Yang Zhi was the former master of the Yiluo River and a peak Ascendant Realm cultivator. If she were to act impulsively and earnestly compete with Chen Ping'an, it would definitely raise a commotion. Huang Luan would naturally welcome such a turn of events. The loss would fall upon Yang Zhi's subordinate forces, while the martial achievements would count towards Huang Luan's name. Even a mosquito's leg is meat. In the realm of righteousness, where everyone claimed their territory, the one with more elite troops would have a stronger foothold. It was all about human connections, seizing advantages, and seizing opportunities. This was no trivial matter.

However, Huang Luan refrained from speaking any inciting words, knowing it would backfire, making Yang Zhi more resolute and potentially harboring resentment towards her.

In the Wild Realm, there were no rules, which was quite comfortable, but it could also lead to trouble.

Yang Zhi smiled, “Huang Luan, if you can capture this brat and hand him over to me for punishment, apart from compensating you for your expenses, I can additionally offer you a sect's mountain gate from the righteous realm and even a capital city from a great dynasty. How about that?”

Huang Luan shook her head. “Before Chen Ping'an showed up today, I would have definitely agreed to this deal, but now, the price has gone down.”

Yang Zhi's expression darkened.

Huang Luan didn't even glance at the wild realm's female sovereign.

As Yang Zhi rode the wind away, she left behind a lingering phrase that echoed near Huang Luan's railing, “Don't regret it. Remember, if you dare to meddle with any dynasty's capital city beneath the mountains, you will be my enemy.”

Huang Luan rejected not only Chen Ping'an but also the alliance intention that Yang Zhi had implied.

Huang Luan was unfazed by Yang Zhi's threat.

The torrent of magical treasures formed by tens of thousands of demon practitioners remained impressively grand. However, compared to the orderly sword qi waterfall, the former appeared somewhat chaotic. 

Almost all sword immortals had begun to abandon the pursuit of personal gratification in their sword strikes. No longer was each strike a free and unrestrained expression of force; instead, nearly every sword released was imbued with utilitarian calculation. They needed to assess how to break through formations while also safeguarding their own Fifth Realm sword practitioners, and how to coordinate with sword immortals who were positioned far apart to jointly destroy critical treasures. They had to consider how to withdraw their swords while stealthily sending flying swords to either flank of the magical treasure torrent to decapitate some earth immortals among the demon practitioners.

Huang Luan naturally felt a pang of heartache but did not feel overly distressed. The real headache was the military tents in their own camp. 

Regarding their fourteen members' actions, the gray-robed elder had privately established a small rule: if bored, they could take a stroll near the city wall, but it was best not to exert themselves too much, especially with their core divine abilities and hidden techniques, which should ideally be reserved for the righteous realm.

The sword in Lu Zhi’s hand, a standard long sword from the sword workshop, could not withstand the impact of Lu Zhi’s sword intent and the collision with the ancient palace. After she sheathed the sword, it instantly shattered and vanished. She and Chen Ping'an stood on the city wall, turning to glance at the young man wielding the folding fan. “Does the Hidden Official intend to die so easily, or has he decided not to engage in the coming battles? I’m following the elder sword immortal’s orders to guard the formation. This is the duty of all sword practitioners of the Hidden Official lineage, not just Chen Ping'an. Think it through; don’t act impulsively.”

The nature of the great demons from the Wild Realm was nothing to discuss. Earlier, whether it was Chen Ping'an slaying Li Zhen or the two exchanging swords, those beasts did not feel anything was amiss because the Wild Realm never cared about major issues. Yet, for personal grudges, the higher the realm of the beasts, the clearer their memories. Thus, Chen Ping'an’s actions had directly forged deadly enemies with two great demons.

Chen Ping'an lightly tapped his head with the folding fan, and the female demon surprisingly held herself back, feeling some regret. Otherwise, Lu Zhi only needed to delay the great demon Yang Zhi for a moment, and three sword immortals who had already received word from the “Hidden Official” would take action: Yue Qing, Yuan Qingshu, and Wu Chengpei would each employ their own techniques and divine abilities to cut off her retreat. As for who would slay the great demon, it would certainly not be a single elder sword immortal but a multitude of sword immortals. Before reaching the city wall, Chen Ping'an had instructed Guo Zhujiu and Wang Xinshui that if any great demons approached the city wall, they should immediately send word to all the local sword immortals and encircle them.

Now at the Sword Qi Great Wall, even though it appeared that every sword immortal had their roles and worked in harmony to create the magnificent sword qi waterfall, once the Hidden Official's flying swords were dispatched, dozens of sword immortals would have to immediately redirect their sword tips. Even if it led to damage to the sword formations, all sword immortals would have to obey orders.

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “When there are too many lice, they don’t itch; when there are too many debts, they don’t worry. It’s all about getting used to it. Huang Luan and Yang Zhi, once they act impulsively, might become a pair of desperate lovers instead of a celestial couple.”

There was one thing Chen Ping'an did not reveal: of the two flying swords from the “Hidden Official,” the more concealed one went directly to the elder sword immortal. Should any great demon approach, apart from the multitude of sword immortals making their moves, the elder sword immortal would also directly command Chen Xi and Qi Tingji to ensure the demon was slain. Under everyone’s watchful eyes, all sword immortals would intercept the intruder. The two hosts who had inscribed characters atop the city wall were merely opportunistic; no one would dare hold back.

Chen Ping'an not only concluded that the Hidden Official Xiao Xian was a traitor, but he also did not fully trust these two extremely lethal elder sword immortals. This initially appeared to be a significant misfortune.

In truth, it was a matter of trust, with measures in place for trusting. If distrust lingered, there would also be arrangements for that.

If Yang Zhi and Huang Luan believed that the current Sword Qi Great Wall was still the same as it had been for thousands of years, and thought they could traverse it safely, then they would have to pay a price. 

It wasn’t that the sword strikes of the Sword Qi Great Wall had not been high enough over the past ten thousand years. On the contrary, it was precisely because of the generosity and valor displayed by the sword immortals over the past ten thousand years that the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage today had won the leeway to strategize.

Lu Zhi shook her head. “You’re thinking too simply. By the time you reach Yang Zhi’s age and realm, there aren’t many fools left.”

“I suppose I was too naive.” 

Chen Ping'an chuckled. “Fortunately, we haven’t suffered any losses.”

Lu Zhi waved her hand, “Hidden Official, please continue with your work; I’ll keep watch here.”

For this temporarily appointed Hidden Official, Lu Zhi felt she had done enough, even better than she had expected. However, if speaking purely of personal preferences, she held an average impression of Chen Ping'an. 

The reason was simple—he was ultimately not a sword immortal, nor even a sword cultivator.

Chen Ping'an jumped down from the city wall and returned to his desk. He smiled, “Looks like everyone is working hard for nothing. Since nothing came of it, it was merely a gamble for a slim chance.”

As he copied books, Chen Ping'an took the opportunity to review things for all the sword practitioners of the Hidden Official lineage, sharing more of his thoughts with his “subordinates.” He slowly continued, “In this siege by the Wild Realm, we have entered the third phase. The great demon Bai Ying was responsible for the first unveiling battle. Apart from changing the dynamics of time and location to some degree, it was more about reconnaissance and confirming the defensive details of the Sword Qi Great Wall. Coupled with some treacherous flying swords sent by traitorous sword practitioners, the Wild Realm gained an overwhelming advantage. This is an extremely delicate undertaking, which aligns closely with Bai Ying’s historical image. Among the fourteen great demons, Bai Ying has never favored brute force; she plays the game of wits. So if Bai Ying were stationed here, I wouldn’t even have to show up.”

Chen Ping'an paused, pondering briefly, then pointed to a location on a scroll depicting five mountain peaks, saying, “Next, Yang Zhi will be responsible for guarding the five mountain peaks on the battlefield. Compared to Bai Ying, who needs to constantly communicate with sixty military tents, Yang Zhi clearly doesn’t require many last-minute adjustments. Those five mountain peaks conceal five great demons, aiming to cut down our celestial realm sword practitioners. This strategy was set well in advance by the beasts and has little relation to Yang Zhi herself. Following her is the great demon Huang Luan. It’s clear that Yang Zhi is the most straightforward. Even in the face of the scheming between the Yiluo River and her deadly nemesis, the so-called strategies seem shallow. Thus, Yang Zhi is the one most likely to take action, even more so than Huang Luan. If it works out, regardless of whether Huang Luan or Yang Zhi dies at the city wall, as long as a peak great demon dies before the very eyes of all sword practitioners, it would be a tremendous gain for the Sword Qi Great Wall. The repercussions of Xiao Xian’s betrayal could be swiftly addressed by us new sword practitioners of the Hidden Official lineage.”

“What I’m betting on isn’t Yang Zhi’s lack of brains or her foolishness in not knowing the stakes; it’s her status as a scapegoat, betting on her lack of autonomy and on Huang Luan adding a little fuel to the fire. If the Sword Qi Great Wall cannot hold, and the demon clan invades the realm of righteousness, what do they seek? Naturally, it’s the countless miles of mountains and rivers, the great demons’ respective paths, and who do they seek? By relying on brute strength and military achievements? Of course, but the most crucial aspect is a word from the Moon Trampling Mountain, or more accurately, the heart’s intent of the great demon ancestors. It’s just a pity that Yang Zhi did not take the bait and was very cautious. This shows how practical the great demons of the Wild Realm are, which is something that I, along with all of you here, need to learn from. It’s also a reminder to our opponents, thus we cannot make assumptions.”

At this point, Chen Ping'an's gaze sharpened, repeating, “So we cannot make assumptions!”

Chen Ping'an immediately beamed with a smile, “Thus, for the upcoming fourth and fifth phases, whichever great demon is stationed, we can generally predict how the Wild Realm’s offensive will play out. Is it paced, understanding the art of war, or is it mindlessly rushing to death? We can actually make some predictions. However, the opposing side has a full sixty military tents, calculating even more meticulously than we do, making such predictions of limited significance, but better than nothing.”

On the southern city wall, Lu Zhi was left speechless. 

These words clearly stemmed from the Hidden Official’s previous observations atop the city wall. Feeling that there was no chance to converse further, it quickly turned into something she did not want to hear but had to.

Her impression of Chen Ping'an did not improve. 

However, Lu Zhi’s perception of the “Hidden Official” did unconsciously become a little better.

Gazing towards the southern battlefield, Lu Zhi then turned back to the “small world” where no one was striking. After turning back, she bore a hint of a smile.

Perhaps those sword practitioners were the kind of young people the elder sword immortal had been eagerly anticipating.

And she, Lu Zhi, along with many of today’s sword immortals, had likely once been such a young person.

Chen Ping'an looked at everyone, his expression sobering as he feigned shock, “At this point, you all still have no thoughts? I only know that if the Qi Refiners of the lower five realms keep striking, it will exhaust their spirit energy. I never knew that using your brains too much could make you duller.”

As the only sword cultivator of the Fifth Realm, Mi Yu was the most composed, not due to his high realm but because he felt that it had nothing to do with him. If the Hidden Official genuinely harbored discontent, it would be Lin Junbi, Xuan Can, and other younger, yet cunning and unscrupulous little rascals who would take the blame.

Deng Liang said solemnly, “The next army of demons forming the formation will all be sword practitioners. Our change in formation is essentially a lesson we’re teaching them how to wield swords. For example, how the sword immortals can exchange the cost of their strikes to maximize the overall lethality of the sword formation and how to concentrate the strikes of the top sword immortals to attempt to kill the enemy’s earth realm sword practitioners without warning will certainly be learned by them. Even if they only grasp the basic postures, in the next round of exchanges among sword practitioners, if we lack countermeasures, our losses will surely increase dramatically.”

Chen Ping'an pointed with his folding fan towards Lin Junbi, smiling, “Junbi, feel free to speak your mind.”

Lin Junbi immediately had his thoughts organized and smiled, “Given the current situation, we are at a disadvantage, and the sword formation naturally cannot be altered. However, we can change our approach and create a series of concealed traps surrounding all our key earth realm sword practitioners. From now on, all our sword immortals must take on an additional responsibility: to protect the formation of a certain earth realm sword practitioner. Furthermore, protecting the formation should not merely be about passive defense; that would be pointless. Every action must be aimed at fighting back, as we will no longer target the enemy’s earth realm sword practitioners but rather the enemy’s true top forces—the sword immortals!”

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Betting on that slim chance, if they couldn't slay Yang Zhi and Huang Luan, capturing several enemy sword immortals would also not be a loss.

Chen Ping'an had actually been waiting for Deng Liang and Lin Junbi to voice these thoughts. 

Once someone broke the ice, others quickly followed up with their ideas in the blink of an eye.

Gu Jianlong glanced at the confrontation between the flying swords and magical treasures on the scroll, then opened a book on the desk and nodded, “Then we need to quickly exhaust this reference text, striving to select ten to twenty of our earth realm sword practitioners as bait. This reference text was originally the responsibility of Wang Xinshui, and it’s clear that moving forward, it cannot still rest solely on his shoulders. Besides this, we can also conduct a training and evaluation for our sword immortals, trying out more possibilities. Previously, when sword immortals battled demons, they were too focused on individualism, usually just a few familiar sword immortal friends fighting side by side. However, this isn’t necessarily the best partnership. This reference text has become crucial for the next battle. This burden should not rest solely on Wang Xinshui.”

“Hidden Official, what do you think?”

Chen Ping'an propped his chin with one hand, his elbow on the desk, sitting sideways as if casually scribbling on a paper. Beside him lay the reference text already filled with several papers. Chen Ping'an kept writing, glanced at Gu Jianlong, and nodded with a smile, “Fair point. I’ll personally assist Wang Xinshui in perfecting the reference text, outlining the twenty earth realm sword practitioners who will serve as bait.”

Xuan Can followed Gu Jianlong’s train of thought, continuing, “Earlier, we had fewer opportunities to validate the pairing of our sword immortals’ strikes. This is a perfect opportunity to sharpen their skills, ensuring that the cooperation between sword immortals becomes increasingly smooth. With more tangible military achievements, the sword immortals won’t feel too stubborn. Otherwise, if our hidden lineage’s flying sword communications become stale over time, and the novelty fades, the sword immortals, with their lofty pride, will only become more reluctant to engage with us. So, the Hidden Official is correct; our enemies in the Hidden Official lineage, aside from those beasts from the Wild Realm, are our own sword immortals' realms, statuses, and sentiments! We must not overlook this! Regarding this matter, it cannot be a case of improvisation when we’re in a crisis. We need dedicated people to be responsible for this kind of research.”

Dong Buduo interjected, “Leave this to me.”

Lin Junbi hesitated for a moment.

Chen Ping'an said, “Dong Buduo will be responsible for the local sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall, while Lin Junbi will handle all the foreign sword immortals. If Junbi has doubts, all the foreign sword practitioners, including Deng Liang, will answer any questions. As for certain private matters regarding senior sword immortals, should we keep them from the esteemed ones? Set aside those concerns for now. Even if the sword immortals become angry and resentful, it won't fall on your heads. I, this Hidden Official, am not afraid of bloodshed. If I can't protect your interests, then what kind of Hidden Official am I?”

Guo Zhujiu suddenly spoke, “What if the other party has already thought of the same answer as us, that surrounding and slaying the earth realm sword practitioners is a ruse, or even true, but inversely setting up an ambush for our sword immortals is even more real? What then?”

At this point, Guo Zhujiu looked worried as he turned to his master, the current Hidden Official.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Every step we take can only be counted as one or two steps behind. Can we win the game like this? I find it quite difficult. Thus, Guo Zhujiu’s concern is valid. We must always be more wary of the ‘what if’ than those beasts of the Wild Realm. They can withstand multiple contingencies, but we may only face one. If that happens, all the arrangements and efforts of our Hidden Official lineage will collapse and be rendered futile.”

Chen Ping'an turned to the relatively silent Pang Yuanji, “Pang Yuanji, think about how the great sword immortals in the A-volume standard text should adjust their positions atop the city wall and how they should collaborate their strikes. You can ponder that now. As per usual, the plans you come up with, I will take the blame for the bad ones.”

Pang Yuanji nodded, “No problem.”

Chen Ping'an spoke slowly, “According to the progress of the battle, within half a month at most, we will soon find ourselves in an extremely awkward position, where we feel like we’re unable to make ends meet. At that point, we will need to know every single sword practitioner of the Sword Qi Great Wall’s Fifth Realm and earth realm intimately. What then? Should we seek to learn more about the caves, sea-viewing realms, and dragon gate realms of the sword practitioners? We can learn, but that should not be the focus. The focus should be on the southern battlefield, in the A and B-volume primary and secondary texts, especially the thick C-volume that seems to have no last page.”

Chen Ping'an emphasized, “Everyone present, we sword practitioners of the Hidden Official lineage are destined to face disappointment, just varying in degree. Because none of us are perfect, everyone makes mistakes, and each of our small errors cannot be glossed over as mere mistakes. Once they occur, on the battlefield, they could lead to the disastrous consequence of thousands of casualties. All the hard-earned victories and the calculated advantages we’ve gained for the Sword Qi Great Wall can be forgotten by those who are supposed to be our allies. They may either come to scold us or remain silent yet resentful, but the most terrifying thing is silence—the silence of many.”

Feeling himself to be the most superfluous presence, Mi Yu could not help but speak, “Then let’s prove to them that they’re not wrong, but we’re even more right!”

Chen Ping'an opened his folding fan and fanned himself non-stop, “Who still dares to say that our Mi Yu sword immortal is superfluous? Who? Step forward, and I’ll spit in their face!”

Except for Mi Yu, who looked embarrassed, everyone else wore amused expressions.

Mi Yu, forcing a smile, said, “Thank you, Hidden Official.”

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, “Big Brother Mi is our Hidden Official’s anchor. No need for polite words; let’s keep it friendly!”

Gu Jianlong nodded, “Fair point!”

With Gu Jianlong, who was oblivious to the risks, leading the way, soon one after another, voices echoing the words of the Hidden Official arose.

“Agreed.”

“True.”

“Agreed.”

“No objections.”

Chen Ping'an closed the folding fan and lightly set it aside, “Let’s get to work and make some money!”

On the fan's surface, there were small characters written in tiny script. If one did not look closely, it appeared to be a blank fan surface.

Descending from the heavens, spring has arrived. The swords move down the mountain, and summer dares not approach.

A talisman boat docked at the northern city wall, and a person descended—dressed in a blue shirt and holding a sword, looking gaunt and exhausted, as if recovering from a serious illness. He stored the talisman boat into his sleeve and slowly walked toward the Hidden Official lineage.

Not only the sword practitioners of the Hidden Official lineage but even Mi Yu of the Jade Purity Realm was caught off guard.

The Hidden Official they had been with day and night was merely Chen Ping'an’s astral spirit venturing out?

It must be an illusion crafted by the elder sword immortal.

The astral spirit of Chen Ping'an smiled as he stood up, holding the folding fan. He stepped back, merging with the true body that walked forward.

Chen Ping'an lightly grasped the folding fan and walked to his seat, sitting cross-legged as he smiled, “I’ve missed you all.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 740: Peril at Every Turn

The sword cultivators from the Hidden Official lineage were undeniable prodigies of the Dao, true paragons of talent. Their low cultivation levels could only be attributed to one reason: their youth. 

Thus, they were no strangers to the phenomenon of the Yin Spirit (Yin Shen) leaving the body for distant travels, although it was a rare occurrence among third-level Qi practitioners. Being able to remain detached from the physical realm for a prolonged period, unnoticed in the vast expanses filled with sword energy, was even more extraordinary. 

However, such oddities happening to Chen Ping'an didn't pique the curiosity of the sword cultivators, including Mi Yu. 

It was Lu Zhi who observed more keenly and directly asked through their mental connection, “Chen Ping'an, did you plan from the start to let Yang Zhi and Huang Luan take advantage of your earlier provocations?” 

While doodling in the third volume of the booklet, helping Wang Xinshui select twenty of their own Earth Immortal sword cultivators, Chen Ping'an replied with a ripple of his mind, “When ordinary fishing bait is cast into the water, it attracts big fish. Even if those big fish are finally dragged ashore, can the bait still remain? You yourself have said that a cunning old beast like Yang Zhi, having lived to his age, won't be foolish. The means to obstruct their retreat must naturally come from me first; otherwise, our sword immortal's ambush would be unsustainable.” 

Lu Zhi frowned, “Once the Yin Spirit collapses, it would damage the foundation of the Dao. As a Hidden Official, why must you go this far?” 

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “For the Yin Spirit of a third-level cultivator, trading it for one or two of the pinnacle ascendant beasts from the savage world is a bargain.” 

Lu Zhi hesitated momentarily; she did not appreciate Chen Ping'an's roundabout speech earlier, so she said bluntly, “Please be sincere with me.” 

After a brief silence, Chen Ping'an replied, “The Hidden Official lineage needs more than just invisible military achievements to establish itself. The biggest problem is that we remain behind the scenes, too comfortable. Everyone is a sword cultivator, yet no one has ever struck a single blow. This is fine during times of victory, but as casualties mount in the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Hidden Official lineage will inevitably face criticism. This is human nature. So, if I pay a little price early on, the whole Hidden Official lineage can avoid some mental strain. With the Hidden Official lineage clear-minded to strategize and deploy, in the long run, the benefits to the Sword Qi Great Wall will be immense.” 

Lu Zhi shook her head, “What you said is likely true, but I know you haven't revealed the full reason.” 

Chen Ping'an did not deny it. “Some thoughts must be kept close to the heart. Lu, the Great Sword Immortal, let’s not dig deeper into this; it’s meaningless.” 

For instance, why was he not devastated by the severe injuries to his senior brother? Was it merely because he was reserved and adept at hiding his feelings? Certainly not. 

Deep inside, Chen Ping'an hoped his senior brother would survive and live with a clear conscience; above all, he could never accept that “Zuo is dead.” 

The Great Sword Immortal once mentioned in the Ning residence's martial arts arena that if there was a good outcome, one should look back on life with kindness everywhere. 

It was in this vein that Chen Ping'an accepted that the Great Sword Immortal had confined his Yin Spirit and forbade him from sending word to his senior brother, urging him to be wary of a Hidden Official’s ambush. 

Afterward, when Chen Ping'an visited his senior brother at the thatched cottage, he felt no anger towards the Great Sword Immortal, nor did he hold any grudges. 

One should speak little of “what ifs” in life; after all, what if Zuo had been killed by the previous Hidden Official, Xiao Xun, with a single punch? 

Chen Ping'an concluded the conversation, “Lu Zhi, you focus on protecting the Hidden Official lineage with all your might. Just wield your sword; there’s no need to concern yourself with anything else.” 

Lu Zhi, rarely one for jokes, replied, “You carry yourself with such authority, Hidden Official.” 

Chen Ping'an could only awkwardly mimic his own disciples, pulling from the unorthodox teachings of Falling Star Mountain, and smiled as he added, “Your swordsmanship is divine, almost celestial. Whether my official stature is great in your eyes, I am but a laughingstock.” 

Lu Zhi laughed it off. 

Chen Ping'an was multitasking intensely. 

He sketched out various Earth Immortals in the third volume and communicated details with Wang Xinshui, who was in charge of the documentation. 

He paid close attention to the movements of the two scrolls along the horse path; this was the duty of a Hidden Official—delegation did not mean neglect. 

He also needed to observe the eleven sword cultivators closely, listening to their conversations and exchanges, much like a bureaucrat overseeing an inspection. 

Chen Ping'an set down his brush and habitually rubbed his wrist, unexpectedly reminded of Volume Six of “The Pearl Ship,” which mentioned “Young Wisdom.” 

Looking around, the eleven sword cultivators present, if they were in the Vast World (Haoran Tianxia), would likely qualify for both cultivation and scholarship given their talents. 

Among them, a few stood out particularly, like Xuan Can, who was practically a living map. His attention to and memory of the two scrolls surpassed even Chen Ping'an's capabilities. Xuan Can had a detailed account in his mind of every geographical feature on the battlefield, such as why a certain pit appeared, when it appeared, and how it would affect the ensuing combat; he had an exceptionally meticulous ledger in his mind. Others could achieve what Xuan Can did with effort, but it would require far more focus and would not come as naturally as it did to him. 

Thus, Chen Ping'an specifically requested Xuan Can to write a battlefield record, which would later serve as a reference for the other sword cultivators. 

Wang Xinshui had an astonishing instinct for predicting small-scale battles. Therefore, whenever Chen Ping'an found himself with some free time, he enjoyed observing Wang Xinshui, akin to taking a leisurely drink. 

When Wang Xinshui noticed the key moments on the scrolls where sword cultivators failed to strike perfectly or made too many mistakes, his expression would change; if the enemy's treasures coordinated too well, Wang Xinshui would become anxious. However, the battlefield was ever-changing, and to remember these details, Wang Xinshui often fixated on the scrolls, scribbling fervently, his handwriting almost illegible. Occasionally, he would appear dejected, seemingly unaware of whether what he saw, thought, remembered, or wrote would be useful, given that he, as a sword cultivator of the Hidden Official lineage, was too far from the battlefield. Could he replace the sword cultivators in battle? Thus, Wang Xinshui often displayed the most complex and vivid expressions; in just a few blinks, all emotions could cross his face, compounded by his habit of muttering to himself, making it all the more interesting. 

Lin Junbi’s overall planning skills resembled a kind of innate divine ability; as long as he had enough information and intelligence to support a battle, he rarely made mistakes. 

Guo Zhujiu was adept at envisioning worst-case scenarios—“unexpected events”—often thinking a step ahead, or even further. 

Thus, with Dong Budai and Lin Junbi collaborating on the book “The Sword Immortal’s Heart,” after Chen Ping'an had taken his seat, apart from clearly stating that Xuan Can would write a battlefield record, he also asked Wang Xinshui, Guo Zhujiu, and others to each write a “collection of essays.” Previously, Chen Ping'an had outlined twelve volumes, named after the heavenly stems, and now these could be named after the earthly branches. 

With both heavenly stems and earthly branches complete, the sword cultivators stood in the center, symbolizing harmony among people—a good omen, indeed. 

Dong Budai suddenly said, “What worries me is that the sword cultivators from the savage world might advance using the simplest method, focusing solely on their coordination, without considering anything else, and not seeking military achievements. If that’s the case, our subsequent calculations will all fall short. The most troubling part is that if we gain nothing, it’s a loss. If that happens, how shall we resolve it?” 

Chen Ping'an raised his head, chuckling softly, “It can be resolved. The battle at the Sword Qi Great Wall, with its grand strategies and heroic spirit, can become a double-edged sword; being immersed in battle, surrounded by familiar comrades who fall one after another, we mustn’t truly regard them as mere puppets devoid of education and emotions. After the thirteenth conflict, the demon clans’ assaults on the city were all practiced rehearsals; now the savage world has established sixty military camps. What does this imply? It means that every battlefield is under close scrutiny; the human heart is infectious.” 

“So, to prevent the enemy's sword formations from achieving a ‘stable but not losing’ state, we can take three actions: First, our sword formations should learn from the great hunts, mercilessly slaughtering the enemy troops. Second, for those we can’t kill, we should severely wound but not kill them; the more they suffer, the better. After withdrawing from the battlefield, these injured soldiers will become a natural source of resentment. Third, we should choose those who are bickering fiercely and love to quarrel, like the two seniors, Zhao Ge and Cheng Quan; I think they are quite suitable. While striking, they must curse the heavens and the earth, especially cursing the sword cultivators from the savage world, for their attempt to attack the city and seek out swords is essentially a ‘return to one’s roots.’ These words must be shouted by the sword immortals, especially the younger ones with louder voices, who should curse even more. If we accomplish these three tasks, we won’t allow the sword cultivators, whose lives are most valuable in the savage world, to think of doing anything extra; if the enemy is willing to act, we will have our chance.” 

At this point, Chen Ping'an laughed, “Earlier, when I faced Li Zhen in combat, did you truly believe I felt no hatred or anger at his words? How is that possible? At that moment, I could hardly wait to chew on his flesh, to flay that scoundrel. However, since it was merely a standoff, I couldn’t afford to be distracted for a moment and had to suppress that emotion. But afterward, when the two armies faced off, with tens of thousands of sword cultivators against tens of thousands of sword cultivators, the human heart always has some leeway. Remember, while we are focused on the two scrolls right before us, just beginning to understand the emotional threads of our sword immortals, we must also consider how the savage world perceives this war and all the battlefields. Once we understand this, many things could allow us to foresee the future, not only following the current but also creating our own momentum, turning it into a grand scheme where the savage world cannot enter.” 

Lin Junbi nodded, deeply moved, “Indeed, if our Hidden Official lineage could transform the entire battlefield into a small world, we could seize every advantage.” 

Chen Ping'an continued, “Imagine if we completely understood the thoughts of the Great Ancestor and the aspirations of the peak demon lords of the Fourteen Thrones? What kind of scene would that be?” 

Everyone fell silent in shock. 

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Of course, this is impossible. Human power is limited; knowing when to accept fate is also a skill.” 

Guo Zhujiu suddenly said, “With a decent set of the second volume, I can actually follow the clues and delve into the hidden files of the previous Hidden Official lineage, gaining deeper insights into the secrets and undercurrents of the savage world. It might be worth guessing at the thoughts of those great demons. I certainly won’t waste time on trivial matters; you don’t need to worry one hundred percent, just one will suffice…” 

However, as soon as she uttered the title of ‘master,’ Guo Zhujiu immediately fell silent, irritated at her own slip of tongue. She felt guilty for embarrassing her master, as the rules of the Hidden Official lineage were still to be observed. 

Chen Ping'an replied, “It’s fine to call me master; just as I prefer it when others call me Chen Ping'an instead of addressing me awkwardly as 'Hidden Official.'” 

Gu Jianlong felt relieved and smiled brightly, but just as he was about to speak up, Chen Ping'an turned to him, saying, “Brother Gu, does this mean you've acknowledged your own ‘awkwardness’? You’re easily baited; you need to work on your heart. The Hidden Official’s courtesy is just that—courtesy. You really don’t need to stand on ceremony with me. If you were in the Vast World, relying solely on talent for your livelihood, you’d find it impossible to navigate the officialdom, literary circles, and the martial world.” 

Gu Jianlong looked as if he had lost his soul, fearing he might be subjected to some petty mischief. 

Chen Ping'an continued, “If it weren’t for Sword Immortal Mi providing that answer earlier, I might have regretted bringing up that topic. Everyone, we are here doing these things not because we must; even those foreign sword cultivators like Xuan Can, much less locals like Dong Budai and Pang Yuanzhi, should not bear the weight of heavy burdens alone. A careless misstep could shatter their Dao hearts. Compared to fighting on the city walls, which would you choose, Pang Yuanzhi?” 

Pang Yuanzhi replied honestly, “To strike.” 

Wang Xinshui was about to speak. 

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Hmm? Xinshui also has something to say?” 

Wang Xinshui quickly adapted, “Hidden Official, I want to second Pang Yuanzhi.” 

Wang Xinshui was indeed quite special; he was a genius sword cultivator whose thoughts moved swiftly, but his strikes often lagged behind. Because his cultivation was not high enough, he frequently hindered himself on the battlefield. It wouldn’t be accurate to say he acted recklessly; every suggestion he made was quite apt. However, Wang Xinshui himself could not express himself with swordplay, nor could his friends. Hence, he earned the title of one of the recent five prodigies of the Sword Qi Great Wall: “I can prepare before the battle, but afterward, it’s all mine.” 

Fortunately, there hadn’t been overly severe casualties. However, Wang Xinshui felt very conflicted about the idea of participating in battle—not out of fear of death but because it left him feeling restless, as if he was constantly bumping against his own heart’s desires. 

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “We’ve exchanged enough pleasantries. From now on, I may frequently leave this place and roam around. If you harbor resentment, remember to hide it well. Moreover, when it comes to going out to fight, you certainly won’t have the chance; I will, so just envy me.” 

The composed yet flexible Deng Liang spoke up, “A golden child does not sit in a cluttered hall. This may be a huge joke in the Sword Qi Great Wall, but here, Hidden Official, you should still think twice before acting. Even if you truly want to leave the city walls to fight, please be cautious of your whereabouts. Without you, our Hidden Official lineage would be forced to change commanders at the front line, which is a great military taboo.” 

“Thank you for your kind intentions. This kind of frankness should be a rule of our Hidden Official lineage. Behind closed doors, we are all family; family should speak a few harsh words to each other, and that is a good thing.” 

Chen Ping'an added, “However, those who can kill me, like Yang Zhi and Huang Luan, still dare not take risks to act. As for the other beasts, they’re forgetful and disbelieving in evil; they can certainly come find me to test their luck.” 

Deng Liang recalled the earlier moment when the female sword immortal Xie Songhua achieved her victory with a single strike and kept silent thereafter. 

Chen Ping'an stood up, “I’m going to find my two seniors, Nalan Shao Wei and Yan Ming, for a chat.” 

He grabbed the “Hidden Official” jade token and hung it at his waist. He needed to discuss the matters regarding the cross-continental ferry at the Upside-Down Mountain with these two fellow travelers. This wasn’t something that could be clarified in a few words; it required a face-to-face meeting. 

Some matters could only be addressed in the capacity of the Hidden Official. 

Walking along the horse path, Chen Ping'an muttered to himself, “In the world of knowledge, nothing is more difficult to deal with than a night sailing ship.” 

Mi Yu glanced at the young man’s back, feeling a strange swirl of unexplainable emotions. 

Earlier, Chen Ping'an's distant travels with his Yin Spirit stationed at the Hidden Official lineage had been peculiar. 

His words and actions always carried a sense of danger and strangeness, each sentence deeply thoughtful, accumulating authority invisibly, tightening the grip on the Hidden Official’s power, even leading people to unconsciously ponder Chen Ping'an’s thoughts. 

Now, however, Chen Ping'an seemed to have shifted his mindset. 

Which was better, Mi Yu couldn’t say. 

In truth, it was all just a mess. 

He was, after all, a Jade Purity Realm sword cultivator, yet here he found himself as the most reticent one, especially as he thought of his grievances with the Wen Sheng lineage, which only added to his frustration. 

In the end, Mi Yu rubbed his chin, muttering, “Is my mind really that dull?” 

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an turned and called out, “Sword Immortal Mi, join me; I estimate you will soon have your hands full.” 

With no choice but to follow along, Mi Yu felt a sense of relief after speaking with Chen Ping'an, realizing it was a good thing; he could also take a breather at the Upside-Down Mountain. 

Not only that, but Chen Ping'an even actively asked Mi Yu for his thoughts on whether certain ideas were feasible. 

Mi Yu spoke honestly, refuting one by one. 

This young Hidden Official didn’t seem to be particularly disheartened. 

The owner of the Spring Fan Pavilion, Shao Yunyan, was well-known for being reclusive at the Upside-Down Mountain. 

Today, Shao Yunyan had strolled through the four major private residences, passing by the Ape Ruan Mansion, the Water Crystal Palace, and the Plum Blossom Garden, merely glancing at them from a distance. 

Having cast an illusion spell and not being one to seek the limelight, very few recognized this sword immortal. 

Finally, Shao Yunyan found a tavern, knocked on the door with his magic, and the ripples spread out. The door opened, and he stepped over the threshold. Inside, the business remained dismal; aside from himself, there were no other customers. 

In this dwindling paradise, he aimed to drink a cup of Forgetting Worries Wine. 

It was almost a ritual for every wandering sage who traveled to the Upside-Down Mountain. 

The old man sat behind the counter, dozing off, while on the counter sat a jade poem of an eight-treasure birdcage, where a small yellow sparrow dozed just like the old man. 

A young man named Xu Jia spotted Shao Yunyan and was quite pleased, primarily because he remembered the owner of the Spring Fan Pavilion had once borrowed a gourd vine from him. Thus, among the many familiar patrons, Xu Jia, known for his laziness, was especially attentive today, quickly bringing a jar of wine to the table. 

Although Xu Jia had never interacted with Shao Yunyan, he had heard that this sword immortal from the Northern Julu Continent had visited here long ago, drinking wine, but unable to pay, he had traded a sword-raising gourd from the gourd vine for a jar of wine and ended up drunkenly intoxicated. Later, after making money, he regretted not paying the market price, offering a bunch of Gu Yu coins instead, but the tavern owner refused, and Shao Yunyan, somewhat offended, never returned to drink. 

Standing against the wall, Shao Yunyan looked around and smiled, “It’s been seven or eight hundred years since I last came, and it’s almost covered a wall. Is the business here that good?” 

Xu Jia complained, “The people are infuriating. I heard there’s a tavern at the Sword Qi Great Wall selling that terrible wine, which just opened over a year ago, and their useless signboards are almost covering three walls now.” 

Shao Yunyan apologized to the young waiter, picked up the jar of Forgetting Worries Wine, and sat back at the table where he first drank all those years ago. He poured himself a bowl of wine and looked toward the counter, saying with a smile, “Shopkeeper, that gourd vine has already been taken by a young girl to the Water Scripture Mountain in the Northern Julu Continent. In about a decade or so, that gourd for raising swords will be ripe, and I’ll trouble you to send someone to retrieve it. Regarding the ownership of this gourd, I’ve already informed Water Scripture Mountain; the person will show up to take it, it’s that simple.” 

The old man grunted and opened his eyes, glancing at Xu Jia, “Are you going?” 

Xu Jia asked, “If I leave the tavern and just happen to have the young lady return, what should I do?” 

The old man laughed and scolded, “I just don’t understand, why do you have to hang yourself from one tree? My daughter has no beauty, no figure, and her mind is muddled; she’s been attached to someone for a long time. How could she possibly be worthy of you?” 

Xu Jia retorted, “I’ve been here since childhood; how many girls have I seen? If I don’t like the young lady, who else would I like?! Would I like you, old man?” 

The old man wasn’t angry. His daughter had been away for many years, and with only the old man and the young one remaining in this desolate place, he couldn’t afford to scold him. If he were too harsh, there would be a risk of his daughter running away again, leading to significant losses for the tavern. 

The old man smiled, “Then you should get out of here and go see the world; the truly beautiful women will dazzle you.” 

Xu Jia nodded, “I also miss Cao Ci. Once I get that sword-raising gourd in the Northern Julu Continent, I’ll go find him in the Central Continent.” 

At this point, Xu Jia walked over to the counter, shaking the birdcage, and scolded, “You fool, why couldn’t you recognize Chen Ping'an’s martial roots back then? Did you think it was all just a sham?” 

The yellow sparrow in the cage was of the same breed as the yellow sparrow of the three palm sects of Qingtian, yet one was to test literary fortune, while the other tested martial fortune. 

Shao Yunyan chuckled, “Shopkeeper, got a story to tell?” 

The old man waved his hand, “Just drink your wine. Treating Forgetting Worries Wine as ordinary wine is a waste. If it weren’t for that sword-raising gourd, I wouldn’t care to sell you a drop of wine.” 

As Shao Yunyan drank, he casually asked, “Is the Water Crystal Palace still dreaming of making a fortune, thinking only of profits? They can’t seem to change, but the Ape Ruan Mansion has already cleared out. Still, none of that matters; I just want to know where this tavern will be located in the future. There are countless types of celestial wines, and I’ve practically drunk them all. The only ones I still remember fondly are your Forgetting Worries Wine and the Qing Shen Mountain wine from the Bamboo Sea Cave.” 

The old man glanced at his disciple, still sulking with the yellow sparrow, and bypassed the counter to bring a jar of wine, sitting down beside Shao Yunyan and pouring a bowl for each to enjoy. 

The old man said, “I’m an outsider, and you’re an outsider; naturally, you’re more comfortable. Why meddle in these affairs? Since you’ve meddled, whether this tavern opens here or in the far reaches of the sky, even if you find the answer, can you still drink the wine?” 

Shao Yunyan laughed and asked, “Can I speak my mind?” 

The old man nodded, “You know the rules of the tavern. The drunken words of the drinkers will not go outside.” 

Shao Yunyan looked toward the tavern's entrance, where white mist swirled, and softly said, “Years ago, I promised the Sword Qi Great Wall to do something; I can’t back out.” 

The old man asked, “Can’t you run?” 

The old man quickly nodded, “Difficult.” 

Shao Yunyan laughed, “No need to run. As long as you don’t leave the Upside-Down Mountain in a grand manner and act a bit sneaky, it’ll be fine.” 

The old man paused for a moment, “In that case, are you still willing to stay? With your level of cultivation and swordsmanship, it’s not enough to be of use; you’re just courting death. It’s better to die drunk than to die foolishly. Fine, I’ll give you another jar of wine.” 

Shao Yunyan said, “The Hidden Official has already defected to the savage world.” 

The old man raised an eyebrow, “That Xiao Xun girl holds such great resentment against the Vast World?” 

Shao Yunyan laughed, “I heard a new Hidden Official has taken charge. If you can guess who it is, I won’t drink a jar of wine from your tavern for free; you can take three guesses.” 

The old man pondered for a moment, “Is it the one who made the most money following Ah Liang, or is it that girl Ning Yao? It wouldn’t be that child chosen by Xiao Xun, would it? What was his name again?” 

Xu Jia replied, “I believe it’s Pang Yuanzhi.” 

Shao Yunyan burst into laughter, “A jar of Forgetting Worries Wine for free; my spirits are high.” 

Shao Yunyan drank two jars of Forgetting Worries Wine in one go and, feeling tipsy, left the tavern, satisfied with his visit. 

The old tavernkeeper shared some amusing tales with him, such as inner secrets concerning the fifth realm of the world. The vast rivers and mountains stretched for thousands of miles, containing treasures of geomancy and ancient sites, new paradises waiting to be claimed. It seemed the Qingtian realm could also share in the fortune, with various astonishing pathways of the Dao awaiting those fated to encounter them. The old tavernkeeper imparted the most weighty gossip, something Shao Yunyan had never heard of or even imagined: many Confucian saints, not only establishing their territories and stabilizing the world throughout the ages, had quietly fallen in battle, and the number of those who died in war was not small. Thankfully, the “Sage of Rites,” who was said to be “transcending the earthly realm,” was still present, leading Confucian saints into the unknown beyond the heavens, standing against some obstinate ancient deities for a long time. 

Shao Yunyan couldn’t help but ask a question at that moment, “Is it unnecessary for the other three realms?” 

The old tavernkeeper shook his head, “Unnecessary.” 

Shao Yunyan wanted to ask the reason behind that. 

As the ancestor of a hundred schools of thought, the old man said, “Not knowing is for the best.” 

Shao Yunyan strolled back through a scene much like the Ape Ruan Mansion, returning to his own residence. 

Every step he took was fraught with peril. 

Because they were all atop the Upside-Down Mountain. 

Traveling with Sword Immortals Ku Xia and Lin Junbi along the border of the Sword Qi Great Wall, they neither remained at the city walls to slay enemies nor followed young men like Jiang Guancheng to Nan Posa Continent. 

Sitting in that Plum Blossom Garden, he played chess with the rosy-faced lady, basking in the romance of life. 

Yet today, he left the garden and went to the Ferry Pavilion to observe the back-and-forth of the cross-continental ferries. 

The Ferry Pavilion was regarded as the most misnamed scenic spot at the Upside-Down Mountain, yet it remained bustling every day; the small pavilion was always packed with people except during the deep of night. 

Bian Jing didn’t join the crowd but sat on a white jade viewing platform railing outside the Ferry Pavilion, speaking to himself through mental waves. 

Bian Jing chuckled, “Aren’t you always boasting about being old friends with that old deaf man? There are no other sword immortals guarding the prison where the old deaf man is; there’s no chance at all for anything to happen?” 

“Not a chance; it’s best not to touch that mess.” 

Bian Jing sighed, “I just can’t understand how you savage world beings, with such high cultivation, can still be so narrow-minded.” 

“Using crafty tricks, twisting and turning, is that also a part of the Dao?” 

Bian Jing, ever the instigator, smiled and asked, “Is that ‘Dao Old Two’ who caused your downfall really invincible?” 

“Without truly facing him, you wouldn’t grasp the terror of that rotten old bull’s nose.” 

Bian Jing expressed regret, “It’s a pity that Lady Gui from the Old Dragon City in Baopingzhou didn’t agree to Lady Hongyan's invitation.” 

“It’s a pity; her true form is the most orthodox Moon Palace type. If she were willing to collaborate on a grand scheme, our odds would be even greater.” 

Bian Jing laughed, “We? It’s you who should say that; I'm just a little role with no say.” 

“Even if I’m a little role, my heart still belongs to me; don’t act like an innocent bystander.” 

Bian Jing remarked, “According to the latest news from Lady Hongyan, many sword immortals with stirring hearts are currently in a very awkward position, practically sitting on a wax figure. They probably can’t wait to hack that second shopkeeper to pieces.” 

This time, the “old immortal” didn’t engage with Bian Jing. 

Bian Jing gazed at the cross-continental ferries, noticing the joy on everyone’s faces that was hard to conceal, and he smiled, “Seeing so many people like this lifts my spirits significantly; I no longer feel guilty.” 

Coming to the Upside-Down Mountain to conduct business with the Sword Qi Great Wall, trading items for items, was the most profitable endeavor—arriving laden and returning even more heavily laden. Once back in their home continent, they could flip their goods for staggering profits. 

“Three years without opening, when we do, we feast for three years,” this was about those ferries conducting various businesses. 

Moreover, during times of great war, every round trip of these ferries became increasingly profitable, as they held the bargaining chips for rock-bottom pricing. 

Bian Jing nodded, “There’s no right or wrong; only positions. A profound truth, I wholeheartedly agree.” 

A ripple of mental waves arose, “Is that sarcasm?” 

Bian Jing laughed and shook his head, “No, I genuinely feel that way. Just like having a fist is the only truth; I completely endorse that.” 

Bian Jing surveyed his surroundings. 

Soon, the world would change. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 741: Assassination of the Hidden Official

Chen Ping'an first found Yan Ming, and the two strolled together, with Mi Yu following at a distance.

One was trying to retrieve the Yan family's account books, while the other was inquiring in detail about the trading rules concerning the Sword Qi Great Wall and the cross-continental ferry to the Upside-Down Mountain. 

The real issue at hand was the Yan family's financial situation. If they fronted some divine money, how long could they afford to sustain losses in a series of transactions, and how could the Sword Qi Great Wall compensate for the Yan family's losses?

One was a small sect, and the other a wealthy merchant; the two conversed for over half an hour, each calculating their own interests.

On the way, Chen Ping'an spoke openly with Mi Yu. Mi Yu felt that it was difficult to discuss matters with Nalan Shaowei, but with Yan Ming, there should be no significant issues. After all, Chen Ping'an was already a Hidden Official and had been given a great authority in times of crisis. Furthermore, Chen Ping'an and the Yan family's eldest son had a very good relationship, so Yan Ming should be willing to help him out, both for public and private reasons. Most importantly, Chen Ping'an's words held weight with the Grand Sword Immortal.

After bidding farewell to Yan Ming, Chen Ping'an went to find Nalan Shaowei. In terms of external commerce, both the Yan family and the Nalan family were prestigious names associated with the Sword Qi Great Wall. The top three families—Dong, Chen, and Qi—controlled the clothing, sword-making, and alchemy industries, making Yan Ming and Nalan Shaowei true financial deities in a sense.

Mi Yu asked, "Was it smooth sailing?"

Chen Ping'an chuckled self-deprecatingly, "The general direction is fine, but there are many stumbling blocks with the details. I thought I could start easy with the two seniors and then tackle the hard stuff, but it seems it's going to be harder than I thought."

Mi Yu teased, "Those times when the Hidden Official called him 'Uncle Yan' must have been for nothing."

Immediately, this sword immortal, who loved to drink and enjoy the moon, showed a hint of irritation. "Is Yan Ming too ungrateful? Not giving an ounce of respect to the Hidden Official? I’ve got the logic down—unity in glory and loss—but Yan Ming is being so indecisive. Did he not want to climb the city after losing both arms in his youth, or is he just afraid that the Hidden Official will take his financial power?"

Mi Yu was not the least bit intimidated by Yan Ming, who had fallen from the Golden Core realm.

There was an abundance of divine money, yet it couldn't be used on his life-protecting flying sword. This pitiful situation was worse than those sword cultivators who diligently fought monsters and painstakingly nurtured their swords.

Chen Ping'an shook his head, saying, "It’s not that simple. Yan Ming is very meticulous with his accounts. Since the general direction has been agreed upon, it’s not a bad thing to negotiate the details further. I can just meet him a few more times. That being said, Yan Ming's attitude shows he doesn't think the Hidden Official is worth more than divine money, which is a true responsibility to the Sword Qi Great Wall."

Mi Yu quietly asked, "Hidden Official, do you truly harbor no grievances?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "More often, it’s about enjoying the comfortable things. For someone like Mi Jianxian, such an extraordinary being, it’s quite difficult to advance boldly in their realm. Tough times are to be endured; every bit of it is beneficial."

Mi Yu fell silent.

There was still some resentment. However, he had no means to deal with Yan Ming, so he pitied himself instead.

Yet, Mi Yu could tolerate the direct words from Chen Ping'an; what truly bothered him were the polite smiles from certain sword immortals, who greeted him merely as a courtesy. For instance, the past Li Tui, or those who didn’t even bother to glance at him, like the grand sword immortal Yue Qing, who shared a close bond with his brother Mi Hu. With Mi Yu, Yue Qing never spoke ill words because he simply wouldn’t speak at all. Those dull blades, wrapped in silk, were the most damaging to a sword heart.

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Let’s keep the harsh words between ourselves, Mi Jianxian."

Upon arriving at Nalan Shaowei's place, the old sword immortal merely stated, "I never concern myself with financial matters; go speak with Nalan Caihuan."

Chen Ping'an then sought out Nalan Caihuan, a female sword cultivator of the Golden Core realm. While her level wasn't high, she was adept at managing her household and generating wealth.

At this, Mi Yu truly lost his temper. "This old Nalan is being too unreasonable?!"

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

Mi Yu only dared to grumble after the fact.

Earlier, he had been too intimidated to even breathe in front of Nalan Shaowei.

They found Nalan Caihuan, a beautifully adorned woman with a graceful figure. Her hair was pinned up with a jade hairpin, its tail intricately carved into a lifelike dragonfly. She had delicate features with dark eyebrows, wearing a thin silk gown with golden threads, and stepping into a pair of red brocade shoes, she was recognized as a great beauty in the Sword Qi Great Wall.

She looked like a pampered noblewoman, yet when she reached the battlefield, her sword was as fierce and sharp as Qi Shou. 

Mi Yu felt conflicted and purposely wore a cold expression.

Nalan Caihuan and Mi Yu were peers, and although Mi Yu was regarded as a decorative pillow in the eyes of sword immortals, many women admired him, and those who desired him often cursed him more fiercely than men. Nalan Caihuan was one of them. Before Mi Yu became a sword immortal, his life had been too smooth, which led to his saying, "Affection has never endured through the ages." In reality, it wasn't that he couldn't hold onto anyone, but rather that the devoted women from the Sword Qi Great Wall and the world of Haoran simply couldn't hold onto him.

Mi Yu observed people.

What Chen Ping'an saw, however, were the mountains of gold and silver belonging to the Nalan family.

The first words that Chen Ping'an spoke almost made Mi Yu lose his composure.

"Nalan Madam, your family head has agreed to assist me. The old sword immortal is deeply principled and sacrifices his family's interests to help the Sword Qi Great Wall through this crisis. However, he also reminded me that the Nalan family is under your authority, so I should inform you."

After that, Nalan Caihuan collected her thoughts and began discussing the subsequent arrangements and negotiating details with the Hidden Official who had received the "ancestor's decree."

The two returned along the path leading back to the Hidden Official's area.

Mi Yu found it absurd and softly asked, "When Nalan Caihuan chats with Nalan Shaowei later, won’t the Hidden Official’s cover be blown?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Sky-high prices, pay based on ability. If Nalan Shaowei doesn’t want to hear what I say, then let Nalan Caihuan speak on it."

Finally, Chen Ping'an joked, "If Nalan Madam comes to accuse me, I reckon that Mi Jianxian alone can handle her. But if Nalan Shaowei personally comes to attack me, you, Big Brother Mi, must protect me."

Mi Yu forced a smile, "Isn’t there still Lu Zhi? It's not up to me to wrestle with that old Nalan."

Whether it was Nalan Shaowei or Lu Zhi, they both ranked among the top ten sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall, and in the past, even if Mi Yu didn’t take a detour upon seeing them, he would still feel ashamed and filled with awe.

Most of the friends Mi Yu could converse with were sword cultivators at the Fifth Level, and many were flirts; there were very few sword immortals at the Sixth Level.

As he accompanied Chen Ping'an, only one sword immortal of the jade purity realm called out to Mi Yu, named Lie Ji. In terms of cultivation, he was a kindred spirit with Mi Yu, belonging to the category of those who were outstanding in youth but ultimately fell short. In the world of Haoran, it might be a significant regret unique to sword immortals, yet in the Sword Qi Great Wall, it was an open joke.

It was said that Lie Ji was impatient with quietude and was quite talkative, once having the nickname "Magpie." However, the young people of the Sword Qi Great Wall didn’t find such a ridiculous nickname fitting for Sword Immortal Lie Ji.

Lie Ji often came to find Mi Yu to drink and relieve his boredom.

At this moment, when Lie Ji saw Chen Ping'an, he cheerfully called out, "Hidden Official!"

Chen Ping'an, originally strolling with his sleeves draped, smiled and nodded, extending his hand from his sleeve, clasping his fists in return.

After walking a distance, Chen Ping'an joked, "Mi Jianxian has a wide circle of friends! I’m fortunate to benefit from that."

Mi Yu glanced at the southern wall, and like Pang Yuanji, he actually preferred to draw his sword and slay monsters.

In the following days, apart from overseeing the Hidden Official’s area, Chen Ping'an frequently summoned Mi Yu to discuss matters with important figures.

All of them were big shots.

For instance, the sages of the Confucian and Buddhist sects located at both ends of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Ping'an wanted to clarify the ins and outs regarding the "Dispute of Heavenly Timing."

During this time, Mi Yu noticed that Ning Yao had donned a robe of celestial-grade quality, along with a newly crafted sword box containing two long swords. One of those swords was the very one Chen Ping'an used to slay Li Zhen, aptly named "Sword Immortal." It was indeed a fine name. No wonder the young Hidden Official occasionally chatted idly with Gu Jianlong and Wang Xinshui at the desk, claiming that he had exceptional talent in naming things; if naming were the only great path to cultivation in the world, he would already be at the threshold of immortality.

Pang Yuanji casually mentioned that the Hidden Official’s line had collected thousands of years' worth of archived records. The summer retreat and winter residence had been properly categorized and were numerous. It was impossible to move them all to the horse-walking path for searching and perusing, making it much more convenient to browse through them there, especially at the summer retreat, which was of utmost importance. Rather than waiting until the last minute and making someone run back and forth, it would be better to just move the necessary archives to the summer retreat. The Hidden Official’s message-carrying flying swords were indeed rapid; they could simply transfer one of the scrolls to one of the residences. Otherwise, with all the sword cultivators from the Hidden Official’s line gathered at the horse-walking path, they would surely attract the attention of great monsters. Remaining atop the city walls meant they were already sacrificing the combat power of the great sword immortal Lu Zhi.

Almost every sword cultivator from the Hidden Official’s line agreed and supported Pang Yuanji’s proposal.

Only Chen Ping'an did not consent, stating that there was no rush for now, and he had his own plans regarding when to move to the summer retreat.

In this matter, neither Dong Budu nor Deng Liang had any intention of continuing the debate. Both held differing opinions on the Hidden Official’s decision, voicing their dissent one after another.

Dong Budu emphasized that the Hidden Official’s line was too important, and staying on the horse-walking path risked being wiped out in one fell swoop.

Deng Liang lamented even more about the great sword immortal Lu Zhi remaining stationed there, which completely contradicted the Hidden Official’s line's principle of meticulousness and relentless pursuit.

Guo Zhujiu, unusually silent, lowered her head, wishing she could stare holes into the books and desks, her heart heavy.

And the girl’s silence itself was a form of attitude.

For Guo Zhujiu, who held the highest status in the world of her master, this was still an unprecedented action.

Yet Chen Ping'an still did not agree, providing additional reasons, but unable to truly convince everyone. Thus, the overall atmosphere among the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official’s line grew somewhat serious.

Afterward, the great sword immortal Yue Qing took the time to visit, halting at the edges of the sword qi barrier drawn by Mi Yu before continuing on.

Chen Ping'an immediately stood up and approached Yue Qing.

The two did not approach the other sword cultivators of the Hidden Official's line.

Yue Qing smiled and said, "Chen Ping'an, you need not worry about my face. I came this time not just to apologize to the disciples of the Confucian Sage but also to express my thanks to you—who is not just the Hidden Official."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "No need to stand on ceremony, I accept."

Yue Qing continued, "I previously criticized you regarding the Confucian Sage, and I did not hold back. Now that I’m here to apologize, naturally it feels a bit awkward. To be honest, if it were someone else in your position as the Hidden Official, no one would have dared to concern themselves with how I wield my sword. I would not be so polite."

Chen Ping'an replied, "As a candidate for the top ten sword immortals, you should have such boldness."

Yue Qing rubbed his chin and said, "You indeed handle matters decisively. I recognize that, but your way of speaking is truly not appealing to me."

Chen Ping'an passed a jug of wine to him.

Yue Qing laughed heartily, accepting the jug and leaving on his sword.

Chen Ping'an looked up, not withdrawing his gaze for a long time.

This was how a great sword immortal should be—standing firm on the bottom line, clear on likes and dislikes.

Returning to his seat, just as he sat down, Guo Jianlong said with a smile, "Hidden Official, don’t be stingy. You gave a jug of wine to Great Sword Immortal Yue; we, your own people, should not be treated any worse, right?"

Cao Jun laughed, "The wine in the jar is freshly brewed, truly invigorating."

Xuan Shen then chimed in, "I have yet to taste the immortal brew from the wine shop; it’s a regret in life. I hope to remedy that."

Guo Zhujiu slammed her palm on the table, "Pay up first!"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "There is indeed wine, but we can discuss that later. After killing a few earth immortal sword cultivators from the wild world, I’ll bring out a few jars of wine to celebrate."

The room erupted in noise.

Guo Jianlong and Wang Xinshui were the most enthusiastic.

Dong Budu did not even raise his head, clicking his tongue, "You’re quite bold."

Immediately, Guo Jianlong turned to Wang Xinshui, saying, "Xinshui, what’s wrong with you?"

Wang Xinshui looked innocent, "I’m just learning from you."

After this round of banter, the previously heavy atmosphere lightened somewhat.

Today, Chen Ping'an again rose to leave, walking to another part of the city wall.

Mi Yu had resigned himself, now finding himself a part of two more jokes, becoming the highest-ranked sword cultivator in the Hidden Official’s line, and then turning into the sycophantic follower of the young Hidden Official.

As he walked along, half-baked sword immortals would joke, "With Mi Brother here, why would we need Great Sword Immortal Lu to protect the Hidden Official's line?"

There were even insinuations that poked fun at the Hidden Official himself, "Mi Jianxian, you’re so free, just enjoying the scenery?"

Mi Yu looked at Chen Ping'an, who always wore a cheerful expression, wondering if this was what they called "spitting on one’s face and drying it off?"

Some of Guo Jianlong's fair comments were indeed fair and hit the nail on the head.

Once again, they passed by Lie Ji.

In between sheathing his sword and sipping wine, Lie Ji stood up upon seeing the two pass near the wall, taking out two jugs of wine from his belongings and tossing them to Mi Yu and Chen Ping'an, saying, "This is from the second shopkeeper."

Mi Yu caught the jug, which contained a snowflake money bamboo sea cave wine. Lie Ji was truly stingy even when flattering.

Chen Ping'an also reached out to catch the jug of bamboo sea cave wine.

In an instant.

An anomaly occurred.

A fierce red sword light suddenly shot out, the density of sword qi made the sword light appear almost dripping with vivid color.

It turned out to be Lie Ji's life-protecting flying sword "Burning Flower," aimed directly at the heart of the new Hidden Official, Chen Ping'an.

Mi Yu's heart was in turmoil; he directly crushed the wine jug and instantly summoned his life-protecting flying sword "Sky Full of Haze" to try to block Lie Ji’s flying sword.

Even if he couldn't completely stop it, he had to buy Chen Ping'an a chance to respond. No matter how heavy the injury, it was better than being pierced through the heart by Lie Ji’s direct attack. A sword immortal’s flying sword, aside from harming someone, would leave sword qi lingering in the enemy's acupoints, which was an immense trouble. 

Though Lie Ji and Mi Yu might be looked down upon by other sword immortals, Lie Ji's strike was imminent, and Chen Ping'an was completely defenseless, reaching out to accept that potentially lethal jug of wine. Mi Yu could only pray for Chen Ping'an's survival!

Mi Yu's life-protecting flying sword "Sky Full of Haze," even if it was slightly late, still managed to bump against the tail of "Burning Flower," causing the latter’s tip to deviate slightly from its aim at Chen Ping'an’s heart.

At the same time, Mi Yu stepped forward, drawing his sword as he rushed toward the flying sword that Lie Ji had launched.

Mi Yu’s sword was of extremely high quality, due to the gifts from his brother Mi Hu, while Lie Ji had neither a partner nor a teacher, his sword was merely an ordinary length sword from a sword shop.

After being slightly deflected by Mi Yu’s flying sword, Lie Ji's "Burning Flower" still charged ahead.

Chen Ping'an formed hand seals. Without the protection of his celestial-grade robe, he was now wearing a blue robe from the Ning family, along with a standard robe from the clothing shop. Especially the inner robe, which glimmered with precious light and rippled as it finally coalesced into a faint golden talisman—the Sword Lock Talisman.

However, the distance between Lie Ji and Chen Ping'an was simply too close, and with Lie Ji unleashing his life-protecting sword without holding anything back, the flying sword surged forth relentlessly. 

When the two swords clashed, a deafening explosion of sword light erupted before Chen Ping'an, creating a blinding display of brilliant colors. The splattered "Burning Flower" and "Sky Light" instantly shredded the robe from the clothing shop into pieces, and the flying sword "Burning Flower" entered the golden Sword Lock Talisman, causing it to develop cracks of ash, interlacing in all directions, clearly threatening to break through the talisman with a single push.

With the talisman’s assistance in stalling the flying sword's attack somewhat, Chen Ping'an summoned a movement talisman and retreated ten or so zhang.

All Chen Ping'an could do was cast another talisman to escape.

Two jade purity realm sword immortals' life-protecting flying swords were nearly shadowing each other, but "Sky Full of Haze" was to save a life, while "Burning Flower" sought to take one.

"Burning Flower" aimed to achieve the utmost speed, plunging an inch into Chen Ping'an's heart.

This was the deadly strike of a sword immortal at close range.

What was even more ruthless was that Lie Ji not only did not retract his flying sword but rather shattered his own life-protecting sword, risking his own foundational path.

Mi Yu's sword struck down on Lie Ji’s shoulder, slicing through his resilient body in half.

As Lie Ji's soul left his body, he abandoned his true form and aimed to use his sword shop's long sword to decapitate the new Hidden Official.

Simultaneously, after the explosion of his life-protecting flying sword within Chen Ping'an, Lie Ji's soul was also affected by his own technique. The relatively weaker soul of Yuan You seemed to bathe in the glow of Lie Ji's last sword, as man and sword, path and life, vanished into thin air together.

Mi Yu withdrew his life-protecting flying sword, holding his long sword without sheathing it for a long time.

Because Mi Yu knew that he had been severely harmed by this deranged Lie Ji.

From this moment on, whether he would be thrown into the old deaf man's prison still depended on whether his brother Mi Hu's immortal realm was sufficient to protect him.

Lu Zhi hurriedly arrived on his sword, his face ashen. Without even glancing at the dazed Mi Yu, he gritted his teeth and said, "You are truly a waste!"

Lu Zhi immediately formed sword seals, attempting to gather the remnants of the young Hidden Official's soul, seeking any possible chance for Chen Ping'an.

But it was all in vain.

Lie Ji's strike had been too decisive.

Lu Zhi turned his gaze toward the distant thatched cottage, mentally inquiring the Grand Sword Immortal.

Chen Qingdu said, "Let the troubled seedlings choose three sword cultivators to join him in entering the Hidden Official's line."

Lu Zhi furiously retorted, "Just like that?!"

Chen Qingdu replied, "You, Lu Zhi, have the nerve to ask me?"

Lu Zhi snapped, "Am I supposed to accompany Chen Ping'an everywhere? What about the safety of the other sword cultivators in the Hidden Official's line? How should Mi Yu be handled? Executed?!"

Chen Qingdu said, "We’ll talk about that later."

Lu Zhi suppressed the killing intent in his heart and brought Mi Yu back to the horse-walking path where the Hidden Official's line had gathered.

Upon seeing those younger disciples, Lu Zhi hesitated for a moment, an unprecedented act, before finally saying, "The Hidden Official was killed by the traitor Lie Ji, and Lie Ji is dead as well. Mi Yu is under suspicion and is to be detained temporarily. Troubled Seedling will bring three people into the Hidden Official's line. You must leave the city walls immediately and relocate to the summer retreat."

Guo Zhujiu laughed heartily, "Great Sword Immortal Lu, you certainly know how to tell jokes."

Lin Junbi and the others also appeared skeptical, exchanging glances.

Lu Zhi sighed, "That’s how it is. Leave the city walls and take care of yourselves."

With that, Lu Zhi departed.

Guo Zhujiu playfully asked, "Mi Jianxian, now that Lu Zhi has left, you shouldn't keep joking. Or else I might get angry…"

Though the girl smiled, tears were already welling up in her eyes. As she spoke, her expression tightened, and she found herself unable to utter another word.

Lin Junbi's emotions were extraordinarily complex.

This Hidden Official position was indeed not easy to hold.

Lie Ji, a jade purity realm sword immortal, was actually quite low on the roster in the original documents, only a few pages away from Mi Yu.

Yet precisely because of this, Lie Ji became the unexpected variable.

As for why Lie Ji acted this way, who could tell?

The historical grievances of the Sword Qi Great Wall were far too many, and almost none of the stories of sword immortals ended happily.

Dong Budu's face turned pale, clearly unable to accept this inexplicable outcome.

Guo Jianlong and Wang Xinshui clenched their fists, utterly unable to accept this matter.

Xuan Shen and other sword cultivators also fell silent, disheartened.

Soon, a young-looking sword immortal stepped forward, just over a hundred years old, a jade purity realm cultivator, praised as having the most stable cultivation in the past three thousand years of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

This person was Qiu Miao.

He had followed A Liang into the depths of the barbaric world.

Beside Qiu Miao was a Golden Core realm female sword cultivator, naturally charming, named Luo Zhenyi. She was around the same age as Qiu Miao and incredibly beautiful, beloved by many unattached sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Additionally, there was a young Golden Core realm sword cultivator, Xu Ning, who possessed two life-protecting flying swords, "White Practice" and "Mountain Color," which complemented each other.

There was also a Dragon Gate realm young sword cultivator, Chang Taiqing.

Compared to the dazzling peaks of Qi Shou and Gao Ye, the sword cultivators under Qiu Miao’s leadership, who spent their days in the large characters at the southern wall, had extraordinary composure, even the young sword cultivators appearing like ancient Buddhist monks or Daoist sages, their sword hearts dry and withered.

Qiu Miao said, "Mi Yu can stay by my side. The rest will move to the summer retreat together. Zhenyi, Ning, Taiqing, you three assist."

Mi Yu smiled bitterly.

Qiu Miao's meaning was simple: staying by his side meant Mi Yu could do nothing he wanted.

The first batch of sword cultivators from the Hidden Official's line, including Lin Junbi, silently began to relocate. There was no animosity toward the later sword cultivators, but there was also no goodwill.

In the end, they had unknowingly grown accustomed to Chen Ping'an's presence.

Only Guo Zhujiu remained behind, sitting dazedly, saying, "I won’t leave; I’ll wait for my master."

Qiu Miao replied, "That's fine. Whenever you feel you can’t wait any longer, go to the summer retreat to work."

Qiu Miao led the group, taking to the skies on their swords, heading toward the important location west of the city.

Only Guo Zhujiu was left behind, sitting alone at the desk.

All the sword cultivators landed on the plaza outside the summer retreat’s hall.

Qiu Miao paused for a moment.

No wonder he had not been immediately appointed as the new Hidden Official.

Qiu Miao did not care about this; in fact, whether he became the Hidden Official sword cultivator or stayed at the city walls to kill enemies, it made no difference to Qiu Miao, as it was all about cultivation.

The three sword cultivators, including Luo Zhenyi, were surprised.

As for Mi Yu, he was nearly moved to tears.

Lin Junbi sighed in relief.

That’s good.

Now, with this Hidden Official, they were all on the same rope, sharing honor and disgrace.

Compared to the unknown Qiu Miao, Lin Junbi preferred to work with this fellow before her.

It turned out that at the entrance to the hall, a young man in a blue robe with sleeves draped smiled at everyone.

His face was pale, yet his eyes sparkled.

Chen Ping'an waved to Mi Yu, "Come walk with me."

Then Chen Ping'an looked to Qiu Miao, "In the future, when I'm not around, I’ll trouble you four to listen to Lin Junbi’s opinions."

Qiu Miao nodded, "No problem."

Chen Ping'an turned to Guo Jianlong.

Guo Jianlong immediately understood, praising Qiu Miao, "Sword Immortal Qiu Miao, so grand and magnificent, can be testified by the sun and moon!"

Luo Zhenyi furrowed her brow.

Chen Ping'an had already taken Mi Yu into a side corridor, strolling toward another place.

The group entered the hall and soon discovered that all the secret records from the winter residence had already been moved here. The hall, aside from the entrance, now had three walls lined with bookshelves, orderly arranged. Many secret record books had labels attached, making it easy for everyone to pull and reference them. It was evident that this was the handiwork of the Hidden Official, written in a neat and precise small script.

Chen Ping'an remained silent.

Mi Yu felt a surge of emotions and also said nothing.

Chen Ping'an took out his sword nurturing gourd and retrieved a jug of bamboo sea cave wine, handing it to Mi Yu.

Mi Yu bitterly remarked, "I fear this wine."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "There are a thousand kinds of drinkers, but only wine is faultless. But it’s fine to drink. If you have questions, just ask."

Mi Yu inquired, "What happened? Who is the Hidden Official up there on the city walls?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "It's a high-quality substitute talisman, plus a puppetry technique, a truly solid golden body warrior’s physique. With the help of the Grand Sword Immortal to shield some things, it’s rather discreet. But if it were only that, it certainly wouldn’t fool you, Mi Yu, which means it probably wouldn't fool Lie Ji either. So, I attached a part of my soul to the talisman puppet. Up there on the city walls, 'I' must carefully control every step and breath, and right now, I'm quite injured, and it's not an act. However, paying this little price unearthed an unexpected traitor, and he was a sword immortal, so it’s worth it. In fact, the person I wanted to fish out wasn’t initially Lie Ji; there was someone else. As for who, you’ve been following me closely, there are traces to follow, but I estimate you’ve forgotten."

Mi Yu tentatively asked, "What you said earlier about 'in case,' was that a setup to lure out a big fish like Yang Zhi or Huang Luan? Were you anticipating this ambush from the start?"

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Our sword cultivators can send messages to the wild world in secret; naturally, the other side can also send messages back to the Sword Qi Great Wall. As for why Lie Ji betrayed us, whether it’s due to more resentment towards the Haoran world or a greater grievance against the Grand Sword Immortal, or even if he bears hatred for the entire Sword Qi Great Wall, there must be reasons. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been so decisive in his attack; however, the intricacies within this, I’m not interested. In any case, Lie Ji is dead."

Chen Ping'an emphasized, "People like him should die sooner rather than later. Otherwise, he might truly drag one or two great sword immortals down with him at a critical moment."

Mi Yu halted, his face extremely grim. "I was pulled into the Hidden Official's line just for this day, for this matter?!"

Chen Ping'an also stopped, nodding and speaking frankly, "Not only to pull you into the fold but also to invite Lu Zhi. It’s essentially the same. Truth and falsehood, reality and illusion; without this strategy, how could I deceive a scheming sword immortal? With a sword immortal harboring betrayal in his heart, their minds become exceptionally sharp. Lu Zhi is protecting all of us in the Hidden Official’s line. Unless a sword immortal at the immortal realm comes near me for a close-range strike, there’s no opportunity. Otherwise, anyone attempting to attack would be deluding themselves. With this premise, when I leave Lu Zhi’s side, it creates the illusion of missing out on a rare opportunity."

At this point, Chen Ping'an leaned against the corridor pillar, shaking the sword nurturing gourd in his hand, smiling broadly, "It’s a great opportunity; it would be a pity to miss it. We could try it out."

"Lu Zhi's protection and vigilance are merely a façade for others to see. The Hidden Official is exceptionally secure, with no life-threatening worries. Once I leave Lu Zhi’s side, the absence of a jade purity realm Mi Yu beside me becomes a necessary hint. Otherwise, the assassin would worry I’m too confident and suspect there’s a plot at play. Not carrying a sword of celestial-grade quality and not wearing a celestial-grade robe, is also a reasonable approach. Thus, without the robe, and without a reliable sword immortal like Mi Yu to guard me, the Hidden Official’s true reliance becomes solely on being within the Sword Qi Great Wall and his own golden body warrior physique."

Mi Yu gulped down a mouthful of wine, still remaining silent.

Chen Ping'an said, "Once the Hidden Official dies, it’s only natural for morale to wane, and my sword formation will be affected. Therefore, we can fish even better now. Compared to killing a sword immortal, this is the outcome I desire most."

Mi Yu stared blankly at this young man.

Chen Ping'an laughed, "In fact, I've thought of a lot, and most of it truly is just thinking, without any real use."

Mi Yu had never been good at pondering such grand matters. Even regarding his stagnation in cultivation, his brother Mi Hu had been anxious for many years, but Mi Yu himself had always been more open-minded. Thus, he only asked the question he most wanted to know, "If you hold a grudge against someone from the Sword Qi Great Wall, wouldn't you not even know how they died in the end?"

Chen Ping'an was taken aback for a moment, then thought seriously for a while before nodding, "I should be able to do that, but I’ve never thought about it. Because for me, it’s not worth the loss. A piece of Dao heart is hard to come by; having been poor since childhood, I’ve grown accustomed to cherishing rare things."

Mi Yu's gaze suddenly sharpened. "For example, the Qi family, who made things difficult for the Ning family back in the day?! Do you hate them? Truly not a bit of personal interest? In that thirteen-driven dispute, after you became the Hidden Official, you’ve surely seen all the archived records. You must have found traces of key words spoken by certain sword immortals at specific times; you know much more about the filthy inside story!"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Mi Brother, you guess."

Chen Ping'an handed over the sword nurturing gourd, but Mi Yu’s wine jug remained still. Chen Ping'an looked helpless and said, "In any case, I'm not the kind of person who holds grudges, on my conscience."

Mi Yu seemed even more dispirited than Chen Ping'an, who had suffered soul damage. His spirit was utterly drained, and he casually asked, "That girl Guo Zhujiu is still up there on the city walls. When will you notify her to come back?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Wait a little longer."

Mi Yu shook his head, "Calculating and scheming, you even won’t let a little girl off. That Guo Zhujiu is your disciple! Even if you have good intentions, I still find it quite strange, Chen Ping'an. Aren’t you exhausted? Not a shred of guilt?"

Chen Ping'an countered, "Is it enough to only seek to be guiltless to oneself? Do you think Lie Ji was guiltless? A dignified sword immortal, he even sacrificed his own life. What kind of grievances and guilt must he have harbored?"

Mi Yu had no retort.

Chen Ping'an looked up at the southern city wall, laughing, "Burning Flower, Burning Flower, what a fine name—‘Mountain Green and Flower Ready to Burn.’ Sword immortals are indeed skilled at naming their life-protecting flying swords."

The two returned to the hall of the summer retreat.

Mi Yu took his seat.

Chen Ping'an did not sit down but instead settled on the steps outside the door.

Chen Ping'an merely said, "Aside from the Hidden Official line’s flying swords, no one is allowed to leave the summer retreat even a step. No private meetings with outsiders are permitted. If anyone is found, they will be executed for treason. Moreover, our Hidden Official line’s message-carrying flying swords, Qiu Miao and the four of them, along with Lin Junbi and the twelve others, must all know the contents of the messages, line by line, word by word, and Mi Yu Jianxian must record them."

Xu Ning looked up at the figure outside the door, asking, "If you don’t trust us, why pull us into the Hidden Official line?"

Chen Ping'an, holding the sword nurturing gourd in one hand and a folding fan in the other, said, "Before you speak to me, first respectfully address me as Hidden Official."

Xu Ning really did add "Hidden Official" before repeating that sentence.

Only then did Chen Ping'an smile and say something incredibly frank: "If I can't even trust myself, how can I trust you?"

Xu Ning fell silent, while Luo Zhenyi and Chang Taiqing suddenly raised their heads, expressions full of anger.

Xuan Shen and Cao Jun, who deeply revered the Hidden Official, being outsiders among the sword cultivators, were even more direct than Guo Jianlong and Wang Xinshui. The two young people did not conceal their allegiance.

Qiu Miao said, "Less talk among the crowd. If there’s nothing to do, return early. If there’s work, let’s get to it. Since the four of us have become sword cultivators of the Hidden Official line, everything will follow the rules."

Chen Ping'an turned his head and smiled, "If I were to die, Qiu Miao sword immortal, you and Junbi would indeed be the best candidates for the Hidden Official."

Lin Junbi feigned deafness.

Qiu Miao acted as though he had heard nothing.

In the night, a message-carrying flying sword flew toward the city wall, after which appeared a heartbroken young girl who slowly flew over, her face sorrowful, constantly wiping her tears.

After gracefully landing, her movements were still a bit unsteady.

Upon seeing her master, who had already risen, she immediately beamed.

Chen Ping'an gently smiled, "You’ve come a bit late."

Guo Zhujiu sheathed her sword, standing in front of Chen Ping'an, excitedly bouncing in place with her arms swaying, her eyes sparkling, "Master, let me tell you! Earlier, I was the only one who believed my master wouldn’t die. I just didn’t expect you to be so powerful, not only alive and well but you even managed to fool me! I couldn’t even break through my small brain to think that you were already in the summer retreat. Unbelievable, truly incredible…"

"I said as long as my master is here, you don’t have to think about life and death. It should always be like this; I’m willing to believe in my master."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, reaching into his belongings to pull out a small bamboo box, "This is a reward for you. If it’s not too heavy, carry it. But you mustn't show off to others."

Guo Zhujiu lifted the small bamboo box, softly asking, "Master, what’s this bamboo box? Did it get some spirit and come to find you? Fine, when my elder sister gave me this bamboo box, it transformed into a spirit. Later, Master, you can make a regular box without legs and gift it to my elder sister. This one that has grown into a small bamboo box will belong to me."

Chen Ping'an shook his head, laughing, "You can negotiate with Pei Qian later; Master won’t show favoritism."

Chen Ping'an ruffled Guo Zhujiu’s hair, "Off you go; don’t delay important matters."

Guo Zhujiu bounced up the steps and then suddenly turned around, jumping backward, facing the hall, standing still for a moment before finally turning and stepping forward.

Chen Ping'an did not follow into the hall but continued strolling through the summer retreat.

Every place he walked was a small world.

Chen Ping'an plucked a blue talisman from his belongings, gently shaking it, saying, "The Grand Sword Immortal won’t let you go back empty-handed. In the near future, any sword immortal attempting to spy on the summer retreat will be killed directly. Those willing to take such risks are not patient enough; they won’t hold much value for us at the Sword Qi Great Wall."

After pausing for a moment, Chen Ping'an added, "If such a contribution comes knocking, it would best be placed on the shoulders of the head of our Hidden Official line, Sword Immortal Mi Yu."

Even though Chen Ping'an was speaking in his own small world, to Chen Qingdu, it was as insubstantial as paper.

Though Chen Qingdu neither agreed nor refused, the meaning was quite clear: having chosen you, Chen Ping'an, as the Hidden Official, feel free to make your own moves.

This old great sword immortal changed the topic, asking again, "Have you really thought this through? If it is indeed you, will you not regret it? Will you not clarify things with Ning Yao first?"

Chen Ping'an did not answer, also changing the topic, "How is my senior brother doing?"

Chen Qingdu replied that he was doing fine.

Chen Ping'an then put away the talisman, hiding it in his sleeve. He switched to a different talisman, gently twisting it and silently reciting the incantation, instantly arriving at the other winter residence.

In the summer retreat, there was a towering ancient tree, the green tree bringing coolness in autumn.

The standout feature of this residence was a scepter inscribed with poetic verses, shaped like a fish tail yet resembling a fungus.

Chen Ping'an walked alone through the massive courtyard.

Both residences were quite simplistic inside, lacking any unnecessary embellishments.

Chen Ping'an planned to familiarize himself with this environment first.

Before leaving this silent residence and returning to the summer retreat, Chen Ping'an murmured to himself, "I’m ready. I’m coming."

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 742: A Gentle Breeze Under the Soft Moon (Part 1)

The Hanging Mountain originally had only one grand gate leading to the Sword Qi Great Wall, but now a larger entrance had been opened, leaving the old gate much less bustling.

To put it in the words of the sword-wielding man, it was a case of "loving the new and hating the old," which had truly hurt people's hearts.

An exceptionally senior little Taoist boy remained seated, engrossed in a book. He was reading a collection of miscellaneous writings by a disheartened scholar. With a casual gesture, he conjured a handful of silvery moonlight to envelop himself and the book, illuminating the pages like fireflies in the night.

Last time, he had been thoroughly disgusted by that white-clad youth whose head had been caught in a door and then kicked by a donkey. What could have been a beautiful tale of talented scholars and fair maidens in the Pinewood Collection had been twisted by that boy into a censored version of a romantic novel. As a result, he had spent several days unable to recover, feeling demotivated to read anything, and was left with no choice but to abandon this rare pleasure and simply daydream.

However, after enduring a month without reading, boredom had driven him to pick up a stack of books, diving headfirst into them day and night, utterly mesmerized.

Though the little Taoist boy was a being of divine nature, he read slowly and meticulously. Even with an exceptional memory, he frequently flipped back to earlier pages just to take another glance.

On the other side of the gate, the sword-wielding man, holding his long sword, wandered over to the little Taoist boy. Realizing this could be considered slacking off, he quickly returned, resting the sword against a pillar before grabbing a jug of wine and returning to squat beside the little boy, leaning in to read along. The little Taoist boy preferred to enjoy his reading alone and disliked the smell of alcohol, so he turned away, and the man followed suit, understanding just how bored a sword cultivator could be after years of solitude. They settled into this routine.

The man pointed to a line in the book, saying, “This scholar in the book has some skill, ‘The mountains are clear, the waters are beautiful, the essence of heaven and earth all belongs to the beauty. We men come to this world merely to ruin the mountains and rivers and betray the beauties.’ This line is wonderfully written. It deserves to be highlighted and memorized.”

The little Taoist boy had grown accustomed to the man’s rambling and continued flipping through his book, while the man babbled away without bothering about the boy’s reading pace.

After finishing a book, the man sighed, “Boring, without a hint of spice.”

The little Taoist boy put down his book and picked up another—this one was an adventure novel about dark nights and high winds, depicting martial artists leaping across rooftops. Whenever the man found something exciting, he would take a swig of wine, but his eyes remained glued to the pages, not missing a single word. He clicked his tongue in admiration, “As expected of that little heavenly genius chosen by the heavens, he picks up the unparalleled martial arts that would take others a lifetime to comprehend in just one night. I truly envy him. What a pity the incantation for this technique was written so vaguely; otherwise, I could give it a try…”

“See? I told you, this scruffy old man who loves to spout nonsense is definitely a hidden master! How about that? I was right, right? The old man really looks upon our little genius with admiration. Wow, what a grand gesture! Not only did he use a lifetime’s worth of internal energy to help him open up his meridians, but he also thoroughly cleansed his marrow. Goodness, if he returns to the martial world, wouldn’t he be invincible?”

The book was only halfway through when the little Taoist boy, with a serious tone, interjected, “Clearly, he is not invincible yet, even with a sudden windfall of a lifetime's worth of internal energy added to his own twenty years of training, he only has eighty years of internal energy. There’s a foreshadowing in the story; a notorious demon who has stirred up a bloodbath in the martial world has already cultivated for a hundred years, his internal energy is pure and unfathomable—he cannot be defeated.”

The man stroked his chin, finding it reasonable, “Then he still lacks a weapon that can cut through steel like mud. But I doubt he’ll get his hands on one too quickly; after all, the story is only halfway through.”

The little Taoist boy turned the page slowly, rarely agreeing with the man, “What’s the rush? He’ll definitely get one, otherwise, how could he even fight?”

The man took a hearty swig of wine, “A childhood sweetheart, a righteous female hero encountered in the martial world, a demonic beauty with whom he has a love-hate relationship—none can be missing!”

It was likely that the author, who was simply thinking about earning a bit of money for food and ink, could never imagine that there were two readers so immersed in the story.

Moreover, both readers were “shallow” in their understanding, yet they had genuine affection for the tale.

One was a master whose name was taboo across the land, seeking to learn from the ancient true immortals how to manipulate the elements, grasp the yin and yang, move mountains, and part seas, to breathe in harmony with the universe.

The other was a grand sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall, who had participated in the fierce battles of the Thirteen Struggles and had formed bonds with many heroes, including a female sword immortal.

The little Taoist boy, hailing from an illustrious family and possessing a prestigious lineage, had left his hometown in the Celestial Realm to toughen himself and sharpen his Dao heart.

In contrast, the man could be considered a prisoner among prisoners, forced to guard the gate behind them year after year.

The little Taoist boy closed his book, prompting the man to ask in irritation, “What’s the matter?”

The little Taoist boy replied, “Let’s take it slow; this book is quite good. Read it more carefully.”

The book contained a scene that didn’t describe mountains or immortals but focused on the people of the martial world. In just a few strokes, it allowed the little Taoist boy, who had never truly wandered the martial world, to visualize the narrative.

After the rain, the sky cleared, mist rising from the water, hazy and ethereal. In the heart of the lake was a colorful boat, where a hero stood at the bow, cutting through the water. As it approached the pavilion, the reeds along the path rustled, while inside the pavilion, a guest in white brewed wine, waiting to resolve life and death over a drunken duel.

The man sighed, reclining back, casually asking, “Jiang Daojun, what kind of place is the Celestial Realm?”

The little Taoist boy answered, “It has its customs and rules, similar to this vast world of righteousness.”

The man inquired, “Has Daoist Lao Er gathered five hundred spirit officials yet?”

The little Taoist boy didn’t think this was any secret, “Probably still early. Changing shells and continuing to establish the Daoist temple isn’t easy.”

The man rested his hands behind his head in a comfortable position, crossing his legs, “Everyone is busy.”

The little Taoist boy laughed, “We’re not busy.”

The man gazed at the bright moon, “But we’re still burning the midnight oil.”

A-Liang had once left behind a saying at the Sword Qi Great Wall: those who cannot stay up late will never cultivate any great path.

As for how to stay up late?

The laborious practice of refining Qi and swords is fundamental.

Drinking is the middle ground; even if one runs out of money for wine, the moonlight pouring into the cup costs nothing, and the cup never runs dry.

As for what is above?

Gamblers and drunks, all men, shared a knowing smile.

The little Taoist boy found it odd and turned to the man, “Zhang Lu, are you really this lackluster? The situation at the Sword Qi Great Wall is tense; if you insist on returning to the city wall, Chen Qing wouldn’t stop you, would he?”

The man named Zhang Lu closed his eyes to rest, saying, “I’m just tired.”

The little Taoist boy laughed, “With that mindset, it’ll be hard for you to improve further.”

Zhang Lu softly replied, “Whatever.”

The little Taoist boy waved away the moonlight that resembled a desk lamp, looking up at the sky, “The true flavor of the world can only be tasted by the tranquil.”

“Did your master teach you that?”

“I read it in miscellaneous writings.”

“Jiang Yunsheng, you say when a man sees insult, he draws his sword and stands up to fight, but forgets life and death—is that good?”

“I don’t know, don’t care to think about it.”

“There’s no banquet that doesn’t end, I’ll think of you in the future, and I’ll find you in your hometown to have fun.”

“A big man saying this to another big man, who are you trying to disgust?!” 

“You just look like a child; you’re not that big yet.”

“Zhang Lu, are you looking for a beating?!”

The man turned on his side and fell fast asleep.

If in the vast world of righteousness, even a grand sword immortal in a dire state wouldn’t end up with such a meager existence.

The little Taoist boy continued reading.

Pity the sword immortal Shao Yunyan.

Business, earning silver, never stops day or night.

Every piece of celestial money is praised as the most refined essence of spiritual energy in the world, but whether a single clean piece exists is hard to say.

A massive ferry unloaded goods and exchanged supplies for the Sword Qi Great Wall before departing from the Hanging Mountain dock.

This was a cross-regional ferry from the Southwest Fuyun Continent, specifically from the Mountain Water Cave’s major sect. The ferry had a very rustic name—Basin.

It was said that the founder of the Mountain Water Cave started from humble beginnings in the marketplace, but after making his fortune, he spent his life distancing himself from the past and living on the mountain like a feudal lord. The only time he revealed his true self was when naming the cross-regional ferry—the Basin.

A ferry overseer, a Nascent Soul cultivator, stood on the observation deck of the ferry, silently calculating. This round trip to the Hanging Mountain could at least yield seventy grain rain coins, and with the major dynasties in Fuyun Continent embroiled in chaos, if everything went smoothly and the right buyers were found, doubling the profits was not out of the question.

Meanwhile, because of several newly emerged celestial treasures, there were already more than three semi-celestial weapons on the mountain, leading to bloody conflicts, and many earth immortals had perished. Numerous old tortoises from the upper five realms were also gradually surfacing. If not for the constraints of the Confucian Academy, these old immortals would not remain in the shadows. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be merely puppets pulling strings in such a harmonious manner.

Regardless of the mountains and the plains, such exhausting conflicts were beneficial for the top-tier commercial sects like the Mountain Water Cave.

The Qionglin Sect was wealthy due to the influx of sword cultivators from the Northern Julu Continent, leading to rapid turnover of celestial sects. Once the tide turned, celestial money naturally flowed like water.

Calculating and counting, every bead that rolled was money.

As for the Liu family of the Aiai Continent, they were unique; they could deal with anyone. Many transactions had moved beyond the realm of mere finance; paying money earned them the rise and fall of dynasties, the replacement of powerful families in the celestial realm.

The most frightening part was that the Liu family's principle in any transaction was to ensure the other party could profit first. Even more terrifying was that this principle became an unbreakable family rule, passed down through generations.

The old cultivator returned from this trip to the Hanging Mountain with considerable gains. As the overseer of the Mountain Water Cave's cross-regional ferry, he had received guidance from the founder. Earlier, he had booked several top-tier rooms at the Lingzhi Pavilion and planned to exchange insights with fellow cultivators from Fuyun and Jinjia continents, aiming to join forces for profit. In total, eight cross-regional ferries were to be involved, focusing on profits; otherwise, they would merely give the Sword Qi Great Wall’s Yan family and Nalan family the chance to compare prices and lower them.

This was merely the first matter, with hardly any dissent. The Mountain Water Cave was financially robust and determined to push this initiative, willing to guarantee that after the next transaction, everyone would profit and be happy, proving the feasibility of this method. In the future, they would follow this pattern for the Hanging Mountain. However, if someone ended up in the red, the Mountain Water Cave would compensate them.

The second matter was the current battle at the Sword Qi Great Wall, which was incredibly difficult and required substantial supplies. The Mountain Water Cave took the lead, proposing a plan to collaboratively build several new ferries, hire the old ancestors to help open one or two smoother new routes, eliminate roadblocks, and assist in manning the ferries. Previously, they hadn’t acted because of limited funds, but with the change in circumstances, now that they had sufficient grain rain coins, even if these old ancestors looked down on it, they all had sects, lineages, and families to care for. As long as their respective sect leaders made a case to them with reason and sentiment, there was still hope to persuade these old seniors to step into the mundane.

The third matter was trickier; the two Nascent Soul sword cultivators, Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan, had gone to the city wall, leaving family affairs to the younger generations. Although they were far from as shrewd as the two financial masters of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the trouble was that this group of people would cling to prices and stubbornly stick to rules. If they refused, both sides would be at a standstill. While everyone knew the Sword Qi Great Wall could not outlast the cross-regional ferry, the longer they stayed at the Hanging Mountain, the more celestial money would flow away, which was no small amount. Thus, not only the Mountain Water Cave, but all cross-regional ferries hoped to break the deadlock.

Historically, during the Great War at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Nalan family had not hesitated to threaten several cross-regional ferries that insisted on high prices, threatening them to either sell or leave.

Just when these ferry overseers were about to bow their heads and concede, a sudden turn of events occurred. An obscure young man aboard a ferry from Fuyun managed to unite and persuade all ferry overseers from the Seven Continents' sects, declaring that they would withdraw from the Hanging Mountain without profit, as if they were going on a leisurely outing, docking at the Rain Dragon Sect's affiliated island dock, leaving only a message for the Sword Qi Great Wall: they would not earn this money.

This young man, who gained fame and ultimately helped all ferries make a fortune, was none other than the founder of the Mountain Water Cave. At that time, he was merely a Sea Observation Realm cultivator but managed to persuade all the seasoned merchants, earning immense respect. Just thirty years later, he had established his own faction along with cross-regional ferries.

The Nalan family had considered targeting the two cross-regional ferries from the Mountain Water Cave, but time and again, they had handled them effortlessly. Over time, what else could be done? Business continued.

Later, the Yan family emerged, with the patriarch Yan Ming being more amicable than the forthright traders of the Nalan family. He was more like a shrewd businessman, diligently helping the Sword Qi Great Wall save unnecessary expenses, allowing all cross-regional ferries to earn profits, creating a mutually beneficial relationship. After Nalan Caihuan took over the family's financial power, the relationship with the various ferries was also not bad. With both Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan taking charge of commerce, the relationship between both sides was generally one of mutual non-interference, though there would occasionally be minor conflicts of interest.

An old cultivator’s direct disciple arrived at the observation deck, hesitating to speak.

The old Nascent Soul smiled, “Just say what you want to say.”

The young man asked, “Master, in the past, our Mountain Water Cave ferries agreed with Sword Qi Great Wall to allow credit; after the war, we would settle the debts at the agreed interest, paying less if returned early and more if late. Why does the old ancestor want us to partner with the other ferries to reject this matter?”

The old man gently replied, “Although the Sword Qi Great Wall keeps a tight lid on information, preventing anyone from approaching the city wall—even old acquaintances like me, who used to stay at the sword immortal’s residence for days—this time, once we entered the Sword Qi Great Wall, we couldn't even get into the city, only negotiating business with members of the two families in the mansions between the city and the mirage. The more they conceal, the more it proves that the demon tribe is coming in full force, and this battle at the Sword Qi Great Wall will be brutal. You tell me, how solid are the Yan and Nalan families?”

The young man chuckled, “Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan, both sword immortals, are surely astute. Their accumulated wealth, whether their own or helping the Sword Qi Great Wall, must be considerable.”

The old man nodded, smiling, “So, this time, we can help the Mountain Water Cave earn a lot more. Not only do we intend to dig out their wealth completely, but we also want to empty their alchemy workshops. As for not allowing credit, we’ll be serious about it—this is no joke—but in reality, it doesn’t have to be taken seriously. How we don't take it seriously would depend on the sincerity of Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan.”

The young man cautiously said, “The sword immortals have quite good tempers; we mustn’t push them into a corner.”

The old man scoffed, “Nalan family has that old ancestor Nalan Shao'wei, one of the top ten sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall. If we were in our Fuyun Continent, who would dare breathe loudly in front of such an old monster? Nalan Shao'wei has a good temper? Not at all. But when it comes to us, what can he do if he has a bad temper? The sword immortal’s killing power is immense, and he enjoys killing? Let him do as he pleases; do they dare?

Next, we will also persuade the old ancestors of other ferries to come out of their seclusion. Thus, celestial money truly is the strongest fist in the world.”

The young man genuinely wanted to ask why they couldn't earn a little less money and didn't always have to squeeze the Sword Qi Great Wall for every last coin, as it seemed unnecessary.

The old man seemed to see through his disciple's thoughts and laughed, “You, your cultivation is fine, but in business, you are utterly clueless and lack wisdom! If you can clearly earn money, yet think about earning less, do you really think you can earn big bucks in this lifetime? As long as you think like that, you’ll never become a person like our old ancestor. Don’t even dream of it; you’re not worthy of even carrying his shoes.”

Finally, the old man said, “You should mind your own business and live well; that’s already impressive. When you become a more important figure in the Mountain Water Cave than me one day, then you’ll have the qualification to talk about earning less. But I can assure you, when that day comes, you’ll want to earn even more than I do. Looking back on today’s thoughts, you’ll find them ridiculous! Why?”

The old man answered himself, “Because you’ll be sitting on the seat of the Mountain Water Cave’s ancestral hall.”

Fu Ke, the youngest Golden Core Earth Immortal in the history of the Rain Dragon Sect, left the ancestral mountain of the sect today to visit a vassal island and meet a friend.

The Rain Dragon Sect itself did not possess cross-regional ferries, as it was unnecessary; with over twenty vassal islands, each with its own docks, and a multitude of sects affiliated with the Rain Dragon Sect, including inner and outer disciples and miscellaneous workers, there were tens of thousands of people.

The vast majority of cross-regional ferries from the Northern Julu Continent and some from the Southern Posa Continent needed to stop here midway.

Fu Ke did not bring a companion; he steered his talisman boat alone to a place called Jade Island. The island was home to celestial trees, precious as jade, sought after by many cross-regional ferries. After making a fortune at the Hanging Mountain, he didn’t lack for this expense, and besides, upon returning home, he would still earn money and enhance his status.

Jade Island was located in the northeast of the Rain Dragon Sect, so in earlier years, one could often see the old rain-dispensing dragons traveling between Jiao Long Ditch and the Southern Posa Continent. If lucky, one might even see a weary dragon struggling to return to the sea. The Rain Dragon Sect had always treated these dragons, following their nature to bring clouds and rain, with kindness. Whenever an exhausted dragon surfaced, unable to return to its lair, a great cultivator would help it navigate the waters back to Jiao Long Ditch.

However, in recent years, such sightings had become rare due to a sword immortal of high skill and poor temper who, seeking fame, had indiscriminately destroyed much of the dragons’ nests. Some long-time residents of Jade Island commented that this sword immortal, despite his prowess, lacked understanding of human interactions, embodying the classic case of virtue not matching position.

Fu Ke was perhaps the most qualified to speak on these rumors, but he chose not to spoil the excitement for his own people.

Fu Ke's talisman boat didn’t head directly to his friend’s private residence, instead landing respectfully at the mountain gate on Jade Island, then slowly making his way. As he walked, he greeted those he encountered. Anyone who exchanged words with Fu Ke, even just casual pleasantries, felt both surprised and honored.

To Fu Ke, this was a minor affair that served two purposes: it helped deepen his approachable image and gave his friend a bit of face. On the mountain and in the plains, it was almost the same; face could be exchanged for money.

Fu Ke’s friend, Yu Fujing, was a fifth realm cultivator with a bit of fame in the Baoping Continent. He and Fu Ke had a long-standing friendship, starting from similar beginnings in their early years. Who would have thought that Fu Ke, who seemed to be at the end of his rope, would eventually find such great fortune in trying to see the Hanging Mountain? Instead of merely seeing the Hanging Mountain, he ended up at the Rain Dragon Sect, climbing the ranks to become a favored son-in-law of the sect, with two heavenly maidens falling for him one after another.

Such a profound opportunity was truly enviable, and his romantic fortune was even more so, enough to make others green with envy.

This news quickly spread back to Baoping Continent with the return of the ferry from Laolong City to Guihua Island, and Fu Ke became a figure admired by many cultivators, making even the immortal masters jealous.

Thus, Yu Fujing had come hoping for luck, initially just wishing to squeeze out a few celestial coins from his good friend Fu Ke, perhaps just a few small grains, to help him out.

Little did he expect that Fu Ke would indeed show loyalty. After Yu Fujing cautiously left the ferry and ventured toward the Rain Dragon Sect, he dared not step onto the island but only reported his name, saying he knew Fu Ke, even feeling too embarrassed to say he was Fu Ke's friend.

Fu Ke, unable to delay any longer due to the sect’s rules that prevented him from bringing Yu Fujing onto the island, settled Yu Fujing on Jade Island, assuring him to rest easy and not rush back to Baoping Continent. After Fu Ke left, Yu Fujing felt both fortunate and regretful. He was thankful that Fu Ke had not explicitly stated anything. The next day, however, the law-keeper cultivator from Jade Island’s ancestral hall personally came to inquire if he wished to become an inner disciple of Jade Island. Though not a direct descendant of the ancestral hall, this alone made Yu Fujing tearfully grateful. 

While Jade Island was a vassal of the Rain Dragon Sect, it was still guarded by a Nascent Soul old immortal! What kind of celestial mansion would that be in his hometown of Baoping Continent?

Moreover, the law-keeper cultivator was a Golden Core Earth Immortal. For someone like Yu Fujing, a fifth realm wild cultivator, even dreaming of the slightest smile or polite word from a Golden Core Earth Immortal was beyond what he could hope for.

After that, Yu Fujing began his stable practice on Jade Island as a registered cultivator, receiving the celestial master’s techniques. Though his aptitude was average and his progress was slow, he still received special attention from the ancestral hall cultivators.

Fu Ke’s visit to Jade Island was evidently to see his friend Yu Fujing.

Having already learned the news from his sect, Yu Fujing hurriedly left his dwelling. He thought about the futility of cultivating Qi when there was no extraordinary fate or significant celestial money to invest; just sitting there hoping was akin to waiting for death.

However, Yu Fujing suddenly paused at the door, hesitating for a long time before finally opening it. After a brief wait, he spotted Fu Ke, who was saying farewell to the old ancestor of Jade Island.

Yu Fujing quickened his pace, hoping to at least share a few words with the Nascent Soul immortal. The island’s master, the old Nascent Soul, indeed stopped.

Yu Fujing rushed forward and playfully slapped Fu Ke’s shoulder, jokingly scolding him for forgetting his brothers now that he had a wife. Fu Ke smiled and said nothing.

Yu Fujing then respectfully bowed to the old ancestor.

The old Nascent Soul exchanged a few courteous words with Yu Fujing, mostly about diligent cultivation and the hope for the Dao, while Yu Fujing listened intently. After the old Nascent Soul departed with a smile, Yu Fujing pulled Fu Ke into his modest private residence—though small, it was still a private dwelling. Jade Island had strict rules, and aside from the promising young talents destined to become pillars of the ancestral hall, Yu Fujing was the only fifth realm cultivator with a private residence.

Yu Fujing invited Fu Ke to drink.

Fu Ke took out three jugs of celestial wine brewed by the Rain Dragon Sect, giving one to Yu Fujing and keeping one for himself while leaving the last one for his master. Fu Ke smiled, saying his master loved good wine and that he would bring some back for him later.

Yu Fujing gave a thumbs up, “So righteous.”

Fu Ke grinned, “Wine is fine to drink, but remember not to get drunk; this wine is potent. If you like it, I’ll make sure to have someone deliver it to Jade Island even if I can’t come myself.”

Yu Fujing teased, “Isn’t that a bit lofty? Fu Ke, have you looked down on your fifth realm friend since becoming an Earth Immortal?”

Fu Ke sighed, “What nonsense! I’m just at a small bottleneck and need to enter seclusion for a while; I can’t get away.”

Yu Fujing took a sip of wine and propped his foot up on a chair, looking outside, sighing, “I never would have thought I’d be sitting here with you drinking this ridiculously expensive celestial wine.”

Fu Ke chuckled, “Such is the unpredictability of the Dao. Cheers!”

Yu Fujing drank quickly, and Fu Ke couldn’t stop him.

While Yu Fujing had once been filled with gratitude for Fu Ke, as Fu Ke climbed higher and higher, he came to see Fu Ke as almost perfect, and thus thoughts began to creep in.

There were profits to be made.

Fu Ke had left behind a troublesome past, as if he had never had that mountain-down relationship, soaring to heights and marrying beauties, becoming a direct descendant of the Rain Dragon Sect, seemingly completely forgetting those he had left behind.

Yu Fujing, of course, didn’t dare threaten Fu Ke, who was both a friend and an Earth Immortal.

Thus, during today’s drinking gathering, Yu Fujing spoke casually, almost letting something slip. A seemingly light remark was woven into their reminiscing.

Fu Ke set down the wine jug.

Yu Fujing slapped himself, instantly regretting, “What am I saying! Fu Ke, don’t think too much about it; I swear I won’t mention this to outsiders!”

Fu Ke chuckled.

Then, Yu Fujing fell silent.

Fu Ke picked up the wine jug and continued to drink slowly, staring at the door, muttering to himself, “Yu Fujing, you come looking for me to gamble on wealth, and I leave the Rain Dragon Sect to row a boat to see you, giving you a fortune you’ve never dared to dream of. If you behave well and know your place, perhaps there will still be some chance for you to become my right-hand man. After all, realm is realm, and intellect is intellect. I’ve always known you are a clever man; if you choose to squander your fortune, then I can’t be blamed for severing our brotherly ties.”

“You are merely a fifth realm cultivator who has never seen the view from the mountain peak, while I have seen it with my own eyes. Face and reputation are things I desire as long as it’s possible. But when two harms must be weighed, I find you to be an insatiable wolf. Rather than keep you around to bring misfortune upon myself, it’s better to resolve things early. The reason I keep you here is to remind myself, every time I see you, of my humble beginnings, to cherish every celestial coin I possess and every flattering smile I receive, as well as every word of praise.”

Fu Ke’s expression fell, “Do you really think your death is such a big deal? I won’t do anything; once I step out, I won’t say a word, and just like that, I’ll return to the Rain Dragon Sect. Everything on Jade Island will be handled seamlessly, and I’ll genuinely thank you for helping Jade Island connect with me through this hidden relationship. That’s what a wise man should do. Yu Fujing, you still lack vision; it’s no wonder you’re courting death.”

Fu Ke stood up, wiped his hands, and glanced back at Yu Fujing’s lifeless form, “I told you, drink well and say less nonsense, but you didn’t listen.”

Fu Ke truly left Jade Island, heading toward the mountain gate, then summoned his talisman boat to return to the Rain Dragon Sect.

As Fu Ke lay on the talisman boat with his eyes closed, he pondered future matters—like first becoming a Nascent Soul, then advancing to the upper five realms, eventually becoming the sect leader of the Rain Dragon Sect, claiming one of the four private residences of the Hanging Mountain, the Water Crystal Palace, as his private property, returning home in finery to that little corner of Baoping Continent, collecting those celestial maidens he had once regarded as divine, getting a few to serve him tea and water, like the one from Zhengyang Mountain, Su Jia, oh no, she had already fallen from the heights of the phoenix to become a muddy chicken, so she could be disregarded. Despite her beauty, what use was that? The world had no shortage of beautiful women.

What it lacked was someone like Fu Ke, who was destined to reach the peak.

Fu Ke raised a hand, gently clenched his fist, smiling, “I wonder if the female sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall might have a chance to be hidden away in my golden house; I’ve heard that Luo Zhenyi and Situ Weiran are both young, beautiful, capable fighters—prime candidates to become female sword immortals! If the Sword Qi Great Wall were to collapse, might I seize this opportunity?”

As for what would happen if the Sword Qi Great Wall fell into chaos, there would be those high and mighty Confucian sages to clean up the mess; what need would there be for Fu Ke and the Rain Dragon Sect to lend a hand?

Not to mention the Central Divine Continent; even closer, there was the current Confucian sage, Chen Chunan, standing on the city wall.

Moreover, this was merely a contingency. The sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall were truly interesting; in the world of righteousness, every Qi refiner feared death, yet those at the Sword Qi Great Wall seemed to fear life, engaging in acts that sought death.

With this thought, Fu Ke opened his eyes and silently reflected, “It’s a pity the beasts in the Savage World are too useless.”

A bird flew past the talisman boat, and Fu Ke glanced at it, laughing heartily.

The poets say that the rower and the waterbird share a dream.

We, the celestial guests, should share our dreams with the flying birds amid the white clouds.

Luhua Island could only be a neighbor to the Rain Dragon Sect, known for its strong-handed actions, not a vassal. Without some skill, that would be impossible.

In the last thousand years, the Rain Dragon Sect had indeed suffered losses at the hands of that sword immortal, but as for the other passing cultivators, even Earth Immortals, and those of the upper five realms, they had all been dealt with by the Rain Dragon Sect without protest. In any case, the outcomes were generally not good. Moreover, the Rain Dragon Sect was too far from the mainland, isolated in the sea, and far from the emperor’s reach, making its rules more effective than those of the Confucian Academy.

Luhua Island not being swallowed by the Rain Dragon Sect wasn’t due to the strength of its own cultivators. Rather, Luhua Island had an ancient ruin known as the “Creation Cave,” said to be guarded by an unknown Daoist high immortal who monopolized fortune, forbidding others from touching it. However, regarding this old legend, even the highest-ranking cultivators of Luhua Island could no longer ascertain its truth, as it was far too ancient. Those brave enough to explore the place never returned, gradually extinguishing such thoughts. Celestial opportunities might be precious, but one couldn’t risk their life for them. Besides, Luhua Island harbored no ambitions, and the Rain Dragon Sect had not swallowed this place, which said enough.

Luhua Island was only a distant neighbor of the most southwestern vassal island of the Rain Dragon Sect.

The cultivators of Luhua Island were numerous, but their wealth was limited, which could be blamed on the unwillingness of the Tongye Continent to deal with other continents. They were very reluctant to establish any cross-regional ferries. Although the route from Tongye Continent to Hanging Mountain was fraught with dangers compared to those of Laolong City, the major sects of Tongye and Yuguizong were capable of developing routes, which wouldn’t be too difficult or lose money. However, the celestial forces in Tongye Continent were primarily gigantic beings, renowned for their ease of life in the vast world of righteousness. Unlike other continents, where celestial mansions and masters could be found in almost every nation and region, it was different.

As the head of the Jiang family put it, “I could sneeze or pass gas and still make money. Why would I bother running to Hanging Mountain for a few coins?”

“You can insult me, Jiang Shangzhen, for being lowly, but you absolutely cannot insult my ability to make money. Whoever dares behave heroically, I'll bury them with money.”

But if Tongye Continent truly established a few cross-regional ferries and selected a transfer dock, Luhua Island would be the first choice.

Luhua Island was too isolated from the world; everyone simply followed their paths in cultivation. As for making money, there were those pearl-collecting cultivators who went to sea.

Thus, the cultivators here were more interested in gathering tales of extraordinary people from outside to share, otherwise, who were they practicing for? Luhua Island could not compare to the Rain Dragon Sect, which had never produced any astonishingly talented cultivators.

Today, there was a dispute that was hardly surprising.

Two groups of cultivators with average aptitude, boys and girls, found themselves divided into two factions.

Originally, they were arguing about whether a talented sword cultivator from the Rain Dragon Sect could rival the top genius of the Sword Qi Great Wall. The so-called genius was one who became a Golden Core sword cultivator before the age of one hundred.

Some insisted it was incomparable, while others claimed they were certainly not far off.

Before they knew it, the argument had shifted to just what kind of place the Sword Qi Great Wall was.

Some claimed that every hero and bold figure could be found there, insisting it was the densest gathering of sword immortals in the world. It was said that merely going out to buy a jug of wine would allow one to encounter many such figures. A place like that—if one never went to experience it, nor enjoyed a drink there, it would be a shame for their identity as a cultivator.

The essence of argument since ancient times is to declare everything the other side says wrong, even if it is right, and so soon someone said that sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall were all foolish, never doing business. Almost every cross-regional ferry was able to make a fortune, and it was exactly because of the Rain Dragon Sect that it had become so wealthy, indirectly profiting from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

A young man laughed coldly, declaring that when he grew up, he too would go to Hanging Mountain to earn the Sword Qi Great Wall’s celestial money, taking all those so-called sword immortals’ money without leaving a single snowflake coin behind.

A passing old cultivator cursed them for being nothing but bickering children and told them to go practice instead.

The younger generation not only ignored his advice, but they insisted on having the esteemed elder judge their argument.

The old man was known for his countless stories on Luhua Island, and he had no air about him, able to chat with anyone. When in a good mood, he would even treat them to wine, regardless of whether they were mere kids.

The elder was a Golden Core Earth Immortal, with a seat in the ancestral hall and a lavish private residence on the island. He had traveled far and wide, visiting places like the Southern Posa Continent, Baoping Continent’s Laolong City, and the Northern Julu Continent’s Bone Marsh, seeing much and experiencing a variety of events.

Thus, the younger generations loved to listen to the old immortal’s jokes.

When he was tipsy, he could recount all sorts of fascinating tales from around the vast world of righteousness. Whether it was about customs on the Day of Beginning of Spring or how the courtesans in brothels would invite boys in open-crotch pants to dance to ward off evil, or how the Confucian Academy did not endorse the burning of paper money, while both Buddhism and Daoism also did not recognize this custom as their own, leading to years of uproar, leaving the children of Luhua Island dreaming of adventures.

The elder loved to tell stories about Jiang Shangzhen, often saying he shared a table with the renowned figure from Tongye Continent.

No one believed him, of course.

Today, the old man was dragged by the younger generation and wouldn’t be allowed to leave until he mixed in some praise for the talented sword cultivator of the Rain Dragon Sect and some good words about the Sword Qi Great Wall, finally granting him a moment of peace.

The elder walked down the mountain along a wide path, ancient trees towering on both sides, lush greenery surrounding him. The elder, with nothing to do, fell back into his old habit, quietly counting the steps until he reached the edge of Luhua Island, where the waves rolled endlessly. Feeling quite well, the elder had made quite a bit of money at Miliu Cliff in recent years, earning a good sum of small summer coins. What’s more, he felt that the money was earned with a clear conscience. Occasionally, in the dead of night, he would even consider sending some celestial coins to the Sword Qi Great Wall, but just thinking about such a joke made him laugh heartily. What was he, Song Sui, to send money to the Sword Qi Great Wall? Did he know any sword immortals?

The old man scratched his head, feeling a bit melancholy. If he could truly say he had shared a drink with Jiang Shangzhen, how good that would be.

In the future, when boasting to the kids, he could thump his chest with pride.

The old man looked back up the mountain, hoping for a life of peace, with only minor troubles and no great worries.

The old man regained his senses, chuckling to himself, shaking his head before climbing back up the mountain, counting the steps once more, his pace leisurely and unhurried.

He nostalgically recalled the days when a rosy-cheeked girl would walk beside him. He wasn’t handsome, and she wasn’t particularly beautiful either, but they liked each other. As cultivators, a few steps were nothing, and they would naturally not tire. Yet she always insisted on taking breaks, and he would sit with her on the steps, gazing into the distance, watching the moon rise over the sea.

The old man halted his steps and turned to gaze at the moon on the sea.

The people of today have seen the moons of the past; the current moon has cast its light on old friends—everyone has seen it.

Suddenly, the old man pressed his hand to his forehead, stabilizing his mind, opening his eyes wide, concentrating on the moonlight on the steps, feeling something strange for just a moment. But as he looked around, the world was silent, with only the occasional whisper of pine flowers falling to the ground.

The old man’s mind was sharp. Although he had never truly shared a drink with Jiang Shangzhen, having traveled across continents and witnessed extraordinary beings, he did not think this was trivial. Immediately, he summoned the wind and flew to the top of an ancient pine, still finding no trace. The protective mountain formation showed no signs of disturbance. Finally, he gazed toward a solitary peak marked as a forbidden zone on Luhua Island—the once-famous Creation Cave, which had gradually faded into obscurity.

The old man self-deprecatingly said, “If the old immortal inside truly emerges, that would be a good thing.”

The vast sea stretched beyond, even broader than the nine continents. Throughout history, many immortals quietly departed the land to choose a location of good fortune in the sea, hiding away to cultivate, either breaking through in silence or quietly dissipating, all without anyone knowing.

**(End of Chapter)**

 ### Chapter 743: Gentle Winds and Soft Moons (Part Two)

The Jade Seal Sect (Yugui Zong) is located at the southern tip of the Tung Leaf Continent (Tongye Zhou). The peaks rise in layers, deep and serene, infused with abundant spiritual energy, making it an exceptional place for cultivation. Among its many mountains, the Divine Seal Peak (Shenzhuan Feng) is renowned for its towering beauty that seems to touch the heavens. 

With the rise of many talented individuals in the Jade Seal Sect, there has never been a worry about a lack of successors. The only concern has been how the ancestral hall can avoid favoritism among generations of geniuses. From the founding ancestor, Xun Yuan, to the relatively younger Jiang Shangzhen, and finally to the most outstanding talent of the current generation, Wei Ying, the sect has always been rich in exceptional individuals. 

There are also other talented cultivators of similar standing to Jiang Shangzhen and Wei Ying. If not for the overshadowing brilliance of these two, their own fame would have flourished significantly in other sects. 

On a mountain called Nine Strategies Peak (Jiu Yi Feng), the pavilions stretch continuously, surrounded by ethereal mist and celestial birds soaring above, it is an enchanting place that rivals even small heavenly realms. This peak, which draws spiritual energy from all the mountains and streams outside the Jade Seal Sect’s ancestral mountain, is particularly special. Throughout its history, every sect leader has cultivated here, including Xun Yuan, who only moved out after becoming sect leader.

It is said that when Jiang Shangzhen was at the brink of attaining the Golden Core realm, he found Nine Strategies Peak within reach, only to realize that he could not settle there, as if a cooked duck had suddenly flown away, leaving him with nothing but the frustration of being unable to claim it. Frustrated, he left Tung Leaf Continent grandly, heading directly to North Julu Continent (Beijulu Zhou) to stir up trouble, tarnishing the reputation of the Jade Seal Sect throughout that region.

After Xun Yuan moved out of Nine Strategies Peak and before Wei Ying ascended, the peak remained unclaimed due to Jiang Shangzhen's inability to become its master. Everyone understood that whoever could achieve the Golden Core here would undoubtedly be the next sect leader.

Wei Ying was brought to the Jade Seal Sect while still in swaddling clothes. By the time he was nineteen, he moved to Nine Strategies Peak amidst much expectation and support. From then on, he often found himself standing atop Nine Strategies Peak, gazing up at Divine Seal Peak, never hiding the admiration in his eyes. 

After all, this would be his next place of cultivation. As long as he refrained from unnecessary actions and focused on his training, it would eventually belong to him. There was no need for secrecy.

Today, Wei Ying stood on the corridor of a rooftop, looking up at a specific spot on Divine Seal Peak, which felt different from earlier. Beside him stood a tall young man, unlike his father. This young man had an ordinary appearance, with light brows and a somewhat effeminate name, yet he possessed narrow, elongated eyes, giving him a semblance of his father.

Jiang Heng.

However, in the ancestral records of the Jade Seal Sect and the Jiang family genealogy, he was officially listed as Jiang Beihai. Yet, those familiar with him still preferred to call him Jiang Heng. 

Whether one could refer to Jiang Beihai as Jiang Heng was a subtle sign of success among the younger generation of the Jade Seal Sect. After all, both names belonged to the only son of Jiang Shangzhen. If Wei Ying was the indisputable next sect leader of the Jade Seal Sect, then Jiang Heng, while not as prominent, should still inherit the next fortune of the cloud cave.

However, in recent years, there had been whispers that Jiang Shangzhen, under the alias Zhou Fei, had fathered another son. This news had troubled Jiang Heng for quite some time, but he could only endure it in silence, even suppressing any thoughts of sending someone to infiltrate the cloud cave and eliminate that brother. 

The reason was simple: Jiang Heng feared his father, Jiang Shangzhen, more than anyone else.

The terrifying nature of Jiang Shangzhen was well-known among the people of Tung Leaf Continent. But Jiang Heng's fear of his father ran deeper. Jiang Heng's mother, a direct descendant of a highly esteemed ancestor of the Jade Seal Sect, had always known that Jiang Shangzhen had never truly loved her. 

Yet, when alone with young Jiang Heng, she would still show sincere happiness, sharing her heartfelt thoughts with him, telling her child how grateful she was just to be by his father's side. 

As she lay on the brink of death, Jiang Shangzhen sat beside her sickbed, his expression gentle as he held the frail woman's hand without saying a word. Instead, it was Jiang Heng's mother who tightly grasped Jiang Shangzhen's hand, smiling as she spoke words that left young Jiang Heng feeling as if he had fallen into an icy abyss, “That woman, I secretly met her once. She’s already gray-haired, and even when young, she wasn't particularly beautiful. Jiang Heng, with your name, I guessed your thoughts and fulfilled your wish. Yet, you didn’t even say thank you. I’ve spent all these years only feeling angry about this.” 

Jiang Shangzhen gently patted her hand, smiling softly as he said, “Did you know, while you were secretly watching her, I was secretly watching you? You looked so innocent and lovable, like you had won at everything back then. You were incredibly beautiful.” 

She nodded and smiled before leaving this world.

Jiang Heng, sitting on a chair by the bedside, wept quietly.

Then Jiang Shangzhen turned his head and laughed, “Crying your mother to death, and now you want to cry your father to death? That’s not what a filial son does.” 

The child was so frightened that he immediately sat up straight and remained still.

Jiang Shangzhen then said something that Jiang Heng could only remember but never understood, “If you can’t be yourself, you first have to learn to deceive yourself. Being Jiang Shangzhen's son isn’t easy.” 

Despite the deep-rooted fear of his father, Jiang Heng lived quite well in the Jade Seal Sect. In fact, apart from Wei Ying, there were only one or two others who could match the young master Jiang Heng.

At this moment, Jiang Heng followed Wei Ying's gaze towards Divine Seal Peak and asked with a smile, “Are you still so fixated on that Sui girl?”

Wei Ying shook his head, “It’s not about being fixated; I just can’t forget her. What angers me most is that she would rather die than come visit Nine Strategies Peak.” 

Leaning against the railing, Wei Ying stopped looking at Divine Seal Peak and turned to Jiang Heng, smiling softly, “Women’s thoughts, Jiang Uncle knows best.” 

Jiang Heng leaned on the railing, unwilling to discuss this topic. His name had become a source of amusement for many elders in the Jade Seal Sect. 

Adding to his woes was the matter of the cloud cave, where those with seats in the ancestral hall would never outsmart his father. So they took pleasure in venting their frustrations on Jiang Heng. 

After all, those elders understood clearly that Jiang Shangzhen had never given Jiang Heng any hope, let alone expectations.

Jiang Heng changed the subject, “Looking at the aura from Divine Seal Peak, the old sect leader is surely on the verge of breaking into the Ascension realm.” 

Wei Ying nodded with a smile, “So my desire to become the next sect leader feels even more distant. Thankfully, only one sect leader can exist in the Jade Seal Sect, but Tung Leaf Continent can have two to three Ascended beings. I wonder which fortunate soul will become the third. I think that Huang Ting from Taiping Mountain and that child who left the Fuji Sect for the academy have a relatively higher chance.” 

Jiang Heng genuinely admired Wei Ying for his ability to talk about anything, even daring to speak freely. This was not something that developed only after moving into Nine Strategies Peak; he had been like this since the beginning of his cultivation. 

Jiang Shangzhen never hid his fondness for Wei Ying, claiming his own son wasn't much of a son at all, but thankfully there was a Wei Ying who resembled him living on Nine Strategies Peak.

Currently, the Jade Seal Sect was flourishing and not limited to just one continent. 

Not only was the old sect leader Xun Yuan about to ascend to the Ascension realm, but the lower sect, the True Realm Sect, had already firmly established itself in the Baping Continent (Baoping Zhou). 

Also, the Tung Leaf Sect, Taiping Mountain, and Fuji Sect had all suffered significant losses, and within the sect, the talk had begun that as long as the Jade Seal Sect desired to move northward, even if the three sects formed an alliance, they could not stop us. The entire continent, both above and below the mountains, would belong to us, surpassing even the Great Li Dynasty of the Baping Continent, which claims the entirety of its territory.

The Jade Seal Sect had gone from being the second in Tung Leaf Continent thousands of years ago to becoming the ruling force without any effort, and it seemed that for the next several thousand years, the sect could continue to do nothing and still hold on to its position of power.

It was likely that the old sect leader Xun Yuan could smile in his dreams. 

Indeed, the Tung Leaf Sect had suffered an unimaginable amount of misfortune, and it was not surprising that others would revel in their downfall. 

First, the Ascended Ancestor Du Mao died mysteriously, and not only that, but it also implicated a small heavenly realm. Du Mao couldn’t even leave behind all the fragments of his Glazed Golden Body after his death, and with the sword cultivator’s meticulous strikes, the impact was profound, shattering the hearts of almost all the Tung Leaf Sect’s cultivators.

Then came Jiang Shangzhen’s grand banquet on the sea of clouds, right on the edge of the Tung Leaf Sect’s territory. If Du Mao, the founding ancestor, had been alive, he wouldn’t have needed to personally intervene. Jiang Shangzhen would have been forced to retreat in embarrassment.

Afterward, there was a defection from an elder of the fifth realm, who took the sect’s treasures and defected to the Jade Seal Sect. He accompanied Jiang Shangzhen to the Baping Continent to select a location for a lower sect and expand their territory. However, there had been no news of this person in recent years; it was said he had gone into seclusion.

Suddenly, Wei Ying said, “Earlier, we talked about Huang Ting. In my opinion, her fortune is quite unfortunate, being trapped in one continent. If the sword cultivators of Tung Leaf Continent shed their narrow-mindedness and were willing to travel along the Sword Qi Great Wall, even if Tung Leaf Continent cannot become North Julu Continent, they should have already attracted one or two Ascended sword cultivators early on. If I had the final say, starting today, I would send sword cultivators to the Upside-Down Mountain. The deeper the mountain, the heavier the mist; each descent would at least yield some dew, and with the efforts of the ants, the sword path’s fortune in Tung Leaf Continent would accumulate year after year, naturally becoming abundant. Of course, these wandering sword cultivators must remain unaware, because only with sincere hearts can things come to fruition.” 

Wei Ying sighed, “If she stays in the Jade Seal Sect, I would gladly help her compete with Huang Ting in the sword path.” 

Jiang Heng did not know whether the concept of fortune was something Wei Ying had come up with himself or if it was revealed by the old sect leader. However, Jiang Heng would not ask. Knowing the matter, what was the point of asking further?

As for how that mysterious woman came to the Jade Seal Sect and why Wei Ying held her in such high regard, Jiang Heng did not care. 

Finally, Wei Ying slowly said, “After the worst comes the best; when the moon is full, it begins to wane. Don’t overlook that.” 

Jiang Heng looked into the distance, lazily smiling, “I’m just someone who eats and waits to die. All the grand endeavors are left to you, Brother Ying.” 

“An old horse at the edge of the field, unties the reins and wishes to sleep; it has no strength left to withstand the whip.” 

Wei Ying chuckled, straining his eyes to look far ahead, “What a gloomy sight, with thousands of graves.” 

Hearing such strange words, Jiang Heng merely registered them subconsciously. 

His thoughts drifted far away, recalling years past when he traveled to Upside-Down Mountain, the Osmanthus Isle, Lady Gui, and the clouds above the Old Dragon City. 

During that trip, Jiang Heng had originally intended to secure the first intercontinental ferry in Tung Leaf Continent as a new source of income for the Jiang family. Though the profits were modest, it would have drawn the attention of that elusive man shrouded in mystery. 

However, nothing went as planned. Not only did that secret endeavor fail, but upon returning from Upside-Down Mountain to the Jade Seal Sect, he was met with the shocking rumor that after his return from a trip, he inexplicably gained a brother?

Today, Jiang Heng returned on the wind from Nine Strategies Peak to his residence, still the old house where his mother had lived. 

Jiang Heng sat on the threshold of a room, turning to look into the empty interior, choking back tears as he murmured, “Mother, Father lied to you. At that time, Father was still in the cloud cave. How could he possibly have seen you? Do you really know...?” 

Finally, Jiang Heng raised his head and whispered, “Mother, you are so intelligent and refined, how could you not know? You’ve always been like that, caring most for that cold-hearted scoundrel. Mother, wait for me. One day, I will make him apologize to you in person. I promise, from that day on, I won’t be Jiang Heng anymore; I will be Jiang Beihai...” 

Suddenly, a familiar voice, which struck fear deep within Jiang Heng, rang out not far away, “Good son, saying such things about your father is quite unfilial; you might just die from it.” 

Jiang Heng tensed up, stiffly turning to see the man with a smiling face. 

That man sighed, “I finally returned home, and I’m met with complaints from my eldest son. If I were truly cold-hearted and heartless, wouldn’t I have been blasted to pieces by your words?” 

Jiang Heng swayed on his feet, pale as a ghost. 

The man looked at Jiang Heng, then nodded with a smile, “You may be a bit foolish; after all, you take after your mother. But at least you’re still a person. Following her is actually a good thing. Foolish people have their own blessings, which is nice. However, family rules still need to be upheld. Today, I won’t hold it against you. Growing up, I, as your father, never taught you anything, nor can I scold you for anything. But from now on, remember this: A father may be unkind, but a son must be filial. Strive for brotherly friendship and let no one cause me worry.” 

With his mind in a muddle, Jiang Heng could only nod stiffly. 

Jiang Shangzhen turned and left, clicking his tongue, “How did I end up with such an ugly son? It’s truly distressing to look at you. You’re doing a disservice to your parents. Next time you see me, lower your head when you speak.” 

Only then did Jiang Heng dare to wipe the sweat and tears from his face, feeling as if he had walked through the gates of hell.

The words of that man today, if overheard by outsiders, would likely evoke pity for Jiang Heng’s plight, but in reality, they were far kinder than what he had said in the past.

After Jiang Shangzhen left the residence, he went directly to Divine Seal Peak’s ancestral hall to welcome the old sect leader out of seclusion, who had successfully reached the Ascension realm.

Regardless of his realm or status, Wei Ying should have a place in this ancestral hall, and it would surely not be a lowly one. However, Nine Strategies Peak was too unique, and thus it lacked seating.

The rigid rules passed down by the ancestors left no room for discussion. After all, in the realm of immortals, ancestral laws have always trumped everything.

Upon entering, Jiang Shangzhen, slightly affected by Jiang Heng’s earlier antics, felt his mood improve as he enjoyed the expressions of the old masters who looked as though they had eaten something unpleasant.

He noticed a female cultivator sitting near the entrance, well-preserved and equally beautiful. Jiang Shangzhen immediately moved closer, smiling brightly, “Sister Liu, it’s quite windy here; be careful not to catch a chill. It’s been a few days since we last met, and you look so thin; it pains my heart. Can’t afford to buy meat? Can’t you find me for money? Don’t sit here; come, come, come, sit on my lap.” 

The woman glared at him coldly.

Jiang Shangzhen sighed dramatically, his face full of sorrow, and walked away.

Everyone seated in the ancestral hall knew that she was one of those who wished to skin Jiang Shangzhen alive.

Of course, most of the chair owners felt similarly towards him.

Yet, Jiang Shangzhen continued to live well, wandering around as if he were carrying a dung pit. He was happy, but everyone else found it repulsive.

After Jiang Shangzhen settled down, he leaned back in his chair, exhaling deeply, “It really is more comfortable at home; even squatting feels more at ease.” 

An elder sitting opposite him, responsible for the rules, said coldly, “Jiang Shangzhen, keep your mouth clean!” 

Jiang Shangzhen paused, “Who are you? Are you my father? Who are you to teach me? If I acknowledge you as my father today, will you give me that celestial weapon? I’ll kneel right here and call you father. If we acknowledge each other as father and son, your precious daughter and lovely granddaughter, how would they still like me? It’s a win-win. If I were you, I wouldn’t hesitate to recognize me as your son; you could even consider recognizing me as your father!” 

The elder closed his eyes to meditate. 

It was impossible to openly confront Jiang Shangzhen with violence; shouting wouldn’t work either. 

In fact, they had already faced off once at Jiang’s cloud cave. 

The outcome had not been good for either side.

That time, sect leader Xun Yuan had been extraordinarily furious.

Near the center, a wave rippled, and an old man stepped out; it was Xun Yuan, who had just broken through, smiling, “Alright, in all the ancestral halls of sects in the world, none can match the chaotic atmosphere of our Jade Seal Sect.” 

Jiang Shangzhen widened his eyes, “Old Xun, by the looks of it, you’ve broken through two realms?” 

Since there were no outsiders, Xun Yuan immediately cursed, “Stay away from me.” 

Jiang Shangzhen lifted his backside, the legs of his chair wobbling as he shuffled back. 

Xun Yuan straightened his expression, “Let’s get to business. First, the preparations for the sect ceremony are halted. Second, let’s discuss the candidates for the new sect leader of the Jade Seal Sect. In the vast world, this is not considered a rule nor an exception. So don’t look like you’ve seen a ghost. If you’re warm-hearted, be warm-hearted; if you’re envious, be envious. Just learn from that Wei Ying; there’s nothing to be embarrassed about.” 

Jiang Shangzhen moved his chair back to its original position and said seriously, “I can immediately resign from the position of the True Realm Sect leader and take on a heavier burden. As for Wei Ying, he can take my former position; young people still need more experience.” 

All the elders and high-ranking officials in the ancestral hall thought that either Jiang Shangzhen was Xun Yuan’s illegitimate son or that Xun Yuan had indeed broken through and lost his mind.

Because Xun Yuan nodded, “That’s acceptable.” 

Fortunately, Xun Yuan’s next words were somewhat reassuring. 

The old man turned and fixed his gaze on the now-standing Jiang Shangzhen, speaking solemnly, “Once you take my seat, you won’t just be Jiang Shangzhen, the head of the Jiang family.” 

Jiang Shangzhen promptly sat back down. 

Xun Yuan’s expression darkened, “Stand up! If, back then, you had wanted to go to Nine Strategies Peak and I hadn’t agreed, you’d have to roll to another peak. Today, I want you to be this sect leader; you must accept it and become the leader of the Jade Seal Sect!” 

Jiang Shangzhen slowly stood and bowed, “Jiang Shangzhen finally says these four words: ‘I will obey the law’.” 

Xun Yuan smiled, “Let me sit in this chair for a little while longer.” 

After the old man sat down, he gazed at the clouds and mountains outside the door, suddenly reminded of an ancient poem.

The clouds have no heart as they rise from the ravine; the birds weary from flight know to return. Return, return. The trees are lush, and the spring flows gently, return, return. 

But what truly made the old man remember this poem was not the beautiful words that even the immortals atop the mountains would envy but just the first three words.

“My family is poor.”

If there were a bored immortal who decided to set out from Luohua Island across the sea, they would land near the Fuji Sect. 

The ancestral mountain of the Fuji Sect is called Chui Chang, which is shrouded in clouds all year round. 

In the past, it was as renowned as Taiping Mountain, located in the central part of Tung Leaf Continent, roughly positioned in the west and east, opposite the Tung Leaf Sect and the Jade Seal Sect.

The Fuji Sect excels in “Immortal Questions and Answers, Bestowing Truth to All”, yet even though it’s a Taoist sect, it does not belong to the three veins of the Baiyu Capital in the Qingming World, similar to the Longhu Mountain in the Central Plains or the Daxuandu Temple in the Qingming World.

Before the catastrophic events that almost devastated the entire Tung Leaf Continent, not discussing their true foundations, merely in terms of influence, the Fuji Sect still had the upper hand over Taiping Mountain. The two sects had harbored longstanding grievances. After two great calamities, one severely injuring the Fuji Sect and the other wounding Taiping Mountain, the two sects, having gone through hardships together, naturally set aside their past grievances and became allies, with both sect cultivators heading down the mountain to fight side by side for many years, their relationship greatly improved.

Tonight, a pair of young men and women ascended the long-sealed Fuji Sect. 

Before the sealing, the Fuji Sect had moved the bustling Huan Tian Street down the mountain. This vibrant street had evidently become a place of sorrow for the sect leader, Ji Hai, because every glance would remind him of the companion who had built this street with his own hands. 

On Huan Tian Street, a young man dressed in scholar’s robes bought a few trinkets, avoiding any priced over ten snowflake coins. 

Beside him was an incredibly beautiful swordswoman, but no one dared to cause trouble, and for a simple reason: that sword had the style of Taiping Mountain’s sword. 

And there was only one such stunning Taiping Mountain female immortal: the Yuan Ying sword immortal, Huang Ting, renowned across the continent for her exceptional fortune. 

It’s known that even the likes of He Xiaoliang from the God Gua Sect in the Baping Continent and the current head of the Qingliang Sect in North Julu, had only been referred to as “the second Huang Ting” in terms of fortune.

Beside Huang Ting, the disheveled scholar was none other than Zhong Kui, who had lost his identity as a Confucian gentleman. 

As a steward, Chen Ping’an had learned from Zhong Kui early on. 

Zhong Kui sidled up, smiling, “I’m not quite human or ghost, and though I’ve lost my identity as a Confucian disciple, I still don’t have the standing to learn Ji Hai’s unique techniques. Relying solely on my teacher’s connections might not be enough, but since I’m a close friend of Chen Ping’an, and your relationship with him is good, we’re practically family. You can't not help me out a little.” 

Huang Ting had just returned from her travels in North Julu not long ago. Unable to break through her Yuan Ying bottleneck in one go, she returned to Taiping Mountain and claimed to be in seclusion, but in truth, she was just too lazy to see anyone. 

On her way south, when passing through the Baping Continent, she even made a special trip to the Great Li Dynasty to see that ugly little girl, wondering how her swordsmanship and knife techniques were coming along. To her surprise, the little girl was not on the mountain, but two dubious characters had eagerly tried to keep her there. The older one seemed to want to deceive her into becoming a guardian, while the other was practically drooling, resembling a street rogue. 

Huang Ting had no mood to joke with Zhong Kui. This time coming down the mountain was due to the sect leader pushing her to go, so she had to accompany Zhong Kui to Chui Chang Mountain, thus she spoke seriously, “I have a secret letter from the sect leader that should help. As for the rest, I won’t bother. If Ji Hai doesn’t agree, I can’t help you; you’re on your own.” 

Zhong Kui was filled with worries. 

Huang Ting couldn’t understand why he hadn’t been serious about things earlier, and why he was only taking them seriously upon arriving at Chui Chang Mountain.

Earlier, back in Huan Tian Street at the foot of the mountain, this former Confucian gentleman, Zhong Kui, was haggling fiercely over prices, showing no hint of shame. Huang Ting, who had been through the streets below more often, felt embarrassed in comparison. 

But Zhong Kui had one admirable quality: he could take a joke; even if he rubbed salt in his own wounds, he wouldn’t mind. 

As he tugged at his collar and shook his sleeves, Zhong Kui said, “When a scholar’s interests are compromised, yet he can still maintain a sense of calmness, that’s a small accomplishment in self-cultivation. If you can’t do that, it’s just a matter of pretense. Right now, I’m embodying the true essence of grandeur. Back in the day, that Chen Ping’an kid was absolutely awestruck by my magnificent aura, idolizing me to the point where he wanted to be my disciple. I didn’t agree because I thought he lacked the depth to write poetry.” 

Huang Ting remarked, “I’m not blind; I can see that.” 

Zhong Kui looked westward towards Chui Chang Mountain, which faced the sea. 

He muttered to himself, “I really want to see the Sword Qi Great Wall. But my teacher won’t let me.” 

Huang Ting glanced at Zhong Kui. 

Zhong Kui forced a wry smile, “I’m not you; I’m a sword cultivator, and everything is guided by the heart. But scholars have many rules.” 

Huang Ting laughed, “You’ve lost your title of gentleman and your identity as a Confucian disciple, yet you still cling to your identity as a scholar. Hmm, you really are holding on tightly.” 

Zhong Kui had one wonderful trait: he could take a joke, even when salt was rubbed in his wounds.

Huang Ting glanced at Zhong Kui. 

Zhong Kui forced a wry smile, “I’m not you; I’m a sword cultivator, and everything is guided by the heart. But scholars have many rules.” 

Huang Ting laughed, “You’ve lost your title of gentleman and your identity as a Confucian disciple, yet you still cling to your identity as a scholar. Hmm, you really are holding on tightly.” 

Zhong Kui had one wonderful trait: he could take a joke, even when salt was rubbed in his wounds. 

Zhong Kui tugged at his collar, shook his sleeves, and said, “When a scholar’s interests are compromised, yet he can still maintain a sense of calmness, that’s a small accomplishment in self-cultivation. If you can’t do that, it’s just a matter of pretense. Right now, I’m embodying the true essence of grandeur. Back in the day, that Chen Ping’an kid was absolutely awestruck by my magnificent aura, idolizing me to the point where he wanted to be my disciple. I didn’t agree because I thought he lacked the depth to write poetry.” 

Huang Ting remarked, “I’m not blind; I can see that.”

 ### Chapter 744: Gentle Winds and Soft Moonlight (Part Three)

Ever since Du Mao's rise, the Tongye Sect had never found itself in such a precarious situation. If it weren't for the sect master sacrificing his path to ascendancy and breaking through his bottleneck using unorthodox methods to become a sword cultivator at the Immortal Realm, along with the protective mountain array "Wutong Heavenly Umbrella" still in place, the past few years for Tongye Sect would have been even more unbearable.

The Ancestor of Law, unexpectedly carrying a precious treasure, defected, causing instability within their ranks. The offerings scattered, and despite the vast territory of Tongye Sect still existing, they simply lacked personnel.

It wasn't that Tongye Sect had no potential cultivators; on the contrary, there were many promising seedlings with excellent qualifications. However, most had yet to truly mature.

In the thousands of years prior, Tongye Sect had acted with arrogance, expecting that all their actions were justified. Other immortal forces, from top to bottom, had grown accustomed to it, even going so far as to actively assist Tongye Sect in accumulating resources in exchange for a bit of goodwill—perhaps a local Earth Immortal from Tongye Sect visiting, making an appearance at a mountain ceremony to lend support, or young disciples of Tongye Sect going down the mountain for trials, bringing along their own sect members for some roughhousing. As long as they didn't accidentally break the Bridge of Longevity, it would suffice. In the unfortunate event of a mishap, Tongye Sect would be willing to offer some form of compensation later, thus preserving a semblance of face for those sects. 

During the peak ceremonies, as long as a place was secured, they wouldn't expect to be on the ancestral mountain, just a distant view of the prominent figures of Tongye Sect from another peak would serve as a practical banner of their influence.

Yet, what had once been a familiar state of affairs for both the sect and outsiders had now become one of the most criticized aspects of Tongye Sect. Not only was it criticized, but many underhanded actions had escalated. Some sects further from Tongye but with sufficient depth of cultivation were on the verge of openly undermining Tongye Sect, quickly devouring many of its lower-ranking offerings.

Thus, even though the sect master had ascended to the Immortal Realm, he still felt utterly exhausted. 

The once-subservient mountain deities, previously groveling at their feet, had begun to secretly forge alliances, daring to negotiate with Tongye Sect.

Many of the lower kingdoms that would have once presented their potential disciples to Tongye Sect were now harboring different intentions, opting to divert their paths, bringing their children first to the Fuyi Sect or Taiping Mountain, to see if the immortal masters there would take a liking to them.

In all fairness, Tongye Sect had not been devoid of merit; they had indeed performed many actions that could not be criticized. They had extended kindness time and again, showering blessings like rain that nurtured the land for thousands of miles, and such praise was not merely flattery.

Unfortunately, the current cultivators of Tongye Sect were reluctant to mention these past deeds.

A man in a purple robe stood by a river within the sect's territory, a place that had previously hosted the fleeting presence of sword immortals. 

Initially, he would have been furious at another's sword strike, but as time passed and various unforeseen changes arose—seemingly without warning—he had come to realize that the roots of disaster had already begun to spread.

Tongye Continent had relied too heavily on the cultivation level of the revitalizing ancestor. 

The ancestor had been overly fond of using his prowess to suppress others, leading to a culture of imitation within the sect that permeated both upper and lower ranks.

A stable society, in essence, was not a bad thing; it fostered a competitive spirit, a flourishing of great sects.

Issues arising from outside the mountains could often be resolved by cutting down the problem swiftly. If that failed, the name "Tongye Sect" could be invoked for resolution. If all else failed, they could return to the sect and request the intervention of senior elders—three strikes, and it would rarely go wrong. Those who were uncooperative would lose their heads, while those who were more agreeable would apologize and bow at the mountain gate.

It wasn't that Tongye Continent had been without its unique aspects for thousands of years; rather, these embellishments seemed unable to withstand significant upheaval.

Once the revitalizing ancestor departed, coupled with Du Mao's ruthless actions to obliterate a minor cave heaven for survival, it was not just the ungrateful offerings who felt the strain; even the sect master found himself disheartened.

Even if he switched roles, he believed he would make the same choice as Du Mao.

At that moment, a timid young woman approached him.

The man turned and smiled, asking, “How has his sword heart recovered?”

This acknowledged sword genius of Tongye Sect had received a long sword personally bestowed by Ancestor Du Mao, yet ended up almost shattering his sword heart due to a few casual words.

The young woman, who had only just shed her youthful naivety, replied happily, “Reporting to the sect master, senior brother’s sword heart is nearly restored. Once it is fully recovered, he is hopeful of breaking through immediately.”

Though the man was exhausted and had lost all possibilities for his own path, seeing the young faces of those who would become the pillars of Tongye Sect’s next revival reignited a flicker of hope within him.

He smiled gently, “You all have worked hard these past few years. Many responsibilities that should belong to your seniors have fallen onto your shoulders.”

This girl, once deemed too timid by the Ancestor Hall, had surprisingly become more resilient in this harsh reality, a quality uncommon in the young of Tongye Sect in the past—a result of the sect's previous smooth sailing.

She shook her head vigorously, gathering her courage to declare, “Reporting to the sect master, practicing both cultivation and inner strength is wonderful! It’s not difficult at all, so please don’t worry!”

The purple-robed sword immortal smiled lightly; it was indeed good that she could speak her mind so openly.

As he prepared to leave on his sword, he turned to her and said, “Our Tongye Sect has hope. I believe in you, and you must also believe in yourselves.”

Once the sect master’s figure had faded from view, the young woman sat by the river, lost in thought.

She wondered how that most unreasonable sword immortal would negotiate with the wild world once he reached the Sword Qi Great Wall.

She tossed a small stone into the river, secretly cursing that man.

**Baoping Continent, Old Dragon City.**

In the prince’s residence, Song Jixin, also known as Prince Song Mu of the Great Li Dynasty, felt overwhelmed today and sought solace in a quiet corner, lying on a long bench in a corridor.

All sorts of characters from different walks of life were clamoring to enter the prince’s residence. 

Song Jixin felt increasingly that he lacked trustworthy and capable people around him.

As long as someone had a good head on their shoulders and sufficient cultivation, he didn’t mind their background—provided they were chosen by him.

Otherwise, hints from the Fu family, implications from the Jiang family in Yunlin, and the actions of various figures from Zhengyang Mountain and Qingfeng City made Song Jixin feel irritated.

The key was that many qualified individuals who could enter the residence still warranted his attention.

Previously, he hadn’t thought it difficult to speak straightforwardly with people or to converse with ghosts. Now, he didn’t find it too hard, but he felt exhausted.

Ultimately, despite having been a prince for several years, Song Jixin still didn’t feel like a true prince ruling over half a continent.

Even though Nascent Soul cultivators and those at the Fifth Stage treated him with respect, and powerful military officers of the Great Li Dynasty or noble offspring from the south visiting Old Dragon City weighed their words and tones when speaking to him, Song Jixin still felt out of place.

It was like a dream.

The thing that troubled him the most, however, was a seemingly trivial matter.

His long-time maid, Zhi Gui, had begun to feel increasingly distant.

Song Jixin felt he could no longer understand her.

In fact, Zhi Gui hadn’t said anything unreasonable, not even a glance out of place.

Yet, Song Jixin could sense the strange atmosphere between the prince’s residence and the Fu family in Old Dragon City.

He didn’t want to ask her; he wanted her to tell him herself.

Neither of them took the initiative—he didn’t ask, she didn’t say.

Lying on the long bench, Song Jixin resolved to think of nothing and take a short nap, murmuring, “Could this be what they call a superficial harmony with a deep division? No way.”

Suddenly, he sat up straight.

Because a man in a white robe had taken a seat beside him.

His royal uncle, Song Changjing.

And the Ten-Stage Martial Artist, Song Changjing!

Song Changjing, with an indifferent expression, said, “Are you already feeling overwhelmed?”

Song Jixin nodded, “Every matter is time-consuming, and while I can’t guarantee they’re done perfectly, there certainly won’t be any major mistakes. You can rest assured, Uncle. If I deserve rebuke, I will listen intently and correct my mistakes.”

Song Changjing sneered, “If scolding you were effective, I could just berate you to death.”

Song Jixin felt a suffocating pressure, struggling to breathe.

Yet, in reality, Song Changjing had not made any aggressive moves; he merely spoke harshly.

Song Changjing continued, “Ma Ku Xuan from Zhenwu Mountain will be coming here to work in the future.”

Song Jixin’s face darkened.

That troublemaker from Xinghua Alley!

It was rare for him to harbor such animosity toward someone.

Song Changjing stood to leave, glancing at Song Jixin, “I can promise you one thing—if you ever wish to kill Ma Ku Xuan, just let me know. But it’s only one chance. Many requests, I may not agree to, such as killing His Majesty the Emperor and letting you sit on the Dragon Throne. As for whether you want to waste this chance on Ma Ku Xuan, that’s up to you.”

Song Jixin rose as well, “I’ll remember that.”

Outside Old Dragon City, the Dragon Ascending Platform by the sea had become a forbidden zone by the order of Prince Song Mu himself.

As such, very few could ascend to enjoy the view. If one were a Qi Cultivator, they needed to be at least at the Nascent Soul stage.

Strangely, the person who visited the platform most often was actually a maid from the prince’s residence.

However, she was of exceptional beauty. It was said she was an ordinary girl, yet she outshone even accomplished female cultivators, exuding an ethereal charm.

Today, she stood alone on the highest point of the Dragon Ascending Platform.

Surveying her surroundings, she detected no prying eyes.

The former Golden Core offering from the Fu family, who had previously resided near the Dragon Ascending Platform, had already moved elsewhere.

Now in Old Dragon City, if even she could not sense any signs, it was certain that no one was employing any extraordinary techniques to observe the mountains and rivers.

Her golden eyes shimmered with fluctuating light.

She wore a dragon robe refined from all the clouds of the Fu family.

In this Baoping Continent, she was not someone who could be easily killed; rather, she could choose to kill whoever she wished!

Yet, that petty degree of cultivation still felt meaningless.

Even with Fan Junmao, who had become the Mountain Lord of Nanyue, she still felt bound.

And Fan Junmao’s rate of breaking through would be swift thereafter.

Zhi Gui lowered her head, a four-legged snake with horns sprouting from its forehead lay obediently at her feet.

She lifted her foot and stomped down heavily; the poor little snake had no courage to flee and could only thrash its tail in a show of helplessness, causing the entire Dragon Ascending Platform to tremble.

“You think wagging your tail will save you? You’re worse off than that mud-legged fool who hides to cry!” 

With added force, she pressed down until the creature sank into the ground.

Zhi Gui withdrew her foot and turned, staring blankly toward the distant southern horizon, a vague sky beyond.

The person who could once control her had died. A truly pathetic death.

The other person, who could also manage her, had never known the truth—how ridiculous.

**Under the Night Sky.**

On a vessel from the Fan family in Old Dragon City, on Guihua Island, Madam Gui and her only disciple, Jin Su, sat together in a serene residence.

Jin Su laughed, “Master, it’s not the Mid-Autumn Festival, so why are we eating mooncakes?”

Holding a mooncake in one hand and a delicate gesture in the other, Madam Gui chewed slowly, replying gently, “Just because I want to.”

Jin Su displayed some playful charm only in her master’s presence, stretching her legs, interlocking her fingers, and yawning widely while gazing up at the tall ancient osmanthus tree on the island, which seemed to cradle the moon.

Madam Gui took a gentle bite of the mooncake and teased, “You still prefer Sun Jiashu over Fan Er, don’t you?”

Jin Su’s face flushed slightly as she protested, “Master, that’s quite inappropriate! It’s really out of season!”

Madam Gui chuckled, “Alright, I’ll admit my fault.”

Jin Su continued to gaze at the stunning scenery where the moon and osmanthus tree embraced, casually asking, “Master, I’ve heard every world has its moon. The wild world has three moons, plus so many blessed lands and caves. Which one is the real moon? Or are they all real? Can everyone everywhere look up at the same moon?”

Madam Gui smiled, “Perhaps the true moon resides in one’s heart.”

---

Under the moon, Jin Su felt a sudden wistfulness, “If it could always be like this, that would be wonderful.”

Madam Gui smiled, “The moon waxes and wanes, and ultimately, it’s merely the moon in people’s eyes, not the same in their hearts. There’s never a definite answer as to which one is better.”

The elegant Madam Gui, whose beauty was not absolute but whose demeanor was graceful, looked up at the moon.

Having grown accustomed to observing humanity from the moon, gazing down at it from afar wasn’t too bad either.

The reopening of the shipping routes in Qingluan Kingdom had finally achieved its goal, and all the various departments and officials involved were pleased.

Initially, no one had high hopes for the project; it was difficult and involved offending many people, which could lead to endless troubles. A misstep could leave a stain on one’s official robe that couldn’t be washed away.

At first, only two officials were sent from the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Works, along with the governor of the state where the shipping route was located.

The highest-ranking among them was merely these three.

Additionally, there was Liu Qingfeng, who had been “promoted” from a county magistrate to a shipping assistant official.

However, as unexpected smooth sailing continued, the hats of the officials overseeing the project grew larger, with deputy ministers from the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Works scrambling to leave the capital to endure hardships in that place known for its swarms of insects and leeches. Eventually, the Minister of Works personally led the charge, reportedly taking charge of everything himself. After much hardship, the shipping route finally opened, and upon returning to the capital, the virtuous minister brought back only a single umbrella for the people.

His Majesty the Emperor was delighted, promoting several officials. Those who already held significant ranks received gifts from the emperor.

Of course, except for Liu Qingfeng, who had wisely stayed in the background and hadn’t benefited much. In fact, the three officials who had initially worked alongside him felt somewhat awkward. However, after spending a long time together with Liu Qingfeng, they ultimately found some leftover flavor in their interactions and didn’t mention anything untoward in their reports. As for why Liu Qingfeng acted this way, even after the three were promoted, they still couldn’t figure it out.

Logically speaking, an official who had been excluded from the family tree and whose reputation had sunk to the bottom should have gained something for their concrete contributions. Why would they refuse what should be theirs? Most people would clamor for what they didn’t deserve. Yet, Liu Qingfeng, who seemed to have become as thin as a peasant after the ordeal, didn't seem to care. Moreover, regarding the shipping matter, he was the sole mastermind behind every detail and trend, yet he ended up being the one who gained the least in terms of rank, merely being transferred from a shipping assistant official to a county governor’s assistant.

Today, Liu Qingfeng was on his way to a remote county in the Qingluan Kingdom for his new appointment, riding in a horse-drawn carriage driven by Wang Yifu, a former county constable.

Liu Su, who had been Liu Qingfeng’s steward since childhood, sat beside the burly man, while the master sat in the back of the carriage reading. The bumpy road was taxing on the eyes, but Liu Su couldn’t help but lift the curtain to remind his master. However, Liu Qingfeng always said he would only read for a while, and eventually, Liu Su gave up.

Throughout the journey, his master didn’t read any sage texts but instead flipped through and organized all the official routes of Qingluan Kingdom, even collecting a large stack of geographical maps. He would also extract all records related to roads from the messy local chronicles, tracing and recording everything, regardless of whether the roads were still in use or had been abandoned.

Liu Su felt he would probably never understand what his master was thinking.

Liu Su had a good relationship with Wang Yifu, both having once served as influential county constables, yet he was still willing to accompany his master to face the hardships of the shipping canal, not gaining any promotions but valuing loyalty.

Thus, Liu Su still preferred to call Wang Yifu “County Constable Wang.”

Wang Yifu didn’t comment on it.

Liu Su, who had been Liu Qingfeng’s steward since he left Shiziyuan, had traveled around for studies, then rushed to the capital for exams, and eventually arrived at the county office.

Now still in his youth, though he was no longer as young as before.

The boy felt a bit melancholic today, particularly because his master, still quite young and far from forty, had already begun to show signs of gray.

What saddened Liu Su even more was that his master’s current appearance bore little resemblance to the elegant scholar of years past.

At dusk, the carriage arrived at a relay station. After submitting the official documents, the three of them rested there for the night. The station's clerks failed to recognize the Liu family man as an official. Instead, it was the quiet carriage driver who seemed more official.

Feeling that Liu Qingfeng’s status was neither too high nor too low, the station provided two rooms for them, neither too good nor too bad.

After dinner, Liu Qingfeng began to light a lamp to read, taking out ink and brushes.

Wang Yifu sat beside him, smiling, “Liu, no matter what, even if it’s just to protect your eyes while reading, you should give cultivation a try. You don’t need to save this little bit of celestial currency for the Great Li; after all, the Great Li court will only earn more.”

Liu Qingfeng put down his book, shaking his head, “Let’s skip it. I know my own aptitude for cultivation.”

This was the second time Wang Yifu had said this, and since Liu Qingfeng still refused, Wang Yifu didn’t push it further.

Liu Qingfeng rarely opened the book but, unable to resist the urge to keep reading, eventually closed it, wiping his brow. “How about a drink?”

Wang Yifu was pleasantly surprised, laughing, “In terms of knowledge and governance, a hundred of me wouldn’t compare to one Liu. But when it comes to drinking, it’s the other way around.”

Liu Qingfeng smiled ruefully, “You’re already cursing before drinking.”

Wang Yifu was once a pivotal general from the furthest north of the Baoping Continent, a pillar of the nation.

The Great Li Dynasty had initially only been a vassal of the Lu Dynasty!

Liu Su brought over a bowl of cheap local wine, which was affordable and not too bad in taste.

Liu Su poured wine for both, then looked at the two masters sitting still, puzzled, “Aren’t we drinking? There are no side dishes unless I dare to call on those officials at the relay station who look at me askance.”

Liu Qingfeng laughed, “True hospitality means not seating anyone until the host arrives. If you don’t sit down, neither Wang nor I would dare touch our bowls.”

Liu Su laughed heartily and plopped down. 

His master had a surprisingly entertaining side when it came to jokes.

Unfortunately, such moments were rare.

Liu Su had a weak constitution regarding alcohol and didn’t love drinking, so he had to keep an eye on his master. If Wang Yifu pressured him to drink too much, Liu Su would have to intervene.

Fortunately, Liu Qingfeng drank slowly, and Wang Yifu never insisted, giving the youth some relief.

In his excitement, Liu Su ended up drinking a bit too much.

Wang Yifu put down his bowl, “Liu, I’ve always been curious about your views on the mountains.”

Liu Qingfeng took a sip of wine, slowly replying, “How I view the mountains isn’t very significant. The line between the mountains and the plains isn’t as vast as we imagine. Those below are short-lived, while those above live much longer.”

Wang Yifu asked, “What about the immortal techniques? Don’t you discuss those? Isn’t the difference in lifespan more apparent?”

Liu Qingfeng shook his head and smiled, “I’m a scholar. When confronted with soldiers on the battlefield, if I were struck down by a sword, Wang, do you think the disparity is that great?”

Wang Yifu nodded, “So in your eyes, those who cultivate in the mountains are merely a bit stronger, that’s all?”

Liu Qingfeng ceased drinking, “Rich people in the mountains, especially those who are wealthy enough to rival nations, and the so-called enlightened ones among them, both receive the great blessings of heaven and earth, living without worry and having enough food for several lifetimes. They should think about opening their wallets to give back a little, maintaining reciprocity, and ensuring a steady flow. It’s not that I expect everyone to emulate the moral saints; it’s simply that doing so is a way to send out small coins and welcome in large ones, ultimately a matter of profit and gaining more benefits.”

Liu Qingfeng continued, “Indulgence towards those who break the rules is the greatest harm to those who adhere to them.”

At this point, he turned to the now half-drunken youth, Liu Su, and smiled, “So how do we determine that the rules we set are certainly good and right?”

“Master, you think about it yourself. I don’t want to; I can’t figure it out either,” Liu Su replied, shaking his head and grinning, “But you should think less, otherwise, I’ll be exhausted too.”

Liu Qingfeng waved his hand, exasperated, “Just keep drinking, and don’t think about anything.”

Wang Yifu raised his bowl, toasting Liu Qingfeng.

Liu Qingfeng also lifted his bowl, “I’ll drink within my limits; there’s no need for pleasantries with County Constable Wang.”

Eventually, Liu Su ended up sprawled on the table, sound asleep.

Wang Yifu rarely enjoyed such a long chat with Liu Qingfeng, feeling remarkably at ease.

Liu Qingfeng spoke of what Wang Yifu considered grand matters and achievements with a calm demeanor. However, when discussing a trivial matter Wang had never considered, Liu Qingfeng surprisingly took a deep gulp of wine, truly drowning his sorrows.

“The disappearance of dialects across Baoping Continent is painful. Many larger and smaller dialects, even fragmented literary lines, have a chance for remediation as long as the books are still in circulation. But once those dialects tied to numerous customs vanish, they are gone for good.”

Liu Qingfeng stared blankly out the window.

The window was closed, and the scholar could not see the moonlight outside.

He had no idea if it was brighter than yesterday or dimmer than tomorrow.

Xu Yuanxia returned to her hometown and opened a martial arts school. However, this schoolmaster preferred to shut the door and secretly write, only to be found by the servants cleaning the rooms, turning her into a minor joke.

Although the big-bearded man was rather old, his appearance was hardly impressive. However, there were still many young women willing to marry him.

After all, he looked like someone who wasn’t short of money, and the key was that this older man was well-connected, able to chat with local gangs, county officials, and the children of noble families in the same city.

An old bachelor, as long as he had a full wallet, would have a hard time remaining single.

In the deep mountains surrounding the city, a group of celestial beings occupied a secluded mountain peak, which swiftly became shrouded in mist.

Soon, the common folk flocked there, some bowing and praying for a connection with the immortals, while others sought assistance in dispelling disasters, only to be turned away.

Then, one day, a celestial being wandered down the mountain and took a liking to a potential cultivator—a common girl from the county city. She was unwilling at first, intent on marrying her childhood sweetheart and leading a stable life. The young man she fancied happened to be studying martial arts in Xu Yuanxia's school, currently a temporary outer disciple.

What left Xu Yuanxia both amused and exasperated was that she had managed to persuade the group of Qi practitioners using reason and her dagger, successfully convincing them not to resort to force but to conduct a mutually agreeable transaction. Those cultivators, though not highly ranked, were reasonable, and they agreed peacefully.

However, Xu Yuanxia’s school soon attracted a large crowd of relatives from the girl’s parents, causing chaos and despair, particularly an elderly woman who fainted from crying, nearly unable to catch her breath.

Eventually, the girl changed her mind, whether persuaded by her parents or otherwise, and agreed to go to the mountain to practice immortal arts.

Xu Yuanxia found herself caught in the middle.

Yet, having roamed the martial world for a long time, she didn’t feel particularly upset.

That pair had promised each other sweet nothings under the willows, and both seemed to have envisioned a bright future.

One would become a heroic figure in the martial world, opening a school of their own, while the other would learn immortal arts on the mountain, perhaps even supporting one another in the future.

Yet, less than a year later, she came to visit less frequently.

A year later, she completely stopped coming. Even when the young man sought her out, he couldn’t reach the mountain or see her.

The once teetotaling youth started to drink in solitude.

Xu Yuanxia could only sigh.

That girl was indeed born with potential; once following her master and senior brothers, she had already learned to ride the wind above the county city.

Aspiring to explore famous mountains and learn the ways of alchemy.

One time, as the evening glow lit the sky, the young man looked up, tears streaming down his face.

Xu Yuanxia had no way to console him.

That night, Xu Yuanxia lay on the roof, drinking alone.

She found herself missing her two younger friends from the martial world.

Zhang Shanfeng, who was both foolish and clever.

Chen Ping’an, who was eternally deep in thought.

She wondered how much wine she would need to consume the next time they all gathered.

The world felt strange in every corner, and Xu Yuanxia only hoped that her two friends would traverse mountains and rivers without any obstacles.

The big-bearded man tilted his head, stroking his chin, truthfully thinking that after he shaved, he was the most handsome among the three.

---

**In a Lane of Shujian Lake.**

Living door to door were two individuals, one big and one small: a young man and a snot-nosed child squatting in a courtyard, roasting corn, breaking it in half, and the young man handing the child one half.

The child, feeling indignant, refused to take it, “Why should I eat the smaller half, Gu? You’re older; can’t you let me have the bigger one? Do you still want to be my brother-in-law?!”

Gu Can laughed, “In my life, I’ve never eaten the smaller half of anything; it’s always the bigger one. We’re familiar, but I can’t make an exception.”

The child glanced at Gu Can, seeing he wasn’t joking, decided to back down. After all, the corn belonged to Gu Can, and he hadn’t spent a single coin on it. The child nibbling on the corn mumbled, “You’re so rich, yet you still eat roasted corn?”

Gu Can nodded, “Of course I eat. When I’m starving, I’d even eat dirt.”

The child rolled his eyes, “All talk; no girl will like you.”

What the child didn’t know was that this seemingly decent young man, barely good enough for his sister, had once been the notorious Gu Da Demon of Shujian Lake. After a period of quiet, he soon became an influential figure in the area, navigating relationships and connections smoothly, all while remaining behind the scenes.

Once the true Jiang Zhenjun, Liu Zhimao, had completed his retreat, he had fully recognized Gu Can as his only direct disciple, leaving behind the foundational “True Scripture of River Crossing” for him.

Senior sister Tian Hujun had come to see Gu Can as her last lifeline.

The young general who had once been responsible for guarding Yunlou City had since left, but the new Great Li martial general was clearly the friend of Gu Can, who would toast and drink with him, treating him even more respectfully than he did with the previous general. Gu Can understood that this was a friend, yet not quite, but it didn’t really matter.

The new emperor of the Shihou Kingdom, Han Jingling, the youngest ceremonial minister Huang He, and many young “old friends” from Shujian Lake had all come to seek out Gu Can privately.

What mattered most was the unexpected guest who had come knocking.

Gu Can had recognized the visitor’s identity at a glance, even if the other had used some illusions.

Gu Can did not pretend to be ignorant; he directly bowed and greeted, “Greetings, Sect Master Jiang.”

Jiang Shangzhen was quite pleased and not only entered but also drank with Gu Can, creating a private space while treating Gu Can as an insider, freely sharing some shocking words.

He complained that he felt too constrained in his current role, and that the location of Yuguizong’s old sect master was terribly misguided, as any other location would have sufficed. Why did it have to be here, making it impossible for him to sleep?

Gu Can simply listened, holding his cup without drinking.

This gesture was simple: it was Gu Can, situated in Shujian Lake, who would be the person Jiang Shangzhen deemed proper.

As for how Gu Can felt at the moment, what he sought in his heart, or what his future intentions were, none of that was important.

Thus, Jiang Shangzhen merely visited, shared a few drinks, and then left.

Gu Can, regarding these matters, never concealed anything from Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi, but Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi were initially quite worried that Gu Can would revert to the previous Gu Can from Qingxia Island, rather than the one who had traversed thousands of mountains and rivers alongside Chen Ping’an.

Fortunately, Gu Can did not give them any cause for concern. Aside from the endless extraordinary social gatherings and drinking bouts, he still allocated at least six months every year to travel with Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi around the mountains and rivers near Shujian Lake.

During this time, apart from enjoying the scenic landscapes, they also encountered many unexpected conflicts, one of which was a horrific tragedy.

Gu Can did not resort to his previous ways of avoiding trouble or brushing it off with a laugh. This time, he wielded the ordinary sword at his waist and, with a single stroke, killed twelve Qi practitioners, each with a single strike. Among them was even a Dragon Gate cultivator that both Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi greatly feared, yet before Gu Can, who was not even a proper sword cultivator, they couldn’t even muster any counterattack.

That time, even Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi felt a sense of satisfaction; those cultivators deserved to die.

In the end, with his back to them, sword in hand, Gu Can took his time to sheathe his sword, gently shaking off the blood from the blade.

When Gu Can turned around, having already sheathed his sword, he smiled, “Let’s go. The heavens nourish life, and the earth will take care of the dead; no need to worry.”

Now, Gu Can’s holdings were considerable; aside from the Qingxia Island that Liu Zhimao had fought to reclaim, he also owned several other islands, so he rarely returned to this small alley but made it a point to stay a night whenever he returned from his travels or found a moment of leisure.

Today, there was plenty of corn, and although he could only eat half of the smaller one each time, the child still managed to fill his belly.

Gu Can pondered a matter.

He had carefully placed two pieces in Zhengyang Mountain and Qingfeng City, not knowing when he could trigger those lines of connection.

Since there was no rush, he would take it slow.

The child burped in satisfaction and then sat down on the ground, looking at the man named Gu beside him, asking, “Who else is so easy to talk to that you can eat the bigger halves of corn?”

Gu Can glanced at him.

The child suddenly felt a bit scared.

Gu Can laughed and pointed at the child’s face, “Wipe your nose.”

The child immediately sniffed, not even needing to use his sleeve or the back of his hand.

Gu Can thought for a moment and said, “It seems to me that it will be hard for me to return to the way things used to be with that person. But it’s fine; as long as I don’t make any major mistakes—none at all—he will always keep me in mind. How many good friends in this world drift apart without any fuss? It's not that they fall out; they simply grow distant. I feel more at ease now that we’re this way, neither too close nor too far.”

Gu Can looked at the timid child sitting on the ground, smiling, “What do you think, little snot-nosed worm?”

The child, for some reason, felt that the current Gu Can was unrecognizable, so he no longer dared to act as before, saying softly, “Whatever you say is fine. I’m young and don’t understand; I’ll listen to you.”

Gu Can chuckled, “Quite smart, but still not as good as me.”

Now, the child was no longer afraid, rolling his eyes, “I’m smart? Go ask about my teacher’s ruler!”

Gu Can nodded, “That’s quite reasonable.”

Suddenly, Gu Can stood up and told the child, “Go sit in my room for a while, but remember not to rummage through anything.”

The child, confused, still obediently went to Gu Can’s room, standing on tiptoes by the windowsill, worried that Gu Can might have something to do.

So indeed, he was a clever child.

There is a kind of cleverness that is innate.

Gu Can looked toward the door and said, “It’s fine if you won’t come in; I’ll just see you when I go out.”

A timid and weak scholar peeked out, introducing himself, “My name is Liu Chicheng, from Baishan Kingdom, not far from Guanhushu Academy. I was originally traveling to Shujian Lake, but ended up here out of confusion. It’s all a misunderstanding; I’m not a thief, but a genuine scholar with a name!”

Gu Can squinted, clasping his hands in greeting, “Since there’s no need for juniors to go out, please step in, senior.”

The scholar’s demeanor instantly changed, and he strode across the threshold.

“Liu Chicheng” exclaimed in astonishment, “Such a formidable young person!”

Gu Can rose with a smile, “As long as you don’t think, ‘This boy cannot be kept,’ we’re good.”

Upon hearing this, Liu Chicheng burst into laughter, “Interesting, interesting! By the way, I originally came to retrieve the ‘True Scripture of River Crossing’ because I was worried it might fall into the wrong hands. I didn’t expect this to be a heaven-sent opportunity. Little boy, you seem young but have quite a high cultivation level; what’s your name?”

Gu Can, with a strange expression, recalled something, “Senior, are you looking to take on disciples again?”

Liu Chicheng’s expression shifted slightly, feeling a bit awkward, and sighed, “This situation is quite embarrassing.”

Gu Can replied, “I respectfully request you to speak properly and discuss matters thoroughly.”

At this point, Gu Can paused for a moment, locking eyes with the undoubtedly high-ranking “scholar,” no longer displaying any fear, “Otherwise, senior, you might find yourself momentarily pleased but ultimately disappointed.”

Liu Chicheng nodded, “That makes sense.”

Then Liu Chicheng laughed, “You shouldn’t stay in this small pond; you should go to Baidi City in the Central Divine Continent.”

---

The power of the Great Li Dynasty was on the rise.

Recently, in the old Zhongyue territory of Great Li, a continuous light rain fell, becoming quite bothersome.

The original five sacred mountains of Great Li had now been reduced to mere mountain deities, and with the new North Sacred Mountain, they were about to select three peaks as the mountains of the Crown Prince, further worrying certain mountain deities.

Previously, the entire Baoping Continent had not had such concerns. In the mighty Central Divine Continent, history had seen similar actions, but the results had not been significant, even leading to long-lasting repercussions. This endeavor was costly and labor-intensive, often unappreciated, and could easily lead to unforeseen troubles. A slight misstep could leave a stain on one’s official robe that couldn't be washed away.

The reasoning was simple: these subordinate mountain ranges were often extremely far from the grand mountains and were not adjacent to them. The old mountain gods were already nominally dependent on the grand mountain deity, which diminished their stature. Once they became the mountains of the Crown Prince, the regulations and constraints would increase manifold. The mountain deities could come and go as they pleased, and the grand mountain deity could swiftly arrive at their own peak. According to the rites established by the Confucian sages, only the Ministry of Rites could assess and evaluate the merits and demerits of local mountain deities.

Although the Minister of Rites and the deputy ministers were careful not to neglect this matter—after all, it was a national affair regarding worship and war—most of the specific tasks were handled by the small clerks of the shrine, particularly by a low-ranking yet powerful clerk.

Moreover, the mountain deities and the grand mountains could freely seize the mountain and water fortunes from the smaller mountain shrines. Naturally, the grand mountain deities could also reciprocate by offering resources to the Crown Prince’s mountains. However, even if the mountain deity spoke with confidence, could one truly trust their words?

A young woman in a green dress, holding an oil-paper umbrella, walked along the mountain paths.

Her purpose was to negotiate first. If reasoning failed, then they would eat something.

After all, the entire old Zhongyue region was considered the new territory of Longquan Sword Sect.

On her way north, she casually picked up a little girl and brought her along.

The little girl, born of a charming lineage, cheerfully asked, “Sister Xiu, do you know what our paper umbrella is also called?”

Ruan Xiu, distracted, replied, “I don’t know.”

“Flower Holder. Isn’t it vivid and lovely?”

“I suppose so.”

“Sister Xiu, why do you seem so unenergetic?”

“The snacks are finished, and I’m hungry.”

“That makes sense. Sister Xiu, have you heard that eating yangmei without spitting out the seeds and eating watermelon without spitting out the seeds can help stave off hunger even more?”

Ruan Xiu chuckled and patted the little girl’s head, “You’re quite clever.”

The little girl looked at her muddy shoes, feeling annoyed, “It’s frustrating.”

Ruan Xiu nodded, “Yes, it is quite frustrating.”

The little girl stepped further away and, with determination, began stomping heavily in the mud, asking, “Sister Xiu, do you have someone you like?”

Ruan Xiu smiled, narrowing her eyes, “Yes.”

The little girl turned around, raising the umbrella high and examining Ruan Xiu’s profile for a long time before gently saying, “Sister Xiu, you’re so wonderful. Why doesn’t he accompany you when you go out?”

Ruan Xiu pondered for a moment and replied, “He’s always in my heart.”

The little girl pressed her finger to her cheek, making a face, “Sister Xiu, you’re a woman; don’t you feel shy?”

Ruan Xiu began to brush off the questions of the inquisitive little girl, “Oh, that’s how it is.”

**In the capital of the Great Sui Dynasty.**

The girl who year after year wore red clothes or padded red jackets wasn’t at the cliffside academy today but had instead gone to a common orange grove on the outskirts of the capital.

Unfortunately, it wasn’t winter yet; otherwise, the oranges hanging from the trees would look like little girls in red dresses.

Li Baoping had come on a whim, recalling a place she had passed earlier and wanting to take a look. After seeing it, she felt satisfied and turned to return.

On the way, she encountered two people who made her even happier.

One was a little black ball carrying a small bamboo box and holding a walking stick.

The other was a fellow who had been nicknamed “Big White Goose” by the little black ball.

Pei Qian sprinted toward Li Baoping.

Li Baoping rubbed Pei Qian’s head, “You’ve grown a bit taller, haven’t you? Take care; don’t turn from a short winter melon into a tall bamboo pole!”

Pei Qian, who had originally been brimming with excitement, immediately grew anxious.

Li Baoping pinched Pei Qian’s cheeks and laughed, “Just teasing you; why is your little head still so slow?”

Pei Qian had a lot to say to her sister Baoping.

Li Baoping motioned for Pei Qian to calm down and turned to ask, “How’s the little master uncle?”

Cui Dongshan nodded with a smile, “The little master uncle, the teacher, and the master will come back.”

Pei Qian angrily retorted, “Don’t put ‘master’ before ‘teacher’!”

Li Baoping watched the two playfully chasing each other and took a deep breath, rubbing her face vigorously. Unfortunately, the little master uncle wasn’t around.

Otherwise, when winter came, it would snow, and they could all have a snowball fight together.

As she grew up, she realized she had seen the least of the little master uncle, especially since she was part of his group.

On the large tree at the peak of the cliff academy, Cui Dongshan, Li Baoping, and Pei Qian climbed up together, feeling quite familiar.

They sat side by side on a branch. Pei Qian wanted to sit in the middle, but Cui Dongshan couldn’t outmaneuver her. Li Baoping yielded, and Pei Qian got her way, feeling overjoyed.

Li Baoping had already listened to Pei Qian’s stories about the mountains and rivers all the way, and they had just finished talking about taking the ferry from Niujiao Mountain to Old Dragon City.

Cui Dongshan leaned back, holding his head with both hands and swinging his legs.

Under the night sky of Great Sui’s capital, the lights shone brightly.

Perhaps this bustling place in the vast world was much like this.

Gentle winds and soft moonlight.

A prosperous and peaceful era.

Cui Dongshan closed his eyes, unwilling to continue watching.

He had seen far too much.

He only wished that the teacher would return home one day in the beautiful season when the grass grows and the warblers sing.

 ### Chapter 745: The Mutual Questioning of Swords

Chen Ping'an made a solitary journey to the Sword Qi Great Wall, witnessing the legendary Questioning of Swords firsthand.

Who could possibly engage in a sword challenge with the Sword Qi Great Wall?

It was hard to believe that any sects from the vast realm of Haoran would take it seriously; they would likely laugh it off as a joke.

The Questioning of Swords in the Wilds was undeniably real, starting under a night sky where the moon shone dimly.

From his vantage point on the southern battlefield, Chen Ping'an first saw scattered glimmers of sword light flickering into existence. Gradually, more lights appeared, reminiscent of the lanterns he had seen floating downriver during his travels in the Haoran realm, each a tiny beacon of hope gathered together, sparkling like stars, vying for brilliance against the sun and moon.

Ultimately, numerous personal flying swords traced brilliant arcs as they slowly made their way toward the Sword Qi Great Wall, merging into a dazzling river of stars.

From the castle’s heights, it seemed as if an immortal was gazing down from the heavens at the lights of the world below.

If one ignored the enemy lines and simply focused on the breathtaking scene, it was truly magnificent.

As the Hidden Official, Chen Ping'an did not need to draw his sword, nor could he, for he would soon return to the summer palace on the northern side of the wall.

It was not that Miao and Lin Junbi had failed to perform well; it was simply that Chen Ping'an found it hard to relax. This was a kind of obsession that had its pros and cons, and he felt it wasn't the right time for any changes.

Much like the way he had stubbornly sought external help in the past, he needed to adapt gradually.

Standing atop the castle wall near the thatched cottage, Chen Ping'an sighed, “This mutual questioning of swords has never been seen before, nor will it be again.”

The elder sword immortal chuckled, “It's true that there will be no successors, but as for there being no predecessors, that’s debatable. In the past, when mortal sword cultivators raised their swords to question the heavens, swords fell from the sky like a golden rain. That was even more spectacular. Do you know who presided over the formations and maintained order during that time? There were the Greatest Sage, the Dao Ancestor, the Buddha, and nearly half of the ancestors from the Hundred Schools of Thought. Each one selfless, each one honored death.”

Chen Ping'an recalled his earlier journey with Cui Dongshan, where the white-clad youth had rambled on about many strange tales.

Chen Ping'an whispered, “It is said that at that time, there was no concept of the Three Teachings or the Hundred Schools. Each school of thought was just a nascent form, whether we sword cultivators or those practicing Qi, or the dragons of the four seas, all fought side by side as allies. Even the Wilds paused their conflicts with humanity then, not offering help, but neither hindering us.”

Chen Qingdu nodded, a rare look of nostalgia crossing his face. “I, the Dragon Lord, and those long-forgotten sword cultivators of the past, one after another, ascended after drawing their swords.”

Chen Ping'an squatted down, touching the cool surface of the Sword Qi Great Wall, looking up at the southern battlefield. “Elder Sword Immortal, at that time, everyone was struggling for survival; otherwise, they wouldn’t have lived. I don’t mean to belittle your accomplishments, nor would I dare or wish to. Now, after ten thousand years, I have traversed the Three Continents and seen many different worlds; I can say that overall, the Haoran realm is still good, stable. Elder Sword Immortal, you all are like the elders of a large family. You can see clearly the rights and wrongs of our younger generation. In fact, you’ve been quite forgiving. But I still hope you won’t be disappointed; if you lose all hope, we will have far fewer opportunities to realize our mistakes and correct them.”

Chen Qingdu remained silent.

Chen Ping'an hesitated, wanting to say more.

Chen Qingdu smiled, “Since you are now the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall, you should have the courage to speak frankly.”

Chen Ping'an pressed his palm against the ground and said, “I still believe the world is getting better, step by step. I have faith in that. Elder Sword Immortal, please don’t think that these ten thousand years have been filled with only solitude. Behind you, the Haoran realm has remained stable for ten thousand years, with smoke curling from the kitchens below and the celestial aura lingering above the mountains. Generally, everyone has their hopes and dreams. Even I, as a child, feared nothing and thought I would die, yet I later became an apprentice at the Dragon Kiln and started thinking about earning and saving money, wanting to live well, didn’t I? The thoughts of people over there may be as tangled as wild grass, but they still need soil to take root and sprout, right? As long as there’s soil, countless possibilities will emerge.”

Chen Ping'an looked up and said, “Elder Sword Immortal, do what you think is right. But please don’t be disappointed, don’t be sad, alright?”

The elder squatted down, placing his hand on the young man's head, chuckling, “Young people are just young people, having seen little of the world. Even having experienced the sword technique I taught you, you still don’t know the true heart of a sword cultivator.”

The elder withdrew his hand. “Sword cultivators of my age have all endured and persevered through the deepest despair and the harshest trials. Criminals? In the beginning, who among the mortals on this earth wasn’t a criminal, living day to day? So, there’s no need to speak of great disappointment. Sure, there may be some, but it’s definitely not as thorough as you think. Over the past ten thousand years, what I’ve seen more is a flicker of hope here, a glimmer of hope over there. From the ashes of hope, next year, a spring grass might sprout. While the Sword Qi Great Wall may not hold such a scene, even from the castle wall, I can still catch the scent of spring grass from the Haoran realm every year.”

Chen Ping'an was momentarily stunned and couldn’t help but laugh, “I never expected Elder Sword Immortal to say such things; it’s quite... poetic!”

Chen Qingdu chuckled, “Let me tell you two interesting little things, but remember not to be too eager to reveal heavenly secrets.”

Chen Ping'an straightened, “Elder Sword Immortal, please go ahead.”

However, Chen Qingdu changed his mind, shaking his head, “We’ll talk about it later.”

As Chen Ping'an was about to take his leave, Chen Qingdu suddenly said, “In the Liujin realm, sword cultivators carry two personal flying swords. Reaching the peak of the seventh realm, they are merely pure martial artists. That’s still not enough.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “Elder Sword Immortal, please don’t be too demanding of me. Among my peers, I’m already quite remarkable. In the path of martial arts, at least I can still catch a glimpse of Cao Ci’s figure. As a lower five realms qi practitioner, to earn a chance for you to draw your sword as the Hidden Official, I wouldn’t dare to claim great merit, but I think my hard work isn’t excessive, right? Moreover, I see no harm in the Liujin realm; it’s about accumulating virtue and luck, and if I’m not careful…”

Chen Qingdu cut off Chen Ping'an’s whimsical thoughts, shaking his head, “You don’t have the fate to comprehend the mysteries of the ‘Preserving People’s Realm’ and shouldn’t expect to ascend to the upper five realms in one fell swoop.”

Chen Ping'an forced a smile, “Elder Sword Immortal, can’t you wait until I reach the fourth realm before saying this?”

Chen Qingdu replied, “Have you thought about who will take the last of the three sword cultivator slots?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “I can’t think of anyone at the moment.”

Chen Qingdu waved his hand dismissively, “If you can’t figure out something so trivial, what use is there for you as the Hidden Official? Go to the summer palace and use your brain more. Strive to ascend to the qi practitioner’s cave dwelling realm and the martial artist’s far-traveling realm sooner.”

After bidding farewell, Chen Ping'an asked one matter, which Chen Qingdu agreed to.

It concerned the matter of leaving the castle to kill demons; Chen Qingdu said it was fine. As long as the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage were willing and it didn’t interfere with important matters, it was acceptable.

As Chen Ping'an summoned his talisman boat, he glanced at the thatched cottage. His senior brother was still in seclusion recovering from injuries; Xiao Shen’s punch had indeed been ruthless. Elder Sword Immortal had said that if it were someone like Yue Qing, they would have been dead by now, and even Lu Zhi and Nalan Shaowei would have fallen in rank.

Just as Chen Ping'an’s talisman boat left the northern castle wall, someone landed on the ferry, riding the wind.

“Are you leaving?” Chen Ping'an asked.

Liu Xianyang nodded, “I expect to depart in a couple of days. The coastal defense of Nanposha Continent has already been put on the agenda, and there are a ton of matters to attend to.”

Chen Ping'an brought up an earlier topic, “Regarding the sword questioning at Zhengyang Mountain, you must wait for me and be extremely careful.”

Liu Xianyang frowned, “If you haven’t seen my sword technique, that’s one thing. But is it really necessary to be so cautious when dealing with a single Zhengyang Mountain?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Absolutely. Trust me.”

Liu Xianyang asked, “Is a single Li Tuanjing enough to suppress Zhengyang Mountain for hundreds of years to warrant such seriousness from us?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Liu Xianyang, the earlier conflict between Fenglei Garden and Zhengyang Mountain is nothing compared to what lies ahead in our questioning of swords at Zhengyang Mountain. Aside from Zhengyang Mountain’s long-hidden foundation, we must also consider the broader context. Both Zhengyang Mountain and the Xu family of Qingfeng City are undoubtedly candidates for sect status in Baoping Continent. In particular, Zhengyang Mountain will likely divide the majority of the swordsmanship fortune of the Zhu Ying Dynasty. This is something even the Longquan Sword Sect cannot achieve. No matter how much the Dali Song Emperor reveres Master Ruan, he absolutely won’t allow the Longquan Sword Sect to dominate; it’s been arranged that the old Zhongyue region is under Longquan’s territory. Aside from Master Ruan’s sect having too few members to grow, this move by the Dali Song Emperor also allows Zhengyang Mountain to seize the opportunity to recruit sword cultivators from the Zhu Ying Dynasty. Once they join a sect, Zhengyang Mountain will be tied to the fate of the Dali Song dynasty. Is this still the same kind of rivalry that Li Tuanjing and the Zhengyang Mountain sword cultivators had in the past?”

Chen Ping'an sighed, shaking his head. “I can’t say more. Just know that Zhengyang Mountain is a crucial part of a significant layout for the Dali Dynasty; it’s indispensable. When the time comes for you and me to question swords, what we’ll truly be confronting is not just the mountain itself but the protective array of Zhengyang Mountain and those elder sword cultivators.”

Liu Xianyang stared blankly at Chen Ping'an.

“Is there something wrong?” Chen Ping'an asked.

Liu Xianyang laughed, “Did you misunderstand? Who said that a question of swords has to be resolved in one go? If I poke them in the backside with my sword today and sense trouble, I can run away, then come back tomorrow and stab them again. Isn’t that also a questioning of swords? Must it be as you say, to kill them in one blow, shattering their sword heart and their spirit in one go? Chen Ping'an, now that you are among the mountain folk, have you become so concerned about face? Have you forgotten how you and I have never been those types of people who care about appearances? I, Liu Xianyang, am not someone whose nature you’re unaware of. My speech may not be in line, but my actions are still reliable.”

Liu Xianyang’s smile faded, “Whatever you do, don’t just think about being flawless; is it really just about being flawless? If you’re mistaken, it’s merely something you didn’t anticipate, yet you’re doing what’s best. I’m the kind of person who is half confused and half clever, not seeking perfection. If I can deal with myself, I can handle opponents too. Life can be lived chaotically or with meticulousness; both ways are valid. You should learn how to make the difficult days more bearable. I’m not saying you’re wrong; I’m just saying that while you may be right more often than I, every person needs to take a break and catch their breath occasionally. This is not something that’s often discussed in books, but I figured it out long ago, just never had the chance to tell you.”

Chen Ping'an stood there for a moment, taken aback.

Liu Xianyang chuckled, “You’re no longer a little snot-nosed kid; you’re still Liu Da Ye after all.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I understand.”

Liu Xianyang shook his head, “It’s not just about understanding; you need to remember.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “You’re in charge.”

The two sat facing each other in the talisman boat.

Life is full of separations.

Only lamenting the spring wind and autumn flowers, the coming and going is truly easy. I wish for the spring flowers and autumn moon to reunite without difficulty.

After a moment of silence, Liu Xianyang blinked, “Is there none?”

Chen Ping'an looked confused.

Liu Xianyang glanced around, ensuring no one was watching, then extended a finger to poke.

Chen Ping'an swiftly slapped Liu Xianyang's hand away and lowered his voice, “Are you trying to get us killed? Don’t involve me!”

Liu Xianyang was taken aback, “We haven’t even held hands yet? I’m not well-read and have been honest since childhood; don’t trick me.”

Chen Ping'an felt like he had been struck by lightning.

Liu Xianyang looked sorrowful, “You’re worse off than I am; it’s not just being single, it’s worse than being single.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “You should find my future sister-in-law before saying that.”

Liu Xianyang shook his head, leaning back and lying down in the ferry, “It’s hard to find a woman who doesn’t covet my looks.”

The talisman boat hovered at the entrance of the summer palace.

Following the rules of the Hidden Official lineage, no outsiders were allowed to enter the palace without permission.

The two descended gracefully. Chen Ping'an stowed his talisman boat into his sleeve, while Liu Xianyang did not immediately take off.

Standing before Chen Ping'an, Liu Xianyang adjusted his collar, patted his shoulder, and nodded, saying, “I’m leaving. When I’m not around, don’t just take care of others; remember to take care of yourself.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “You take care too.”

As Liu Xianyang was about to turn, Chen Ping'an tossed him a unique seal, smiling, “This is one of a kind; remember to keep it safe. You might sell it for a fortune someday.”

Liu Xianyang didn’t even glance at it, stowing it away in his sleeve as he rode off into the wind.

Chen Ping'an stood there for a long time, unable to withdraw his gaze.

The doors of the summer palace remained wide open, with no gatekeeper in sight.

Chen Ping'an walked towards the great hall, where Miao was waiting. “Hidden Official, the necessary arrangements have been completed. We just discussed that each time, three people will go to the castle to draw swords. It won’t delay our plans, and observing the battlefield from a distance is not as effective as being there in person to capture the details.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “Who are the first three?”

Miao stood up, with Mi Yu and Dong Buduo following suit.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Go ahead, but Mi Sword Immortal should not rush; it should be Deng Liang instead. Remember, do not linger there. After a ten-day period, the next team must include Mi Sword Immortal, Pang Yuanji, and Lin Junbi. Following them will be Song Gaoyuan, Cao Gun, and Xuan Can. Lastly, there will be Gu Jianlong, Wang Xinshui, and Guo Zhujiao, and I might join as well.”

Chen Ping'an had no doubts about Miao and the other three, particularly Miao, who was greatly admired by both Elder Sword Immortal and A Liang as a promising young sword cultivator.

However, he felt some apprehension regarding Luo Zhenyi and the other two, so he placed them behind Deng Liang and Song Gaoyuan. But placing Luo Zhenyi and the others last, even behind Gu Jianlong and his companions, felt excessive. Having Luo Zhenyi and the others together was a kind of supplementary measure.

Therefore, it was reasonable for Luo Zhenyi and the others to harbor some resentment towards him, the Hidden Official, as long as it didn’t interfere with the overall situation, and they did what needed to be done. Chen Ping'an didn’t mind this small grievance. In fact, he felt a strong admiration and longing for these sword cultivators, who were most familiar with the customs of the Wilds, akin to Chen Sanqiu.

However, when it came to specific matters, one should always remain vigilant. Thus, if Luo Zhenyi and the others felt displeased with him, it was of no concern. If he were to be a universally praised good person, he shouldn’t have taken on the role of the Hidden Official.

Miao and the others exited the great hall, soaring away from the summer palace.

Sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage were mostly young yet wise; they all understood that this battle would last a long time, at least three to five years, or even a decade or more—no one could say for sure. The intensity of the conflict would still exceed expectations.

Huang Luan held the fort, with a torrent of magical tools from the demon race and the current Lotus Flower Abbot serving as the backbone of the demon army, leading tens of thousands of demon sword cultivators in questioning swords at the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Moreover, after two rounds of battle, millions of demons from the Wilds, under the guidance and coercion of those demon cultivators, would leave their homeland, heading towards the Sword Qi Great Wall. It was said that along the roads leading to the northern battlefield, countless skeletons piled up on either side.

Ants gnawing on an elephant, the demons’ wait-and-see approach has now turned into a burden for the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Once the Questioning of Swords in the Wilds was over, the sword cultivators on the castle wall would have to engage in close combat.

Chen Ping'an didn’t immediately step into the great hall; he took a stroll outside in the plaza.

The Hidden Official lineage had grown accustomed to their Hidden Official acting this way, often found walking alone in the courtyard, drawing circles as he walked.

Pondering some matters, he spoke a few words with the sword cultivators inside the building.

Chen Ping'an recalled a conversation from earlier in the great hall, initiated by Miao and Deng Liang.

Miao had a far-sighted perspective. When the Hidden Official lineage had roughly deduced the next ant siege battle, Miao said that the situation in the Wilds was no simple matter of changing the timing and geography of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Deng Liang made a comparison. He recounted how during his early years as a rogue cultivator traveling in the mountains, he passed by a county town and witnessed a brutal street fight between two sects, resulting in nearly a hundred casualties. The victorious side not only took all the territory but also instilled a great sense of fear in the neighboring counties, quickly infiltrating them. Local officials, the rogue forces, and wealthy merchants all feared those desperate criminals, each with their own schemes, many actively seeking to appease them. Over time, the surrounding county factions lost their momentum and territory was gradually consumed.

At that time, Chen Ping'an had remained silent.

Using this comparison for the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Wilds, and the Haoran realm was somewhat inappropriate. However, the conclusion drawn was correct.

Chen Ping'an had consulted the sages of Confucianism and Buddhism stationed at the castle, and they believed that the Wilds aimed to break through the Sword Qi Great Wall and the Upside-Down Mountain, establishing a foothold in the Haoran realm. They sought to transform the Haoran realm’s territory into that of the Wilds, thereby altering the balance of power between the two realms and seizing advantages—essentially creating opportunities for the peak demons while reducing the need for transcendental forces to dominate. Thus, the more demons that died at the Sword Qi Great Wall, even those who perished in vain, would not die in vain; they would serve a great purpose in the future.

Inside the building, Mi Yu, who had been acting as a gatekeeper, suddenly asked, “Hidden Official, have you become a sword cultivator?”

Chen Ping'an turned to him, asking, “Why do you say that?”

Mi Yu replied, “If you take a chance and consider it a certainty, it often becomes reality.”

Chen Ping'an did not provide an answer, merely smiling, “It’s a pity that Mi Sword Immortal isn’t going to my hometown’s mountain peak to serve as a guardian.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 746: The Young Man in the Master Position

A group of over ten people crossed the blazing summer sun of the Sword Qi Great Wall and arrived at the snow-laden slopes of the Inverted Mountain. 

They all cast illusions, choosing the deep midnight of the Inverted Mountain to go directly to one of the four private residences, the Chunfan Pavilion. Among the group were Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan, the two deities of wealth from the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Aside from the solitary peak where the Great Heaven Monarch resided, no one noticed the sudden appearance of these crossing dragons. 

The Great Heaven Monarch overlooked the entrance, accompanied by an old master holding a golden dust whisk, who softly inquired, “Master, could this cause any trouble?” 

The Great Heaven Monarch chuckled coldly. “Who would dare to cause trouble? Those merchants blinded by greed? Would they even have the guts?” 

The old master rubbed the golden threads made from the whiskers of a dragon, “If it’s just a show of force, it might not achieve anything.” 

The Great Heaven Monarch turned his gaze to one of the men in the group and nodded. 

The man glanced up at the Great Heaven Monarch at the peak of the solitary mountain and nodded back. 

It seemed the Great Heaven Monarch had only come to meet this person for a moment; after exchanging pleasantries, he turned and left, saying, “After I enter seclusion, you manage things. It’s simple: don’t interfere in anything.” 

The old master, who was the Great Heaven Monarch’s first disciple, was taken aback for a moment, then switched hands to hold the dust whisk and bowed lightly, murmuring, “I will follow the master’s order.” 

Unable to resist, the old master asked, “Master, what about Uncle Jiang?” 

Once the master entered seclusion, no one could control that 'little Taoist boy' from the White Jade Capital. 

After all, this true monarch, in both seniority and cultivation, dared not intervene. The further apart the lineage, the harder it was to reason. 

The Great Heaven Monarch turned to glance at the old door, where a young Taoist boy sat on a mat, perusing a book while chatting with the sword immortal Zhang Lu, who was drinking nearby about trivial matters in the text. The Great Heaven Monarch hesitated a moment before saying, “Just let him be. Over the hundreds of years guarding the Inverted Mountain, Jiang Yunsheng has been quite honest. If he were back in his hometown, a few Inverted Mountains wouldn't suffice for his mischief. My little uncle dotes on him; every time he goes to the Grand Xuan Dao for trouble, he has to bring Jiang Yunsheng along. If it weren’t for Master Sun having murderous intent towards Jiang Yunsheng, my little uncle would’ve kept Jiang Yunsheng from having to seek refuge in this Haoran world.” 

The Grand Xuan Dao, the lineage of sword immortals, and one of the ten great sword immortals of the Qingming world, Sun Daoist. 

The old master sighed, “If Uncle Jiang survives this great calamity, he will surely have future blessings.” 

Fortune and misfortune are intertwined; with a different world, the fortunes might turn. Perhaps many years ago, when the ancestor brought Uncle Jiang to the Grand Xuan Dao to “make a scene,” it had provoked Sun Daoist's murderous intent, which was, in fact, deliberate. 

At Sun Daoist’s level, killing intent could be manifested as long as he was away from the White Jade Capital, especially close to his own Daoist temple, he could completely manifest the Dao and change his fortunes. 

The actions of the three-palm teacher ancestor might be called the brushstrokes of a deity. 

Of course, that presupposes they could safely escort Jiang Yunsheng out of the Qingming world. 

The Great Heaven Monarch had already entered seclusion, leaving the old master at the railing, gazing down at the entire Inverted Mountain. People only knew that the Inverted Mountain was the largest seal of a mountain character, but few realized that the catching-and-releasing pavilion and the elk cliff among the eight scenic spots, along with the solitary peak beneath him, formed an ancient formation inherited from the lineage of the Three Mountains and Nine Lords, ultimately crafting a presence akin to an ancient ascension platform. 

The old master, a disciple of the Great Heaven Monarch collected in the Haoran world, called this place home. However, he was quite similar to the old boatman who supported the three-palm teaching Lu Chen out to sea; for cultivators, where they were born was their first home, and where they practiced after ascending the mountain was their true home where their heart felt at peace. Thus, whether it was the old true monarch stationed at the Inverted Mountain or the old boatman wandering the seas year after year, both longed to go to the Qingming world to cultivate the Dao, but the Dao was high, and the journey was long; without someone to guide them, how could they ascend to another world? 

The old master watched as those sneaky cultivators infiltrated the Inverted Mountain, feeling it was rather pointless. Since the master had given the order to not interfere in anything, the old master operated his divine powers and directly manifested at the still of the night in the catching-and-releasing pavilion. In an instant, this true monarch, who had hunted countless dragons to refine his life dust whisk, appeared over the ocean. With nothing to do, he intended to take a distant look at the Dragon Valley. 

If it hadn’t been for Jiang Yunsheng saying something to this true monarch, all the true dragon descendants within the Dragon Valley should have perished long ago. The true monarch just needed to wait for the opportunity and intercept those rain-dispensing old dragons one by one; that dust whisk should have been an immortal-grade weapon. 

Little by little, he gathered equipment from the mountain, accumulating enough to successfully refine it into an immortal-grade weapon. This was the true monarch’s skill. 

Recalling that ancient secret, the old master stood atop the vast ocean, sighing deeply. 

Back then, the only one capable of persuading that sword immortal to sheath his sword was none other than Lu Chen. 

Beyond the Six Extremes, wandering in the land of No Where, amidst the vast wilderness. 

In communion with the spirits of heaven and earth, that three-palm teaching truly deserved to be called the “Ultimate Being.” 

It was no wonder that in this master ancestor’s eyes, all the immortal sects in the Haoran world were merely nests built by sparrows. 

The magical techniques of the immortal sect, capable of moving mountains and oceans, were nothing more than a mole drinking water. 

The more the old master reflected on the teachings of that three-palm teaching, the more he felt his insignificance; for a moment, he was somewhat dazed. 

The young Taoist boy exclaimed, turning to look at the high railing at the top of the solitary peak, calculating something with his fingers, utterly inexplicable. 

The sword immortal Zhang Lu curiously asked, “What’s wrong?” 

The young Taoist boy replied, “It’s somewhat like the gradual enlightenment and sudden realization of Buddhism; somewhat, but it still lacks a decisive wake-up call.” 

Zhang Lu laughed, “After accumulating hundreds of years of goodwill, can’t you lend a hand?” 

The young Taoist boy shook his head. “Not everyone can deliver a wake-up call. I certainly don’t have that skill. If I hit him slightly askew, the one who is only gradually realizing will end up with a head full of bumps.” 

Zhang Lu laughed, “Keep reading. Generally, whenever the little heavenly deity in the book stays by the lake or the deep pool, there’s bound to be a beauty bathing.” 

The young Taoist boy didn’t immediately turn the pages but suddenly said, “Take it easy. The other party has twice chosen not to go this way.” 

Zhang Lu grinned, “Still as sentimental as ever, huh? This kid probably won’t genuinely admire your Daoist teachings in his entire life.” 

The young Taoist boy shook his head, “It’s just about matters, not people. It’s not about that; pure feelings, pure nature, pure truth, and pure sincerity are all good seedlings for cultivating the Dao. In fact, our Daoist teachings are broader and deeper than you can imagine, higher and farther. You can’t dismiss our Dao just because my skills are lacking.” 

Zhang Lu yawned, “If you don’t turn the pages soon, I won’t last through the night.” 

The young Taoist boy began to flip through the book. 

Not long before this, a ferry boat from the Fuyou Continent had just sailed over a thousand miles from the Inverted Mountain when it suddenly received a flying sword message from one of the sect’s private residences. The old Nascent Soul cultivator pondered for a long time. Sure enough, the ferry’s sword room received many flying swords from fellow cultivators. In the end, after weighing the pros and cons, the old Nascent Soul cultivator chose to quietly leave the ferry and return to the Inverted Mountain. 

Not only the Water Cave but also several ferry talkers who had just left the Inverted Mountain had received messages from their respective channels, needing to return to the Inverted Mountain for an urgent matter. 

In fact, almost all the crossing ferries that had been near the Inverted Mountain or recently left were invited to Shao Yunyan’s Springfan Pavilion “as guests.” 

The invitee was neither Yan Ming nor Nalan Caihuan, but rather the “Sword Qi Great Wall.” 

This was an unprecedented oddity in the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

This was no trivial matter that could be easily dismissed; many great merchants were curious about who would be the spokesperson for the Sword Qi Great Wall this time. Who had the qualification? Was it the old sword immortal Nalan Shaowei, who had once been schemed against by the then obscure ancestor of the Water Cave, only to end up in utter embarrassment? If it were this person, it would save them trouble. 

Thus, among all the cross-continental ferries that received the news, those from the Central Divine Continent and the Aiai Continent were the most numerous. Each sent someone to secretly return, mostly meeting halfway to speculate on the Sword Qi Great Wall’s intentions. There was certainly no danger to their lives; the Sword Qi Great Wall wouldn’t go insane. What they feared was if the Sword Qi Great Wall made a reckless move, causing complications and delaying everyone’s steady earnings. However, if they could decisively quell the Sword Qi Great Wall’s arrogance, it would be a great blessing for them all. 

Shao Yunyan, the owner of Springfan Pavilion, personally welcomed guests at the door, leading a stream of arriving guests to settle in various areas of the residence with a few remaining trusted elders. Shao Yunyan appeared amiable, and many ferry managers felt somewhat overwhelmed by the treatment. The sword immortal Shao Yunyan, owing to his treasured gourd vine, had many sects in the Haoran world and renowned sword immortals from across a continent owing him favors, thus making Springfan Pavilion incomparable to the Plum Blossom Garden or the Water Crystal Palace of the Rain Dragon Sect. Those who could stay at the Inverted Mountain were all undoubtedly wealthy, while those who could enter Springfan Pavilion often had achieved the Dao with bright prospects ahead. 

Springfan Pavilion had arranged over ten secluded courtyards, each gathering the talkers of the various ferries together. 

Before each person entered their courtyard, the sword immortal Shao Yunyan would smile and say, “Everyone, drink tea and wine for a moment, make yourselves at home. Just wait a bit, and we will go to the main hall of Springfan Pavilion to discuss matters together.” 

The old Nascent Soul cultivator Bai Xi from the Water Cave in the southwest of Fuyou Continent, unaware of what the sword immortal Shao planned, entered the courtyard and, upon stepping inside, saw someone sitting in the main room, looking up at him. 

Bai Xi's heart tightened, and he silently cursed. 

That person was none other than the sword immortal Xie Zhi from Fuyou Continent! 

He came from a genuine wild cultivator background; even after becoming a sword immortal, he still had no intention of establishing a sect and preferred to wander. Eventually, he ended up at the Sword Qi Great Wall, having had no interactions with any immortal sects in Fuyou Continent, particularly as Xie Zhi had never hidden his disdain for the Water Cave and had never even exchanged pleasantries with its ancestor. 

In the main room, several ferry managers, sharing Bai Xi’s feelings, sat stiffly, unable to relax. 

Xie Zhi’s first words made everyone uneasy. 

“Earning money through ability is good, but if you can’t spend it, that’s very bad.” 

Bai Xi suppressed his fear and displeasure, asking in a low voice, “Sword Immortal Xie, why do you say this?” 

Xie Zhi glanced at him sideways. “I’m a wild cultivator who eats from the mountains and fields; I can’t stand seeing those esteemed immortal teachers making big bucks. Is that reason enough?” 

Bai Xi was left utterly speechless. 

In another courtyard, a ferry manager from the Golden Armor Continent entered and also saw a woman with her eyes closed and a sword on her back sitting in the main room. 

Her looks were unremarkable, but what mattered was the long sword “Fuyou” behind her, renowned across the Golden Armor and Fuyou Continents, which involved an incredibly captivating backstory. To have a sword named after an entire continent, and for the sword’s owner not to be from that continent, how could there not be legendary tales? 

The woman sword immortal was Song Ping. 

Once, a great poet from Fuyou Continent saw Song Ping from afar and could not forget her for life. He longed for her for many years, passionately devoted, and never took a wife, writing poems in her praise that could fill a collection; among them, the line “I once saw you and dreamed of you again, your eyes like a bright light” was especially famous. Not only that, but he also wrote several poems in her tone, which were quite moving, bringing both laughter and pity. 

Inside, several old cultivators from the cross-continental ferries looked gloomy, and upon seeing the newly arrived kindred spirit, their expressions did not improve. 

They did not have the leisure and sentimentality of that poet, lost in longing. They felt that today’s reunion at the Inverted Mountain, this Springfan Pavilion, was easy to enter but difficult to leave. 

Song Ping opened her eyes, extended her two fingers, picked up a nearby wine cup, and drank it all in one go. “Have all arrived? Quite a few. Then let’s toast first; drink some wine before discussing matters.” 

When a sword immortal personally invites others to drink, they usually have to drink first. 

After the toasts, who knows if there will be any penalties for drinking? 

The sword immortal Pu He from the Northwest Liuxia Continent, a gaunt and tall old man, wasn’t seated inside but stood at the door, admiring the snow. A few old ferry cultivators could only stand in the corridor, watching the heavy snow fall. 

Pu He was once the most temperamental sword immortal of Liuxia Continent, killing based on whims. It was said he only stayed to hide and cultivate at the Sword Qi Great Wall after losing to another sword immortal in a duel. 

After waiting for everyone to arrive, he said, “You’re all businesspeople who like to trade, so since we’re all fellow countrymen, why not do me a favor? Will you sell or not?” 

The crowd exchanged glances. 

One person, gathering his courage, cupped his hands and asked softly, “May I ask if Sword Immortal Pu is speaking as a sword cultivator of the Sword Qi Great Wall or as a sword immortal of Liuxia Continent?” 

Pu He shot a sideways glance at this “uncooperative” Nascent Soul cultivator. “Get lost and send a message to your ancestor Li Xun that when I return to Liuxia Continent, I’ll bring a few friends and take my sword to visit your ancestral hall.” 

Before the Nascent Soul cultivator could salvage the situation, Pu He unsheathed his life sword, pointing the tip at the manager’s brow, as if to detain him on the spot, making him freeze in place. Then Pu He grabbed him by the neck and casually tossed him onto the street outside Springfan Pavilion, speaking with rippling intent, “Your ferry is called ‘Mizui,’ right? Looks rather flimsy; how about I help you replace it? Can a hiding, concealed Yu Pujing sword cultivator like Lingran protect you?” 

The ferry manager, who had been about to leave in resentment, stood frozen in place. 

This cross-continental ferry was vital to the sect, known for its size and strength, named Mizui because it had accumulated many magical treasures. Because of this, the sect had secretly hired a Yu Pujing sword immortal, Lingran, to be stationed there. However, aside from himself, no one else in the ferry knew about it, as that sword immortal rarely made his presence known. 

The Nascent Soul cultivator gritted his teeth and re-entered Springfan Pavilion, planning to apologize to Pu He. 

He wasn’t afraid of any actions from the Sword Qi Great Wall, as no one would die; it wouldn’t be specifically targeting him. However, he feared Pu He’s relentless approach would drag him and the whole sect into a fate worse than death. 

The four troublesome spirits on the mountain were the most difficult to deal with, especially the sword cultivators. 

Such a shameless sword immortal from his own continent, once they’d become entangled in a grudge, would undoubtedly be hard to shake off; it was quite evident. 

So, would such a favor be sold or not? 

Several managers from the Nansuo Continent were chatting merrily in a courtyard with their sociable sword immortal, Yuan Qingshu. 

Yuan Qingshu, unlike Pu He, Xie Zhi, and Song Ping, was very genial, not only bringing wine but also engaging in light-hearted conversation, saying that the Sword Qi Great Wall’s well-known bamboo sea cave wine was the best. He just mentioned one thing at the end: that his six direct disciples could visit the residences of the seated friends and serve as honored guests. As for today’s main business, there was no rush; they would go to the main hall to discuss after drinking. 

From the Aiai Continent, the number of ferry managers was quite large, second only to those from the Central Divine Continent. 

The female sword immortal Xie Songhua was rather peculiar. Growing up in Aiai Continent, she rose to prominence in the Central Divine Continent and never identified herself as an Aiai sword cultivator, claiming that a continent that couldn’t even hold on to the word “North” didn’t deserve her recognition as an Aiai person. 

Generally speaking, sword immortals with such a bad temper would struggle to thrive in the prosperous and renowned markets of Aiai Continent. After all, the immortal sects in Aiai Continent weren’t afraid of individual strong cultivators but could hardly resist the likes of Xie Songhua, who had several good sisters sharing her disdain for Aiai sword cultivators. One of them was a pure warrior fond of hunting demons in the frigid north, and she just happened to have a close relationship with the Liu family of Aiai Continent. 

Moreover, Xie Songhua had always looked down upon Aiai sword cultivators, but this time at the Sword Qi Great Wall, she surprisingly smiled at the younger generation, including Deng Liang. 

Once Xie Songhua saw seven or eight people take their seats, her opening statement was quite imposing. “I have drawn my sword twice at the Sword Qi Great Wall and have already achieved the merit of defeating a great demon at the Immortal Realm. Consider it a success and retreat.” 

This didn’t cause an uproar, but everyone’s heart sank. 

Currently, the Sword Qi Great Wall was on high alert, and information flowed very limitedly. Moreover, no one dared to investigate indiscriminately. However, one thing had already become common knowledge among travelers at the Inverted Mountain. 

It was indeed Xie Songhua’s sword that had destroyed a Yu Pujing sword cultivator’s foundation in the wild, and according to the rules of the Sword Qi Great Wall, such achievements equaled that of a half-immortal great demon. 

Moreover, this was the personal merit in the current offensive and defensive battle of the entire Sword Qi Great Wall. 

To be honest, the merchants from Aiai only felt a sense of pride in this connection, but what they truly sought was the business opportunities within it. 

Whoever could attract Xie Songhua to serve as a revered guest at the mountain gate would undoubtedly make a fortune! 

However, no one dared to speak up; everyone knew Xie Songhua’s temperament, and saying such a thing would just invite disaster. 

Why did everyone feel apprehensive? 

It was because this kind of indifferent sword immortal, who had no fixed residence, actively showing up to “talk business” could only mean trouble. 

Sure enough. 

“I owe someone a favor, so this time, returning to Aiai Continent, I’ll accompany you all.” 

What followed in Xie Songhua’s words sent chills down everyone’s spines. “He said, those who do business all want to earn as much as possible, and it’s reasonable; no faults can be found. He won’t hold it against you, and can even empathize with you. It’s impossible to have a deal where both parties can profit without any issues; if anything goes wrong, it’s not your fault, but his. So, you can not only relax, but you’ll also have unexpected rewards. After we finish discussing matters in the main hall, those of you who are short of money, those who are the most needy, I’ll personally escort this cross-continental ferry back to Aiai Continent, as it’s a favor I owe.” 

With a bamboo sword box slung over her shoulder, Xie Songhua looked at everyone, sneering, “If the escort doesn’t go well, it’ll be my fault for not being skilled enough.” 

The managers of the North Julu Continent gathered after everyone had arrived when they met Liu Caizhu, the master of the Floating Sword Lake. 

Everyone stood up respectfully, cupping their hands in greeting. 

It wasn’t because she was a Yu Pujing sword immortal or a sect master that warranted such heartfelt respect, but rather because Li Cai dared to come to the Sword Qi Great Wall, that was all. 

Li Cai did not take a seat; after returning the greetings, she picked up a prepared jug of wine and straightforwardly said, “Han Huaizi won’t be returning, and I should be leaving soon as well. That’s all said; let’s drink.” 

The sword immortal Wei Jin, seeing the two ferry managers from Longcheng, did not discuss business matters but asked about the recent situation in the Treasure Bottle Continent. He then said, “Once I ascend to the Immortal Realm, if I don’t die at the Sword Qi Great Wall, I will make a trip to the North Julu Continent to duel with Tian Jun Xie Shi once again.” 

The two old cultivators, already somewhat reserved, felt increasingly uneasy. 

The Eastern Treasure Bottle Continent was the smallest continent, while the sword immortal Wei Jin was regarded as an exceptionally rare talented sword immortal in the history of Treasure Bottle Continent. 

Who would dare to take it lightly? 

Once Wei Jin reached the Immortal Realm, the former leaders among the cultivators of the continent, such as the Shenzhao Sect’s Qi Zhen and the present one who had risen from a crossing dragon to a local snake, would have to reconsider their positions. 

In fact, the Longcheng ferry had recently received some credible news; the Yu Pujing sword immortal Wei Jin had already hit a bottleneck. 

Tonight, Wei Jin even confronted this barrier directly, making the two Longcheng ferry managers even more anxious. 

Wei Jin, with no ties or enmities, speaking to these two insignificant managers about breaking through was quite puzzling. 

Yet he certainly wished to inquire about the sword of Tian Jun Xie Shi. 

In the largest courtyard of Springfan Pavilion, all the ferry managers from the Central Divine Continent were present. 

Compared to the other courtyards’ tense and eerie atmosphere, the merchants and cultivators here appeared calm. Two older Yu Pujing cultivators, Wu Qiu and Tang Feiqian, were personally stationed there for their sect’s cross-continental ferry. However, they held no official capacity, as it would be too embarrassing. Among them, Wu Qiu was a sword cultivator accustomed to storms, and the two old immortals sat next to each other, chatting and laughing, their voices not low. 

Aside from their identities from the Central Divine Continent, the treatment by the Sword Qi Great Wall’s hosts simply could not suppress them. 

Just a Yu Pujing sword cultivator, Mi Yu, was two realms apart from the previously expected old sword immortal Nalan Shaowei. 

With the addition of Shao Yuan Dynasty’s sword immortal Ku Xia, who would help whom was still uncertain. Why did the Sword Qi Great Wall send such two people to host? This indicated that tonight in Springfan Pavilion, there would be no major upheaval. 

Wu Qiu and Tang Feiqian, both old cultivators of the fifth realm, felt a little more relaxed and began to scrutinize the young sword immortal Mi Yu and a female Nascent Soul cultivator beside him, who had excellent qualifications but insisted on becoming a ferry manager, which was a thankless task. Why was that? It was simply that she had fallen for someone. 

A lovesick person, unfortunate to fall for a romantic, was truly suffering. Why bother? There were countless talents in the Central Divine Continent; how could she be infatuated with a Mi Yu? 

If Mi Yu could leave the Sword Qi Great Wall and was willing to marry her, she would indeed be considered to have climbed high, but though Mi Yu was flirtatious, he was ultimately a sword immortal of the Sword Qi Great Wall; how could he possibly go to the Central Divine Continent? 

The sword immortal Ku Xia was not good with words. 

According to the prior instruction, he didn’t need to say much and just sat there as a mere companion. 

Wu Qiu turned to the nearby sword immortal Ku Xia and asked with a smile, “Where are Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan? Are they waiting for us to finish our tea in the main hall?” 

Ku Xia shook his head, “Not sure.” 

Wu Qiu nodded, “No rush.” 

Although they were both Yu Pujing sword immortals, Ku Xia had an extra identity that made others not dare to belittle him. 

He was the nephew of Zhou Shenzhi, one of the ten of the Central Divine Continent. 

Regardless of how Zhou regarded this “foolish and incompetent” nephew, it wasn’t a reason for outsiders to look down on Ku Xia. 

The more the good-natured Ku Xia was, the less he should provoke enmity. 

Thus, it seemed that the Sword Qi Great Wall had wisely sent Ku Xia to host them; it was not an insignificant hand. 

However, once both sides began to negotiate finances, the face that Ku Xia would show might not hold much weight, after all, he wasn’t Zhou Shenzhi. 

Ku Xia sighed internally. 

In a while, when they saw that young man, it would be their turn to have headaches. 

With complicated feelings, the sword immortal Ku Xia even felt that if that day had come when the Sword Qi Great Wall faced off against that future ancestor of the Water Cave from Fuyou Continent, it shouldn’t have been the old sword immortal Nalan Shaowei but the young man who should be in the main hall of Springfan Pavilion now; it would be a good match. 

Because Ku Xia truly couldn’t imagine Lin Junbi would ever have a day of being subordinate to others. 

The female Nascent Soul cultivator spoke to Mi Yu through her heart, “Mi Yu, you will pay the price for this. I will risk the sect’s punishment afterward to make you lose face. Moreover, I may not even have to pay any price, but you certainly won’t be able to bear the consequences.” 

At this point, the girl’s tone had a touch of delight. “What a perfect example of ‘not getting revenge until the time is right’. Mi Yu, did you not expect that you would have this day?” 

Mi Yu looked at the girl, feeling regret, heartbroken, and spoke to her with heartfelt words in a quiet voice, “I never expected that the gentle girl back then would become so unlovable. I can only blame myself.” 

The girl was left speechless, her face growing even more resentful, her heart full of bitterness. Many words that nearly came to her lips seemed to shatter into pieces, and she could not utter a single word. 

To fall for someone and have deep feelings for a person, only to be unloved in return, felt as if one would never have a chance in this life. 

Mi Yu fell silent, his expression gloomy. He glanced at her, then turned his gaze away slightly, as if only daring to catch her out of the corner of his eye, able to see her but not daring to look directly. 

In the main hall of Springfan Pavilion. 

A young man leaned against the door, an ancient jade token hanging from his waist. 

Within, Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan had already taken their seats, but both couldn’t sit in the master position at the four-sword table. Moreover, the positions of these two Nascent Soul sword cultivators were relatively far back. 

Nalan Caihuan felt somewhat awkward, while Yan Ming was indifferent. 

Earlier, she had been tricked by that babbling fellow once, and when Nalan Caihuan reported the details to Nalan Shaowei afterward, her ancestor had looked at her as if she were a fool for quite a while. Frustrated, Nalan Caihuan wanted to overturn all the agreements they had made, but unexpectedly, her ancestor instead told her to just let it be and proceed as discussed. 

Standing beside the young man was the owner of Springfan Pavilion, sword immortal Shao Yunyan. 

He didn’t mind whether he was being usurped. 

The two met for the first time and were chatting amiably about Liu Jinglong from the Northern Julu Continent and the Fairy of Watering River, Lu Sui, feeling quite compatible. 

Shao Yunyan said that Liu Jinglong had a promising Dao ahead of him and was likely to become the first ascended sword immortal of the Northern Julu Continent. 

The young man remarked that the Fairy Lu was gentle and understanding, a perfect match for Liu Jinglong, and casually praised Lu Sui’s master. 

Shao Yunyan was indifferent to whether the words were sincere; after several hundred years, even if it was just polite conversation, it was still nice to hear. 

The heavy snow of the Inverted Mountain continued to fall without pause. 

Beauties and heavy snow have always made a perfect pair throughout history. 

After chatting about the gourd vine and the fine wines of the Yellow Liang blessed land, Shao Yunyan asked, “Should we call them over now?” 

The young man smiled, “Not in a rush; we can’t let the sword immortals make a wasted trip to the Inverted Mountain. Let those who are used to dealing with immortal money feel more of the sword immortal’s grace.” 

Shao Yunyan nodded, “It’s about time.” 

The previously chatty young man fell silent on this matter, merely placing his hands within his sleeves, lightly tapping his fingers together, gazing up at the heavy snow. 

If only each snowflake were a piece of money. 

Shao Yunyan also looked up, enjoying this rare moment of tranquility. 

Last year’s old dream, I dreamt of being by my side, feeling suddenly in a foreign land. 

This year’s new dream, I suddenly arrived at the old mountain head of Watering River, seeing her still smile like a flower. 

The young man suddenly said, “Sword Immortal Shao, after tonight’s matter, regarding the issue you promised the Sword Qi Great Wall in the past, we can negotiate to change it. The matter remains the same, but the outcome can be different. No party will be put in a difficult position.” 

Shao Yunyan frowned and asked, “You have the final say?” 

The young man smiled, “I don’t have the final say; who does?” 

Shao Yunyan felt a sense of relief. 

Originally, the sword immortal, who had already decided to die at the Inverted Mountain, took a few steps back and cupped his hands in gratitude to the young man. 

The young man accepted it calmly, extending his hand from his sleeve to return the salute. 

As long as it didn’t involve life and death, Shao Yunyan felt unburdened. He then offered, “As for business matters, let’s count it as a share of Springfan Pavilion.” 

The young man immediately placed his hand on Shao Yunyan’s arm, saying, “How righteous! Truly sword immortal grace. This snow wasn’t a waste, I’ve been waiting for your words for a long time.” 

Shao Yunyan was caught off guard. 

He sensed that the group of merchants would face a terrible disaster tonight. 

For aside from the hosts, there were now two additional sword immortals returning from viewing the scenery, Sun Juyuan and Gao Kui. 

In addition, there was sword immortal Mi Yu from the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

From the Central Divine Continent, Shao Yuan Dynasty’s Ku Xia. 

From the Nansuo Continent, Yuan Qingshu; from the Northwest Liuxia Continent, Pu He; from the Golden Armor Continent, Song Ping; from the Southwest Fuyou Continent, Xie Zhi; from the Aiai Continent, female sword immortal Xie Songhua; and from the North Julu Continent, the master of Floating Sword Lake, Li Cai. 

And the great sword immortal Wei Jin from the Treasure Bottle Continent. 

A large group of sword immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall and foreign sword immortals suddenly left the Sword Qi Great Wall and gathered at the Inverted Mountain. 

This was an unprecedented event in the history of the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Shao Yunyan bid farewell and entered the room first, taking a seat in his chair, which was quite near the main door. 

Tonight, none of the sword immortals visiting the Inverted Mountain were from the Tongye Continent. 

Because Tongye Continent was the only continent without cross-continental ferries, nor did it have sword immortals practicing at the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

It was quite a coincidence. 

However, the man who had nodded at the Great Heaven Monarch now had his sword Qi reined in, quietly leaving the Inverted Mountain with a mid-fifth realm sword cultivator from Tongye Continent. They were headed for the now most destitute Tongye Sect of Tongye Continent, not to ask about swords this time, but to help draw swords. This would aid not only Tongye Continent but also the Haoran world. If not for this, would he ever wish to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall, letting his junior brother remain behind alone? 

Scholars fear righteousness the most. 

Zuo, who had always considered himself a scholar from the mountains, was not some sword immortal from the mountain. 

More importantly, once he arrived at Tongye Continent, he could draw his sword more freely and perhaps even fight alone, without any sword immortals beside him. 

His junior brother had schemed, wanting him to go to Nansuo Continent, claiming that the situation there would be the most perilous. However, after hearing a certain little brat’s words, he decided to go to Tongye Continent instead. 

His junior brother must be regretting it immensely. 

Chen Qingdu had been in high spirits at the time. 

This journey would be long. 

They would not make any stops along the way through Dragon Valley or the Rain Dragon Sect. 

Only pausing slightly at Lu Hua Island to confirm whether it was truly the legendary high being of the Daoist sect or the so-called hidden great demon of Cui Dongshan. 

If it were a high being, they could sit and discuss the Dao; if it were a great demon, they could cut it down with a sword. 

Zuo rarely faced any difficulties. 

This time, accompanying Zuo was a young Golden Core sword cultivator from Tongye Continent, named Wang Shizi. Though young, he was of similar age to Zuo and not particularly old. 

This young Golden Core cultivator, Wang Shizi, was a wild cultivator; at this age, becoming a Golden Core sword cultivator could be considered a genius. 

Unfortunately, upon arriving at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he found no fellow countrymen and felt quite awkward in a place full of sword immortals. With a low realm, he felt out of place, and aside from Wei Jin from Treasure Bottle Continent, he had no other sword cultivators to interact with, so he naturally didn’t dare to approach Wei Jin for casual conversation. 

In his ten-plus years at the Sword Qi Great Wall, he had truly spent most of his time in solitary cultivation, with minimal returns from hunting demons on the city walls, just enough to support his stay. 

However, things had improved slightly in the past two years, as he had often gone to a small tavern to buy wine. Without friends or companions, unless there were few customers, it was hard to get a seat to drink; he could only squat by the roadside, sipping wine and eating plain noodles. Compared to his past loneliness, this was truly a better experience. 

To return to his hometown this time was a tremendous surprise; he never expected to travel with the great sword immortal Zuo. 

Nonetheless, Wang Shizi understood the stakes and remained silent throughout the journey. 

As they approached Dragon Valley, Zuo said, “There’s no need to be overly cautious; if you have any doubts about your cultivation, just ask.” 

Wang Shizi replied softly, “I’m still at a low realm; it’s not a big deal. I can wait until we reach Tongye Continent to ask.” 

Zuo did not press this peer sword cultivator further. 

Zuo turned back to glance at the direction of the Inverted Mountain. 

The night was thick, and between heaven and earth, the snowflakes fell like jade, shimmering brighter than silver mercury. 

Wang Shizi curiously asked, “Why would you, a senior, choose to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall at this time but still be willing to actively teach me sword techniques?” 

Zuo withdrew his gaze and laughed, “A wild cultivator of Tongye, Golden Core guest Wang Shizi, alone for fourteen years, has climbed the city walls thrice and been forced to retreat thrice. I, Zuo, consider you a fellow cultivator, so when I speak of sword techniques with you, it’s not just guidance; it’s sparring.” 

Wang Shizi was left speechless, several times wanting to speak but hesitating. 

Zuo said, “Speak freely.” 

Wang Shizi smiled, “I thought it was the second shopkeeper speaking with me.” 

Zuo laughed heartily, “I’m a senior brother of Chen Qingdu; if you think our words and actions are similar, it’s not strange.” 

Wang Shizi said, “Senior, I believe the second shopkeeper will definitely make a name for himself in the Haoran world!” 

Zuo shook his head, “Just wait; the Haoran world will only blame him for not doing enough. All those past grievances will become reasons for criticism. The door-closed disciple of the Wensheng lineage, the younger brother of Zuo, Chen Qingdu, will also be a person worth taking note of. What a new hidden official who has distanced himself from the battlefield—this will all serve as excellent excuses to deny my younger brother. If he dies, it should be expected, so it won't be mentioned. But as long as he doesn’t die at the Sword Qi Great Wall, it will always be a thousand mistakes.” 

Wang Shizi felt heavy-hearted. 

Zuo said, “It’s not surprising; you’ll get used to it.” 

Zuo and Wang Shizi continued to ride their swords eastward, leaving no further words. 

Before leaving the Sword Qi Great Wall, Zuo had shared heartfelt words with Chen Qingdu. 

“Chen Qingdu, are you truly not the least bit disappointed?” 

“Merely comforting a young man who hasn’t completely lost hope. Disappointed? Not disappointed? To say I’m not disappointed would be true; there’s no hope left to lose.” 

At the Inverted Mountain, in the Springfan Pavilion. 

The layout of the main hall at Springfan Pavilion still followed the etiquette of the scholarly families of the Haoran world. 

A large painting of an immortal landscape hung in the main hall, depicting an unknown mountain peak from the Northern Julu Continent, with couplets on either side containing Confucian teachings on self-cultivation and family governance. Above it hung the plaque “Liubei Hall.” 

In front of the wooden wall was a long table, with a four-sword table in front of it and two rows of chairs on either side. 

Between the entrance and the wooden wall, facing each other, were arranged several chairs in orderly fashion. 

When the guests entered, they would find a small world within this space upon sitting down. 

The managers and talkers from the various ferry routes arrived one after another in this hall. 

After Bai Xi from the Water Cave sat down, he exchanged glances with a few old friends, not daring to communicate through heart voice, but a hint of worry was evident in their eyes. 

The arrangement of the chairs in the hall was quite significant. 

The sect’s foundation, the size of the ferry and trade, and the personal reputation of the ferry talkers seemed to have been calculated thoroughly. 

For instance, Bai Xi noticed that the manager of the “Nanjizi” ferry from the Aiai Continent was an inconspicuous Golden Core cultivator who had always traded in medium-sized businesses. During social interactions, he was someone who wouldn’t say much even at the drinking table. Yet, today, his seating arrangement was notably high. Bai Xi, having learned from the ancestor of the Water Cave, knew this person was actually a concealed Yu Pujing talisman cultivator, whose dealings in the cross-continental ferries were simply a facade; instead, he would sneak off to Dragon Valley to conduct transactions using immortal money, exchanging it for opportunities to extract dragon essence with his unique secret techniques, which he would then resell at high prices to the Liu family of Aiai Continent. 

The ancestor told Bai Xi to pay attention to this character; there was no need to make a deliberate connection, just to be mindful of his gaze and words upon meeting. 

Bai Xi could assert that this “Golden Core old cultivator” appeared calm on the surface but was certainly feeling quite uncomfortable underneath. 

Eventually, everyone took their seats. 

Over ten sword immortals who had left the Sword Qi Great Wall sat on the right side, while the seats directly opposite were even more sparse, with each continent’s sword immortal facing a ferry manager. 

Thus, until this moment, the dozens of ferry managers began to reexamine the young man. 

Every guest present had their own business acumen, being old foxes who had long since honed their trading skills. They had all noticed this somewhat out-of-place young man, who had been gazing up at the hanging couplets in the spacious Springfan Pavilion. 

Wu Qiu and Tang Feiqian, two old gods of the fifth realm from the Central Divine Continent, had keenly observed this young man, and after gauging him, they couldn’t help but feel perplexed. They wouldn’t genuinely believe he was merely a lower fifth realm cultivator, calculating in their hearts, unconsciously treating him as a young, well-concealed sword immortal. 

The four-sword table beneath the plaque remained unoccupied, except for a jade token placed on it, positioned closer to the ferry manager from the Haoran world. 

Not only Wu Qiu, but nearly everyone began to speculate that one of the two seats might be occupied by the sword immortal Han Huaizi of the Taihui Sword Sect, followed by a big sword immortal as the finale, perhaps Nalan Shaowei or one of the heads from the Dong, Chen, or Qi families? Otherwise, why would so many sword immortals gather here? 

Unfortunately, it was now exceedingly difficult to obtain information from the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Moreover, no one dared to act rashly or independently. 

Even a friendly sword immortal like Sun Juyuan had long since started to refuse guests and later made his way to the city walls, with all the servants in his residence either following the sword immortal to the city walls or being confined indoors. Once, someone thought this wasn’t necessary; soon after sneaking out, they died. 

Thus, the information circulating about the Inverted Mountain was merely that which the Sword Qi Great Wall felt was unnecessary to conceal. 

Once everyone settled, the opposite sword immortals had already taken their seats. 

Different sword immortals exhibited different temperaments, seating postures, and auras. 

Even Wu Qiu felt a suffocating sensation. 

Unbeknownst to them, they were all facing the array of over ten sword immortals! 

The critical point was that those who were clearly from the Haoran world were now all presenting themselves as sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Except for the Central Divine Continent and Northern Julu Continent, the ferry managers of the other six continents, who had previously been hosted by their own sword immortals, were already feeling quite tense. They never expected that it would be even more excruciating here. 

After all, the dozens of ferry managers from all the continents had seen many storms, but who could personally experience such a situation? 

All the sword immortals had gone mute. 

This kind of atmosphere usually only existed before a sword immortal decided whether to take a life or not. 

There was no need for words when a flying sword could take a head. 

In the hall. 

The owner of Springfan Pavilion, sword immortal Shao Yunyan, sat near the entrance, not speaking. His position ensured he would definitely not be the first to speak tonight. 

Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan showed no signs of speaking either. 

All the sword immortals remained silent. 

Mi Yu, Wei Jin, Sun Juyuan, Gao Kui, Yuan Qingshu, Xie Songhua, Pu He, Song Ping, Xie Zhi, Li Cai, and Shao Yunyan. 

Along with two Nascent Soul sword cultivators, Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan. 

Some older managers, growing more cautious with age, began to perspire. 

Were they perhaps to be wiped out entirely? 

One cautious manager stole a glance at the two empty master positions. 

Another manager surveyed the young man standing by the towering column. 

The young man coincidentally made eye contact with him and smiled slightly. 

The old manager’s smile was forced, his face stiff. 

The young man remained silent until he spoke, his words crashing like a mountain into a lake, creating waves of shock. 

He walked at a measured pace toward the master position, cheerfully saying, “Since everyone is here, let’s start discussing matters.” 

Upon hearing these words, even some of the previously languorous sword immortals began to sit up straight. 

As he reached the master seat on the right side of the four-sword table, Mi Yu was the first to stand. 

Eleven sword immortals, two Nascent Soul sword cultivators, nearly all stood. 

The dozens of managers hurriedly rose in a panic, with some who stood up a moment too late wishing they could slap themselves twice. 

One by one, they were still in a state of confusion, yet they couldn’t ignore the intimidating stance of the sword immortals. 

Once the young man took his seat, all the sword immortals finally settled down. 

The young man extended a finger and lightly tapped the table, causing the jade token to flip over and reveal the ancient seal characters for “Hidden Official.” 

In the hall, one could hear a pin drop. 

All the businesspeople seeking wealth at the Inverted Mountain quickly shifted their gazes from the jade token, holding their breath, focusing their minds, as if facing an enemy. 

The young man, whose identity had finally become clear, smiled and introduced, “Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Chen Ping’an, the newly appointed Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall.” 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 747: Moving Mountains and Draining Seas

The Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall? Isn’t that the legendary girl with the sheep horn braids? It is said that she could shatter the true forms of great monsters across the wilderness with just her bare fists, making her the most combative of all.

How did she become this unfamiliar young man standing before them?

Even if they didn’t want to believe it, they had to now. With so many sword immortals present, there was no way this young man could simply spout nonsense. 

Or rather, even if they refused to believe, they had to pretend to. Otherwise, if they were to lose their heads to the flying swords of the sword immortals from this continent and have their corpses tossed into the Upside-down Mountain, who would bear the grudge? Could they band together in outrage and seek vengeance from the Sword Qi Great Wall? They should remember that those in the same trade are often rivals. Many ferry businesses actually conflicted with one another.

An old steward from the Aiai Continent weighed the situation before standing up, bowing slightly, and saying slowly, “Congratulations to Sword Immortal Chen on your promotion to Hidden Official. I am Dai Minghao, the steward of the ‘Tai Gang’ ferry on Aiai Continent. My cultivation level is hardly worth mentioning; I fear it would dirty the ears of the Hidden Official. I dare to say, tonight's meeting is a great honor for us, as it is a privilege to have the Hidden Official in attendance. When the Hidden Official speaks, how could we dare disobey? There is really no need to trouble so many senior sword immortals to attend. I am dull and blind, and currently unclear about the developments of the war at the Sword Qi Great Wall. I only know that any sword immortal here is a peak powerhouse with immense killing power. If they stay at the Upside-down Mountain for even a moment, they will have to spend much less time drawing their swords—what a pity!”

Wu Qiao raised the corner of his mouth, then let it drop again. 

Dai Hao’s words had both soft and firm tones, setting a good precedent. He was indeed a Golden Core guest on the path of cultivation and a shrewd businessman.

With so many renowned sword immortals present, instead of discussing business with us minor merchants, it would be more fitting for them to head to the Sword Qi Great Wall to slay monsters.

That suited the demeanor and style of the sword immortals better.

Wu Qiao felt he ought to show some gratitude towards the ‘Tai Gang’ ferry, after all, Dai Hao was taking a considerable risk to speak up on behalf of all the ferries across the eight continents. 

If a sword immortal were to suddenly go on a rampage and kill, Wu Qiao would certainly step in to stop it.

Sitting across from the steward of the Aiai ferry was the female sword immortal Xie Songhua, who raised an eyebrow. 

What a surprise! The Aiai Continent she was responsible for had become the first to jump out and disrupt the proceedings as a “seeker of swords”? 

Chen Ping’an had been patiently listening to the old Golden Core’s speech, his gaze fixed on the words hidden within Dai Hao’s speech. He then gestured to Xie Songhua, indicating that it was not a big deal, just a minor matter.

Chen Ping’an nodded to the old Golden Core steward, smiling as he said, “First of all, I am not a sword immortal. Whether I am a sword cultivator is open to interpretation. If you are interested, you can take a guess. I have taken many cross-continent ferries, and I know that for long journeys, if there isn’t something to alleviate the tedium, it can be quite unbearable. Secondly, among those truly qualified sword immortals present, like the sword immortal Xie sitting opposite you, when to draw their swords and when to retract them is not something outsiders can advise on. It is a good thing that good-hearted people are willing to speak sincerely. Dai Hao, you have set a good example. Moving forward, as we discuss matters, we should be candid and straightforward.”

This made many ferry stewards, who initially thought the young man would be humiliated and lose his temper, feel somewhat disappointed.

Chen Ping’an paused lightly, tapping the table gently, his smile unwavering. “But ultimately, it’s about being able to manage what cannot be managed. Don’t say it’s me; even our senior sword immortal doesn’t constrain himself. Why? It’s simple: sword immortals are ultimately sword immortals; both body and mind are free to draw their swords. Otherwise, how could one be the leader of the four difficult spirits of the mountains, if not for never caring much about matters of divine money, sage principles, or sect rules?”

The steward of the “Wapan” ferry from the Fuyang Continent, Bai Xi, sat opposite the sword immortal Xie Zhi, who had a wild cultivation background.

The steward of the Jin Jia Continent’s ferry was opposite the woman sword immortal Song Ping, who had earlier poured a drink before serving punishment alcohol.

Across from them on the Liuxia Continent was the sword immortal Pu He, who had once tossed a Yuan Ying ferry steward out of the Spring Banner Pavilion like a chick and had said he wanted to gather a few friends and reminisce with Li Xun at the Ancestor Hall.

The ferry stewards of these three continents were particularly moved by the new Hidden Official’s words.

Chen Ping’an maintained a friendly demeanor, as if he were chatting with acquaintances. “Dai Hao, I appreciate your good intentions, but if someone from another continent were to say these words, it would be more appropriate. Coming from you, it feels a bit out of place. The sword immortal Xie has drawn her sword twice: once obliterating the foundation of a Jade Purity realm monster sword cultivator, and another time completely destroying an ordinary Jade Purity realm monster, leaving nothing behind. As for the Yuan Ying and Golden Core monsters, naturally, they would have been eliminated as well. Therefore, the sword immortal Xie has achieved a complete merit and will not return to the Sword Qi Great Wall; instead, she will leave the Upside-down Mountain with you to return home to Aiai Continent. Regarding this matter, did the sword immortal Xie not mention it earlier while busy reminiscing with her fellow townsfolk?”

Chen Ping’an turned to look at Xie Songhua.

Xie Songhua stared at Dai Hao intently and said, “I’ve mentioned it. I reckon that Old Daoist Dai has forgotten.”

Chen Ping’an waved his hand, casting a glance at the heavy snow falling outside the Spring Banner Pavilion, and said, “No worries, let’s just consider it as mentioning it again. It’s a rare thing to encounter fellow townsfolk in a strange land, so it’s worth reminding once more.”

Dai Hao stood up, clearly not daring to sit back down, as he likely would feel like he was sitting on needles if he did. 

“Why are you standing? Everyone is seated, and standing alone might seem as if you are looking down on the sword immortals,” Chen Ping’an said, his smile fading as he addressed the old Golden Core. “Sit.”

Dai Hao immediately sat back down. 

Wu Qiao and the neighboring Tang Feiqian, both from the Middle Earth’s Jade Purity realm, exchanged quick glances. 

It seemed this new Hidden Official was not very sword immortal-like.

The concealed Jade Purity cultivator from Aiai Continent’s “Nanji” ferry, Jiang Gaotai, was quite elderly yet maintained a youthful appearance. His seat was very close to the front, adjacent to Tang Feiqian. He had some connections with Dai Hao from the “Tai Gang” ferry, and since he’d been directly exposed by the Sword Qi Great Wall, he was worried that the business of the Jiao Long Ditch would be disrupted in the future.

This prompted Jiang Gaotai to speak up, both for public and private reasons, as it was only natural to say a few words. Otherwise, would a whole continent like Aiai truly allow Xie Songhua, a woman, to grip their throats?

Without even standing, Jiang Gaotai directly spoke, “Hidden Official, we are of no worth in terms of cultivation level. If it comes to the skills of killing, perhaps all of us added together, with a couple of sword immortals joining forces, would wipe out all the guests in this Spring Banner Pavilion.”

Xie Songhua narrowed her eyes, raising one palm and lightly stroking the armrest of her chair.

Jiang Gaotai ignored this and continued, “We, who are full of copper smell, are good only at engaging in minor businesses to earn a meager living. If the Hidden Official thinks it’s worth discussing, then let’s talk properly. If not, we will endure any unsuitable business to survive. I can’t concern myself with how others from different continents think. I, Jiang Gaotai, have a tattered ‘Nanji’ ferry and will take the lead. Hidden Official, just set the price. Even if it’s a loss-making business, I will still engage, celebrating the fact that Sword Immortal Chen has been promoted to Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Wu Qiao, Bai Xi, and others all looked at Jiang Gaotai with newfound respect. 

He was clear and decisive. 

Wu Qiao’s only worry, for now, was not the young Hidden Official with a smile masked by a blade, but rather the internal conflicts among “their own,” such as the longstanding grudges with Beiju Lu Continent and Aiai Continent. 

Earlier, Shao Yunyan of the Spring Banner Pavilion personally arranged for the ferry stewards of one continent to gather in a courtyard and host guests with the sword immortals from their own continent, which could be said to be quite scheming. 

The animosity between Beiju Lu Continent and Aiai Continent was well-known. 

Thus, an old Yuan Ying sword cultivator steward from Beiju Lu Continent wanted to immediately tear down Jiang Gaotai’s “high ground.” Even if he hadn’t shared a drink with the leader of the Floating Weeds Sword Lake, just because a little brat from Aiai Continent was showing off, Beiju Lu Continent would be inclined to retaliate. The order of speaking from the two ferry stewards of Aiai Continent had made them think that Beiju Lu Continent was dead?! 

In the world of Haoran, Beiju Lu Continent was the only one with cross-continent ferries heading to the Upside-down Mountain, and they made the least profit!

However, all ferry stewards, including the old sword cultivator within, had received the message from Li Cai, “Don’t pay attention to this guy; tonight’s meeting is just for show.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “It’s proper etiquette to stand and speak in Haoran.”

Upon hearing this, most of the ferry stewards opposite the sword immortals changed their expressions. 

Let Dai Hao sit down and then let Jiang Gaotai stand up? 

Didn’t the logic already belong to Chen Ping’an alone? 

Jiang Gaotai’s expression darkened. He had generally had a smooth life, with continuous opportunities. Even when dealing with bigshots from the Liu family of Aiai Continent, he had never faced such an insult, only receiving respect.

Chen Ping’an clasped his hands into his sleeves and watched Jiang Gaotai with a smile.

Dai Hao had stated that he did not wish to waste the sword immortals’ time slaying monsters, and the young Hidden Official had said quite a bit of unrelated things. The truly weighty words were that Xie Sword Immortal had shattered the Yuan Ying Golden Core of a Jade Purity realm monster. The Golden Core in question was Dai Hao’s old Golden Core? 

Jiang Gaotai’s retreat was a forward move, clearly denying the sword immortals the chance to take action while also testing the bottom line of the Sword Qi Great Wall. In the end, the young Hidden Official spoke about the proper etiquette of Haoran? 

Many old stewards felt extremely uncomfortable, as these matters were not the way they were best at discussing.

Jiang Gaotai smiled and stood up, cupping his fists. “It was my lack of etiquette, and I apologize to the Hidden Official.”

Wu Qiao, Tang Feiqian, Bai Xi, and others secretly breathed a sigh of relief. 

They truly feared Jiang Gaotai might give that young man the chance to demonstrate his authority. 

Unexpectedly, that young man smiled again, “Accepting the apology means you can sit down and talk.”

The dignified Jade Purity realm cultivator, Jiang Gaotai, stood there with a dark expression. 

If he were to engage in a business duel with the young Hidden Official, no matter how difficult it would be to endure privately, Jiang Gaotai was a businessman and wouldn’t be so embarrassed. What really worried Jiang Gaotai was losing face tonight at the Spring Banner Pavilion, only to be flayed and trampled afterward, which would affect many of his private trades with the Liu family of Aiai Continent.

Jiang Gaotai pretended to be unwilling to be used as a pawn and was about to leave in a huff.

Xie Songhua said, “Hidden Official, I will take the ‘Nanji’ ferry back home now, no need to see me off.”

Unexpectedly, Shao Yunyan was even more resolute. He stood by the door and said, “The Sword Qi Great Wall and the Nanji ferry, even if the business doesn’t work out, we still have our righteousness. I believe the Hidden Official won’t obstruct it. As an outsider, I shouldn’t concern myself with these matters. It just so happens that I, Shao Yunyan, am the owner of the Spring Banner Pavilion, so before Sword Immortal Xie leaves, allow me to accompany Jiang shipmaster for a stroll through the Spring Banner Pavilion.”

Shao Yunyan didn’t want Xie Songhua to act too extreme, fearing it would affect her future path to greatness. He was alone, so he didn’t care.

Jiang Gaotai stopped in his tracks, laughing heartily, and turned to look at the young man with a smile. “Hidden Official, do you think we are fools? Does the Sword Qi Great Wall really welcome customers and do business like this? I want to see after half a year of this coercive buying and selling, how many ferries will still be docked at the Upside-down Mountain?!”

Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “Shipmaster Jiang is a very clever person; otherwise, how could you have reached the Jade Purity realm? You must know proper etiquette. You probably never wanted to do business with us from the start. No matter, I’ll let Jiang shipmaster leave, and let Master Shao accompany you to enjoy the scenery. So as to avoid any misunderstandings, I want to mention something here: Sword Immortal Shao has no relations with us, and tonight’s meeting is held at the Spring Banner Pavilion, which I paid for on behalf of the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Shao Yunyan smiled and said, “With the arrival of sword immortals, such a small place as the Spring Banner Pavilion is honored, so there is still a discount.”

Chen Ping’an sighed, displaying a somewhat mournful expression as he spoke to Jiang Gaotai, “That big hat of coercive buying and selling, I can’t bear it. If the Sword Qi Great Wall cannot do business with the Nanji ferry, even if it pains me to death, I can only blame my own lack of ability. It’s just a pity I didn’t even get the chance to make an offer. Shipmaster Jiang didn’t even want to hear my price. It really goes to show the old saying—when one is insignificant, their words hold little weight. I would rather be tactful. Let everyone enjoy a good laugh.”

Chen Ping’an stood up, looking at Jiang Gaotai, who still hadn’t moved. “I won’t hold it against you for being impatient, and you shouldn’t misunderstand my sincerity. Instead, don’t throw mud at me; gentlemen end their friendships without harsh words. In the end, let’s settle for a courteous parting.”

Then Chen Ping’an no longer looked at Jiang Gaotai and shifted his gaze to Wu Qiao, Tang Feiqian, and Bai Xi, saying, “The Sword Qi Great Wall treats guests with great sincerity. Dai Hao has spoken, and Jiang shipmaster has also spoken. Next, there’s one more person who can say something before the Sword Qi Great Wall. After that, I’ll come back to discuss business. The principle is always the same: from today onward, if I allow you ferry operators to earn less than before, this kind of business—let’s not talk about doing it, even if I wanted to, I wouldn’t.”

At this point, Chen Ping’an turned his attention to the sword immortals, “Sword Immortal Xie, wouldn’t you accompany Jiang shipmaster to send him off?”

Xie Songhua stood up and looked at the young Hidden Official who had personally helped her accumulate two feats. This woman, who was most reluctant to owe favors, surprisingly showed a hint of guilt.

Chen Ping’an gently shook his head.

Xie Songhua broke into a smile, no longer wanting to be coy, and turned to Jiang Gaotai, saying, “Once I step outside this door, I’ll just be Aiai Continent sword cultivator Xie Songhua. Shipmaster Jiang, let me and Master Shao, two sword cultivators of your level, accompany you to stroll through the Spring Banner Pavilion?”

Jiang Gaotai’s mind raced as he asked, “Hidden Official, are you truly not going to let us lose money? Is that real?”

Chen Ping’an walked around the four-sword table, pressed his hand against the jade plaque with the ancient inscription “Hidden Official,” and faced both sides, smiling without saying a word.

Shao Yunyan had already walked towards the door.

Xie Songhua had already exuded a hint of sword intent, and the bamboo sword box behind her trembled.

Tang Feiqian stood up, slightly turning to the young man, cupping his fists and saying, “I sincerely request Hidden Official to keep Jiang shipmaster; parting unhappily is ultimately not pleasant. If Hidden Official is willing to allow the Nanji ferry to exert a small effort, wouldn’t that be even better?”

Tang Feiqian was not helping Jiang Gaotai to save his life; he was, in fact, helping himself and everyone present who was nervously doing business with the Sword Qi Great Wall tonight. 

All the resentment had to be hidden for now. 

Once they left the Spring Banner Pavilion, far from the Upside-down Mountain, everything would be negotiable.

Chen Ping’an asked, “The scenery on the mountains of Haoran is winding and familiar to you, and I am no stranger. Not discussing business, but Shipmaster Jiang, what do you think will happen when you step out the door? Do you think you, Jiang shipmaster, know what’s at stake? Why should you stay? As the third person to speak with me, please express your thoughts well; I will endure for a moment and listen.”

Chen Ping’an lightly tapped the jade plaque with his fingers, smiling as he said, “In this hall, discussing business has its own rules, and those rules will always outweigh my status as Hidden Official. In the end, it’s all business dealings, and grievances can be resolved over divine money. Once you spend some time with me, you will naturally understand that I am one of the fairest businessmen of the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Sword Immortal Xie Zhi smiled and said, “That’s true.”

Chen Ping’an immediately added, “Helping one’s own people speak will only hinder them.”

Xie Zhi glanced at the ferry stewards from Fuyang Continent. “Hidden Official, you are right, but I, Xie Zhi, am from Fuyang Continent, and the people here are my wealthy relatives.”

Wei Jin from the Wind and Snow Temple, sitting with a blank expression, closed his eyes to meditate, feeling somewhat helpless at this point. 

The words from the wild cultivator sword immortal Xie Zhi didn’t seem like something Chen Ping’an had taught him beforehand. It seemed like genuine words spoken in the heat of the moment.

Tang Feiqian pondered a moment before cautiously saying, “As long as the Hidden Official is willing to keep Jiang shipmaster for discussions, I am willing to make an exception to take action and offer a 10% discount on the next ferry docking at the Upside-down Mountain.”

Chen Ping’an took the jade plaque and hung it at his waist before returning to his seat, saying, “Why should I allow a foolish Jade Purity realm person with money to continue sitting here and make things difficult for themselves? Do you think my title of Hidden Official is worth less than a ‘Nanji’ ferry that only steals a bit of dragon energy in the Jiao Long Ditch? Ten percent? The Liu family of Aiai Continent sells the dragon energy to your Tang Feiqian’s backers, which is only worth a ten percent profit? You already look down on me; do you also look down on Jiang Gaotai’s fundamental survival?!”

Tang Feiqian frowned. 

How did the Sword Qi Great Wall know about such private matters? 

Chen Ping’an said solemnly, “The Sword Immortal of Ku Xia.”

“Here,” the Ku Xia sword immortal prepared to stand.

If Xie Songhua owed Chen Ping’an a big favor, then the Ku Xia sword immortal’s association with the Shao Yuan Dynasty was a debt greater than a huge favor. 

As the future pillar of the Shao Yuan Dynasty, Lin Junbi had a bright path ahead!

The Ku Xia sword immortal was straightforward—repay one favor for another, simple as that. 

If he couldn’t return it, since he was the disciple of Zhou Shen Zhi, he could always let Lin Junbi take a few messages back to the Central Earth Divine Continent after returning.

As for whether his master, Zhou Shen Zhi, would listen to his nephew’s final words, whether to take action or not, the Ku Xia sword immortal didn’t want to think too much about it.

Bai Xi knew that as long as the sword immortals present were the most agreeable, if this person began to threaten, it would be severe trouble for their side.

Thus, even if Bai Xi had to steel himself, he needed to stop the Ku Xia sword immortal as the steward of the Wapan ferry from the Mountain and Water Cave, and he would speak first! 

Bai Xi had seen through the situation; dealing with this young Hidden Official, who was more righteous than Haoran, couldn’t involve any tricks.

Bai Xi stood up with a calm expression and said, “If Hidden Official insists Jiang shipmaster leaves, then let it be one for me, Bai Xi of the Mountain and Water Cave.”

Bai Xi even smiled, not hiding his sarcastic intent. “I only hope that Sword Immortal Xie and Sword Immortal Shao wouldn’t think that my cultivation is too lowly and thus unworthy to accompany you.”

Xie Songhua simply responded with an “oh,” and casually said, “Not worthy is not worthy, but that’s fine. I have plenty of sword intent in my bamboo sword box.”

Shao Yunyan stood by the door.

The wild cultivator sword immortal Xie Zhi turned to look at the young Hidden Official. 

Chen Ping’an smiled and gestured for him to remain seated, indicating that there was no need to get up and speak.

With Bai Xi unexpectedly willing to break the deadlock with his own life, they wouldn’t be led around by the nose by the Sword Qi Great Wall any longer. Soon, there were other cultivators from the same continent familiar with Bai Xi who also stood up, “Count me in.”

Even the Yuan Ying ferry steward who had been tossed out of the Spring Banner Pavilion by Pu He earlier, despite having earlier been treated like a dog by the sword immortals, resolutely stood up and said, “I, Liu Yu, shipmaster of the ‘Fuzhong’ ferry, would also like to enjoy the sights of the Spring Banner Pavilion, along with experiencing the sword intent of Sword Immortal Xie.”

Not only that, but there was also an unnamed young Golden Core female ferry steward, who had a special identity as a fairy from the Southwest Sea of Haoran. Her seat was quite far back, yet she stood up and said, “I, Liu Shen, shipmaster of the ‘Ni Chang’ ferry, wonder if there is a chance to join Sword Immortal Xie and Sword Immortal Shao on a tour of the Spring Banner Pavilion.”

The lowest cultivation level was still that of a female cultivator.

This method of death had its significance.

The last to stand was the Yuan Ying female cultivator who had earlier conversed with Mi Yu. She slowly rose, smiling at Mi Yu, “Sword Immortal Mi, it’s an honor to meet you again. I wonder if your sword technique has improved after many years.”

Mi Yu smiled and said, “I can’t bear to.” 

The Yuan Ying female cultivator sneered.

Wu Qiao, who had been motionless, felt immensely satisfied. 

This is how the ferry operators from various continents should conduct business with the Sword Qi Great Wall, showcasing their “small world.” 

Aren’t sword immortals most fond of and skilled at killing? 

Now there were people, and not just one, stretching their necks to see if they would truly be killed. 

Would they draw their swords or not? 

Jiang Gaotai cupped his fists and said, “Thank you, everyone!”

Tang Feiqian, who had stood up and hadn’t sat down, shared a similar feeling as his friend Wu Qiao. 

Did this young Hidden Official really think that calling a large group of sword immortals to pressure them, relying solely on a piece of jade plaque, meant everything was under his control? 

What an ignorant brat! 

At such a young age, what was he even worth! 

Li Cai extended a finger, rubbing her mouth corner, wanting to slay one with a sword to put an end to the matter. 

However, the voice of the young Hidden Official echoed in her heart, urging her to remain calm. 

Only then did she manage to refrain from drawing her sword. 

Wei Jin had opened his eyes. 

The two old Dragon City ferry stewards who had been about to take action immediately became obedient. 

The ferry masters from the Southern Powsa Continent remained relatively quiet. 

As for those from Beiju Lu Continent, they had no intention of getting involved at all. 

At this moment, after the fervor of sentiments had passed, everyone gradually noticed that the young man, who should have been in a precarious situation, had actually propped his head on one hand, leaning back against the four-sword table, smiling as he watched everyone. 

Beiju Lu Continent, Baoping Continent, Southern Powsa Continent—all negotiable. 

One was due to ancient customs, one was too difficult to communicate with, and one was too close to the Upside-down Mountain, especially with that erudite Chen clan, and Chen Chun'an had only just left the Sword Qi Great Wall not long ago. 

The Central Earth Divine Continent, Aiai Continent, and Fuyang Continent were the hardest to negotiate with. 

One was used to pointing fingers and looking down on the heroes of the eight continents. One believed that divine money was more important than anything. One was the one most experienced in the business of the Upside-down Mountain and also the most capable of making money. 

Whether Jin Jia Continent and Liuxia Continent were negotiable or not depended on the situation. 

Currently, it had become a situation that was not very negotiable. 

Chen Ping’an’s gaze finally lingered on the two old Dragon City ferry stewards for a while longer. 

The cross-continent ferries from Baoping Continent were essentially just the six ferries from Dragon City, the Fu family’s Treasure Swallowing Whale, and that floating island known as the “Little Upside-down.” The Sun family had a mountain sea turtle that had been captured and tamed by their ancestors, and the Fan family also had that Osmanthus Island. 

The two stewards visiting the Spring Banner Pavilion tonight were one from the Fu family’s Treasure Swallowing Whale and one from Ding family’s cross-continent ferry. 

Having been to Dragon City several times, he had never met either of them, and it was likely that even if these two big shots from Dragon City had heard of “Chen Ping’an,” they would just think it was a common name. 

The young Hidden Official lazily smiled and said, “What’s the deal? A good mutually beneficial business transaction has to be placed on the table like this, weighing it by the pound? I don’t think it’s necessary.”

Tang Feiqian coldly laughed, “Just now, you were shouting for blood, trying to use the sword immortals’ might to dictate life and death, as if we were the ones doing it.”

Chen Ping’an maintained his posture, smiling as he said, “Am I not young and brash, with a little power going to my head, getting a bit carried away?” 

Wu Qiao took a sip of tea from the Spring Banner Pavilion and gently set the cup down, smiling, “We people have not achieved much in our lives, and we are worlds apart from the Hidden Official. We are not from the same path, so we are unable to converse on the same wavelength. It is indeed difficult to make a living, and each of us puts our lives on the line. Why don’t we change the location and time to talk again? Still, that saying holds true: a Hidden Official’s words carry weight. There’s no need to trouble the sword immortals; perhaps it would suffice to have the head of the Yan family or Sword Immortal Nalan deal with us little people.”

Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “I mentioned before, there are rules for stepping out, and there are rules for sitting here. For example, everything can be resolved over divine money. Earlier, there was quite a commotion, and you didn’t think it through. So I want to clarify: I came to the Upside-down Mountain to change a large number of ferry masters, for example…”

Chen Ping’an looked at the young Golden Core female cultivator sitting at the back, “‘Ni Chang’ shipmaster Liu Shen, I am willing to offer two hundred Gu Yu coins or equivalent goods from the pill workshop to have your junior sister take over ‘Ni Chang.’ The price may not be fair, but if a person is dead, what can be done? After all, the ferry can still earn two hundred Gu Yu coins. Why did I pick you first? It’s simple: you’re a soft persimmon, and when it comes to killing, your mountain peak and master won’t even dare to let out a whimper.”

The Golden Core female cultivator’s face instantly turned pale. 

Jiang Gaotai immediately asked with a smile, “I wonder how much my head is worth in the eyes of the Hidden Official?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head and said, “You are a sure death, no need to pay me a single divine coin. The Liu family from Aiai Continent will handle the mess. As for the Central Earth Divine Continent, the Ku Xia sword immortal will also speak to his master Zhou Shen Zhi to settle things with Tang Feiqian and his backing. Everyone is in business, and it should be clear that levels of cultivation aren’t that important.”

Chen Ping’an said, “Sword Immortal Xie, don’t go out just yet. If Jiang shipmaster says another word, just kill him. This way, they won’t think I, the Hidden Official, wouldn’t dare to use a heavy hand.”

Xie Songhua exhaled heavily. 

Finally, she could draw her sword and kill someone. 

Chen Ping’an turned to Bai Xi, the Yuan Ying from the Mountain and Water Cave, and said, “Your ancestor has old grudges with our Sword Qi Great Wall, and the hatreds run deep. The previous Hidden Officials ignored you, but I’m here now. Tonight, don’t leave. I’ll have Sword Immortal Xie make an extra trip to protect your Wapan ferry, ensuring a smooth return to the Fuyang Continent’s Mountain and Water Cave, and clarify with your ancestor that all grievances will be settled. After that, business will continue as usual; whether you come or not will be up to you, and the consequences will be yours to bear.”

This time, it was the sword immortals who began to stand up. 

The wild cultivator sword immortal Xie Zhi stood up, smiling and reminiscing, “It has been many years since I’ve killed a bureaucratic immortal; how nostalgic.”

Chen Ping’an continued, “As long as you haven’t stood up to leave, everyone here is a distinguished guest of the Sword Qi Great Wall.” 

Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “Without bringing all the details and some of the petty grievances to the surface, letting the ferry owners and the Sword Qi Great Wall see each other clearly, how can we build long-term trust for business?”

Chen Ping’an said, “Mi Yu.”

Mi Yu stood up, his expression cold, looking at the female Yuan Ying cultivator, “I’m sorry; this last time was my final deception. I can actually afford it.” 

The Yuan Ying female cultivator’s heart felt like it was being sliced apart. 

Then Mi Yu pulled out a booklet from his sleeve, glancing around, casually picking a steward who hadn’t yet stood up but had almost done so earlier, revealing the family lineage of that person. 

Not just their origins and which disciple of theirs was favored, but also how their descendants branched out at the foot of the mountain and where their various private residences were located—not only their private properties at the Upside-down Mountain but also their residences across the continent, even noting those like Wu Qiao and Tang Feiqian who had foundations in other continents, all meticulously recorded. 

Mi Yu spoke freely about the details of those relationships and connections, including with which fairies they were not spiritual partners yet had connections that were even closer than that. 

After mentioning two ferry stewards’ backgrounds as if he were counting his treasures, Chen Ping’an said, “That’s enough; no need to go on.” 

Mi Yu nodded. 

Now that he had been appointed by the Hidden Official as the leader of the Hidden Officials, it wasn’t for nothing, was it? 

Chen Ping’an called out another name, “Pu He.” 

Pu He stood up, staring at the Yuan Ying cultivator who had previously apologized to him, his eyes dark. “I just can’t understand. How can there be such a trader in the world who almost died and wants to die again? I want to see if that Jade Purity realm Ling Ran will kneel on the ground and beg me for a favor once I board the ship.” 

Chen Ping’an looked at the key figures from the two ferry stewards from the eight continents, “Wu Qiao, Tang Feiqian. You two old immortals have even purchased houses at the Beiju Lu Continent’s Dili Mountain, yet you still call yourselves small fries in front of me.” 

Li Cai stood up. “I won’t leave the Upside-down Mountain, but I can send a flying sword message to the Floating Weeds Sword Sect and Taohui Sword Sect, saying that there are some rumors from the Upside-down Mountain suggesting that the two old immortals are colluding with the monsters. By the way, Ku Xia Sword Immortal, aren’t Yu Jianfu and Zhu Mei’s juniors still at the Sword Qi Great Wall? Let them also talk about this matter with the Central Earth Divine Continent so that the two old immortals can clear their names and avoid wronging the good people.”

The Ku Xia sword immortal immediately stood up and said, “No problem. That’s how it should be.” 

Chen Ping’an blinked, filled with confusion, “Do you think I want to become enemies with the mountain behind you? Is it necessary? Not at all; I just don’t like you. Besides a few who are surely doomed, I still have a sense of proportion when I do things. Furthermore, post-event apologies, along with generous compensation, will be provided. In the long run, no one will lose out. Do you really think that I called the sword immortals here just to drink tea with you? Do you think you’re worthy of that?” 

Sun Juyuan also stood up, smiling, “I have some ties with all of you and the sects and ancestors behind you, but there are no personal grievances at all. Therefore, I won’t trouble the Hidden Official with apologies; I can handle that myself.” 

Yan Ming stood up. “As for compensation, my Yan family still has some resources. I, Yan Ming, will handle it until it’s settled.” 

Nalan Caihuan did not move. 

Tonight’s events had exceeded her expectations by far. 

Chen Ping’an shifted his gaze, “Don’t let outsiders see the joke. My face doesn’t matter, but the face of Nalan Shaowei is worth something.” 

Nalan Caihuan had no choice but to slowly stand up. 

Chen Ping’an completely lost his smile, though he still maintained a relaxed posture, his gaze firmly fixed on the business-savvy Yuan Ying sword cultivator. 

Nalan Caihuan steeled herself, remaining silent. 

Chen Ping’an asked, “Is there a mix-up with your seating arrangement? You, Nalan Caihuan, should sit over there.” 

Nalan Caihuan’s eyes flashed with anger, about to speak. 

Sword Immortal Gao Kui stood up, turning to look at Nalan Caihuan. 

Nalan Caihuan had originally been about to call out “Chen Ping’an” but swallowed each word back down one by one. 

This sudden change was increasingly shocking to Wu Qiao and the other “outsiders.” 

This young Hidden Official, who spoke of being small-minded and gaining power, was truly ruthless enough to even kill his own people! 

Whether he was small-minded or not was hard to say. 

This young man’s heart was extremely dark! 

As for that phrase about holding great authority, there was no hint of exaggeration. 

Wu Qiao finally stood up, cupping his fists and saying, “Hidden Official, there’s no need for this. Business is just business; let’s both take a step back and seek a mutually beneficial outcome, aiming for a steady stream of wealth.”

The young Hidden Official merely rested his hand on his chin, gazing out at the heavy snow outside the door. 

Chen Ping’an seemed to be talking to himself, “Do you really believe that the Sword Qi Great Wall has no good relations or ties in the Haoran world? Do you think the Sword Qi Great Wall can exist without these? It’s just that we don’t behave like you, engaging in deceitful dealings, and that became your reason to mistakenly think that sword immortals are brainless. Do you know why you’re still standing here, alive, and not dead?” 

Chen Ping’an posed the question to himself, “That’s because over the nearly ten thousand long years, since the first cross-continent ferry arrived at the Upside-down Mountain, from that ferry called ‘Zhen Shui,’ if I remember correctly, the second ferry was from Fuyang Continent’s now-defunct sect, Yun Duy Mountain, called ‘Fu Yang,’ and the third was from the now-nonexistent Tong Ye Continent with the ‘Tong San’ ferry that capsized in a maritime disaster, killing everyone aboard. When the news reached the Sword Qi Great Wall, the sword immortals could only silently draw their swords to pay homage. This matter is far too distant, and many of the local sword immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall may not be aware of it.”

Chen Ping’an straightened his posture.

“In those early years, almost all ferries heading to the Upside-down Mountain were not for profit but were essentially giving money to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Even though circumstances have changed over time, we at the Sword Qi Great Wall have always remembered your ferries across the eight continents and never forgot. Do you now understand why Nalan Shaowei was so furious but still didn’t draw his sword when he reached the Rain Dragon Sect’s territory? Now you know the reason, right? It wasn’t because that old ancestor from the Mountain and Water Cave was particularly clever, nor was it because he was adept at forming alliances; with a single sword strike, he could wipe them out without a trace.”

“You all are here to earn money, but in the end, the materials from each ferry are continuously sent to the Upside-down Mountain and then transferred to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Without you, the Sword Qi Great Wall would have long been unable to hold its ground, and we acknowledge that.”

Chen Ping’an stood up suddenly, laughing, and stretched out his hands, pressing them down several times, “Everyone sit; what are you all standing around for? When I say I’ll kill, I truly mean it! Is there any point in having a conversation? Do you really believe it?” 

The young Hidden Official smiled cheerfully, “Jiang shipmaster, sit. Liu Shen, you sit too. Everyone, let’s sit and talk. Harmony brings wealth; we are all merchants, not suited for fighting and killing.” 

Mi Yu remained standing. 

Thus, no one dared to sit down. 

Xie Songhua, Pu He, and Xie Zhi, among others from the Haoran world, still had evident killing intent. 

Chen Ping’an walked to Nalan Caihuan’s chair, reached out with two fingers, and gently pressed down on the shoulder of the young female Yuan Ying sword cultivator, smiling as he reminded her, “You should take the lead and sit down, or else you’ll die. There are many overly adventurous businesses in your hands, and the records of the Hidden Official lineage are all meticulously noted. So you are still too foolish; do you really think your ancestor’s business acumen surpasses yours? You are tens of thousands of miles apart from the old sword immortal. Nalan Shaowei has already saved your life once; he can’t do it a second time.”

Nalan Caihuan felt struck by lightning; her mind blanked, and her face lost color as she slowly sat down. 

Then the young Hidden Official rested his arms on the high back of Nalan Caihuan’s chair, looking at the ferry stewards across from him, his expression filled with helplessness, “I’ve treated you with respect, pressured you with force, enlightened you with reason, and moved you with emotion. As a small Hidden Official, I have done everything I could tonight, so why is it that no one is willing to give me a bit of face? Hmm?!”

Thus, everyone sat down. 

This young Hidden Official, who had sprung up from nowhere, was devious and ruthless, his mind twisted! 

Chen Ping’an returned to his original position but did not sit down, slowly saying, “I cannot guarantee that you will earn more money than before, but I can guarantee that you will earn a lot of money. This can be trusted. If you don’t believe it, it doesn’t matter; in the future, those increasingly thick account books on your desks won’t lie.” 

Mi Yu stood up, shaking his sleeves, producing volumes of books that hovered in front of each ferry steward. 

Chen Ping’an continued, “All the materials needed by the Sword Qi Great Wall will be on the list, sorted and priced according to Tian Gan. The specifics for discounts will depend on how capable you are at digging into the earth in the Haoran world. For those ferry stewards who couldn’t attend tonight’s meeting, please help spread the word. Many materials that were previously accepted will not be received at all in the future, but certain materials will be welcomed at the Sword Qi Great Wall at even higher prices. Each continent has its strengths.”

“Promising credit to the Sword Qi Great Wall while refusing us credit is a matter of friendship and connections, while the latter is the duty of a businessman to pursue wealth. You can always discuss this with me privately; whether it’s extending credit in exchange for benefits elsewhere, that can also be negotiated.”

All the ferry stewards began to carefully browse through the volumes. 

At this point, Chen Ping’an smiled at Bai Xi, the Yuan Ying cultivator from the Mountain and Water Cave, “Isn’t it surprising? One of your schemes was apparently to unload and reload before arriving at the Upside-down Mountain, aiming for a ferry that specializes in a few types of materials to seek a high price, avoiding mutual price pressure and selling cheaply to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Isn’t it just what the Sword Qi Great Wall is already helping you accomplish? Old Immortal Bai Xi, ask yourself, hasn’t the Sword Qi Great Wall always been straightforward in dealings with you? Why do you still act secretly without gaining anything? What’s the point? As for who leaked your intentions, there’s no need to investigate. With Fuyang Continent’s rich resources and the capabilities of the Mountain and Water Cave, you’ll be too busy making money in the future to bother with such trivial matters.”

The Aiai Continent cultivators, upon reaching a certain point, were stunned for a moment; the Sword Qi Great Wall was actually going to buy large amounts of snowflake coins in the future?! 

The steward from Dragon City’s Fu family, upon turning to a page, also found it interesting because the price of Yungenshi, a specialty from Yunxia Mountain, which had already been contracted with the Fu family, would go up! 

Even the ferry stewards from Beiju Lu Continent, who were least inclined to earn big money, were left speechless, realizing they would have to sit down and have a good discussion with the Skeleton Marsh’s Pi Ma Sect upon their return to their continent. 

Finally, Chen Ping’an said, “The next batch of money will be yours to earn freely. If anyone decides to stop their cross-continent ferry here and refuses to make this divine money, acting like a child throwing a tantrum and engaging in a conflict of wills, that’s fine; the rivers will remain green and the waters will flow, and this friendship will slowly be calculated. Moreover, aside from public matters, you ferry stewards should also think about your paths. For those who wish to acquire pill workshop items or certain fairy treasures, we at the Sword Qi Great Wall will record them one by one. As long as it’s feasible, we’ll help you exchange goods. If you need to supplement some divine coins, we will, of course, be straightforward with you. During this period, I guarantee that the Sword Qi Great Wall will not earn an extra snowflake coin from anyone. Consider it a small benefit I’m extending to all of you.” 

Jiang Gaotai discreetly flipped through the thick volume, asking via thought, “Hidden Official, are you truly not killing anyone and just doing business?”

Chen Ping’an smiled and said, “It all depends on the result, not the process. Shouldn’t I be thanking you? The day we no longer do business, we will settle the accounts then. But you can rest assured; for every completed business deal, the prices will stay there. Not only is it mutual consent, but it also counts as a bit of your goodwill, so there’s hope for reconciliation. Beyond that, the world is vast. Whether we meet again in this lifetime is uncertain.”

Jiang Gaotai was skeptical. 

Chen Ping’an either replied to some quiet inquiries from others or initiated conversations with them. 

“Your young city lord Fu Nanhua, what realm is he currently at?” 

“Lady Liu, I spoke hastily earlier. Your left and right arms, your junior sister, truly holds great respect for you.” 

“Don’t hold a grudge against our sword immortal Mi Yu; how could he bear to kill you? Of course, it was just for show for this Hidden Official. If you’re hurt by this, it will only cause him more pain. Unrequited love is a great regret in the world.” 

The young Hidden Official, who was still filled with youthful vigor, spoke casually, as if exchanging pleasantries with acquaintances. 

However, those words fell into the hearts of each ferry steward, making them chew on every word carefully, fearing they might miss some hidden meaning. 

Because even though no one had communicated directly, they all shared the same trepidation regarding one thing. 

This young man, at some earlier moment, had genuinely wanted to kill everyone present in the hall opposite the sword immortals. 

It might indeed be true, or it could be false. 

But what if it were true? 

Chen Ping’an continued to rest his chin on his hand, gazing out at the heavy snow. 

At this moment, that ferry belonging to Liu Xianyue should be nearing South Powsa Continent. 

And on that ferry, which had long departed from the Upside-down Mountain, 

Liu Xianyue was inside, reading by lamplight, with a seal resting on the table. 

The inscription read: “First Seal of Great Sword Immortal Chen Ping’an, retained by Brother Liu Xianyue.” 

The text inscribed read: “Moving Mountains and Draining Seas.” 

Liu Xianyue glanced at the seal and smiled knowingly. 

What a kid; he should learn to brag like himself. 

At the Upside-down Mountain, within the hall of the Spring Banner Pavilion, heavy snow fell upon the world outside. 

Mi Yu quietly asked, “Hidden Official, will it really end like this?” 

Chen Ping’an countered, “Did I say it was over?” 

Mi Yu replied, “It seems you did.” 

Chen Ping’an said, “I often don’t believe my own words.” 

Mi Yu immediately understood, saying, “Got it!” 

Chen Ping’an shot a sidelong glance at the big sword immortal Mi Yu. 

Mi Yu then directed his gaze toward the idle Shao Yunyan by the door, asking, “Sword Immortal Shao, do you have any good tea or wine at your place? It’s rather inappropriate for the Hidden Official to sit here like this.” 

Shao Yunyan smiled but remained silent, making no move. 

Mi Yu then pulled out a jar of fairy wine and presented it to the Hidden Official. 

He stood up to serve the wine, placed it on the table, and gracefully turned around to take his seat. 

Everything flowed naturally, without a hint of awkwardness. 

The owner of the Spring Banner Pavilion at the door felt embarrassed for this Jade Purity realm sword immortal. 

At that moment, Mi Yu was undoubtedly unaware that he would soon become the number one lackey of the Hidden Official, destined for that role. Such is fate. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 748: The Sun Sets, The Moon Rises

In a moment, the only sound in the room was the rustling of pages. Each shipowner, skilled in business and accounting, was deep in their calculations, as was their forte and a part of their craft. 

With the hidden lord's permission, the Sword Immortals had departed for the most part. Li Cai, Ku Xia, Yuan Qingshu, Xie Zhi, Song Ping, and Pu He had all returned to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Only Mi Yu and Gao Kui remained. 

Shao Yunyan continued to sit by the entrance. A dignified Sword Immortal guarding his own territory was indeed a rare sight. 

Xie Songhua needed to personally "escort" a ship across the Aihai Continent to leave the Upside Down Mountain, so she naturally would not leave Chunfan Studio just yet. 

Could the words of a Sword Immortal be merely for scaring people? 

Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan also needed to stay. In the future, specific trade dealings would still require these two, alongside Shao Yunyan, to coordinate business with the ships of the Eight Continents right here in Chunfan Studio. 

Tonight's transaction at Chunfan Studio was not trivial. 

In the vast territory of the Haoran World, hundreds of dynasties, sects on the mountains, and influential families of immortals would be set in motion due to tonight's dialogue. 

Chen Pingan remained seated in the main position, sipping the wine brought by Mi Yu, not urging any ship owner. He held the wine pot in one hand, while the other gently opened and closed into a fist.

Nalan Caihuan was perhaps the one in the room who harbored the deepest hatred towards Chen Pingan. 

Gao Kui’s purpose for coming here was singular: to kill Nalan Caihuan! 

With such intense hatred, there was often more fear than hate involved. 

Nalan Caihuan's greater fear lay in the words spoken by the young hidden lord, “I can conduct business with these outsiders while pinching their noses, but how can I not tolerate someone from my own side who holds real power? That makes no sense. Nalan Caihuan, I assure you, the Nalan family won't suffer too much loss. If fortune smiles upon us, there might even be profit. As for luck, I can't guarantee anything.” 

Nalan Caihuan had also assured some matters. She felt she had truly come to an understanding with the young hidden lord, exchanging heart-to-heart sentiments. 

However, this not only failed to change her current predicament but instead brought about her greatest fear: Gao Kui still had not left Chunfan Studio and was quietly sitting nearby, drinking not the local brew but the wine from Bamboo Sea Cave.

Nalan Caihuan calmed herself and began to ponder all the details of tonight’s discussions, seeking to understand the young man more thoroughly. 

She had previously had little real interaction with Chen Pingan or the second shopkeeper; they had only discussed matters once after he became the hidden lord, and it hadn’t been particularly pleasant. 

Nalan Caihuan recalled the young hidden lord's closing words, which felt like a final verdict. 

The way scholars meticulously choose their words could be truly terrifying. 

According to the customs of the Haoran World, it should have been “persuading with emotion, explaining with reason,” yet Chen Pingan insisted on saying “explaining with emotion, persuading with reason” instead. 

Emotion referred to the ties of kinship, a sentiment long forgotten by the merchants of the Nine Continents but still cherished by the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Reason was simpler: it was the Sword Immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall, who could take heads with flying swords. 

Only after that did the most vulgar and materialistic aspect of wealth come into play, where everyone sat down, speaking properly and conducting business fairly. 

Yet before this, Chen Pingan’s most ruthless threat was not the immediate threat of a Sword Immortal killing, but rather a cut that pointed directly at some ship owners' vested interests. 

Disregarding any morality, business rules, or sect relationships, Chen Pingan chose to confront his opponents head-on, such as Wu Qiao, Tang Feiqian, and the reputations of two fifth-level practitioners in the vicinity of the private residence in North Julu Continent's Dili Mountain. 

It was a life worse than death. 

Of course, there was also the life of Dai Hao from the “Southern Ji” Jiang Gao Terrace, and Liu Shen, the manager of the “Rainbow Dress” ship. 

When it came to death, death it would be. 

Don’t talk to me about sect foundations or the consequences of breaking off trade; as long as anyone stands up from their seat, the Sword Qi Great Wall would only target that person before the young hidden lord. 

Many of the proper and prestigious sect masters of the Haoran World, especially the proud offspring of wealthy families, might not be able to come to an agreement on such matters, and it could even lead to a complete falling out. 

However, discussing this with the merchant class present here, who had long ceased to be purely cultivators, was the most effective approach. 

The true turning point in all of this, of course, lay in the documents Mi Yu had produced. 

Without them, no matter how many calculations Chen Pingan made, once dozens of ship owners left Chunfan Studio and Upside Down Mountain, he would only end up dragging the entire Sword Qi Great Wall into resentment, with no benefit to himself. Perhaps the hidden lord could continue to act, but the financial authority of the Sword Qi Great Wall would have to revert to her and Yan Ming. In this process, the Sword Qi Great Wall would suffer the most, inevitably being harshly dealt with by these merchants. 

Nalan Caihuan regained some composure, finally realizing how to interact with the young hidden lord. 

In terms of appearance and demeanor, Nalan Caihuan was indeed a great beauty. 

Thus, Mi Yu cast her a glance. 

Then he shook his head, his eyes filled with a mix of pity and disdain, turning away from Nalan Caihuan and continuing to rest his eyes. 

If Nalan Caihuan could sway a man’s heart purely with her looks, then Mi Yu could surely captivate women just by his appearance. 

Sitting across from them, the resentful and deeply troubled Yuan Ying lady caught sight of this exchange and felt her gloom slightly lifted. 

This heartless man, who should be punished a thousand times over, had not spared her a single glance after uttering that blasphemous statement, repeatedly casting his gaze elsewhere, deliberately avoiding her each time. 

If Mi Yu had no feelings for her, would he be so deliberate? 

Moreover, it was said that Nalan Caihuan had once harbored feelings for Mi Yu, yet she still failed to approach him, unable to become a pair of celestial partners with him in the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

Thinking this way made her feel she had triumphed over Nalan Caihuan. 

Looking at Mi Yu, whose expression was desolate and lonely, she turned her gaze to the beautiful scenery of heavy snow outside, lost in thought. 

Compared to the previous sycophantic demeanor he had when serving wine to the young hidden lord, he was now a different person altogether. 

She felt inexplicably pained; now that they were both fifth-level Sword Immortals, how could Mi Yu still be so humiliated in his homeland? 

Someone like Mi Yu deserved to die! 

But liking him was, after all, still liking him. 

Both were out of her hands, leaving her feeling helpless. 

Chen Pingan rested his chin on one hand, observing the various human emotions unfolding, and upon noticing Mi Yu’s subtle changes, couldn’t help but feel a measure of respect. The lovesick person could only be moved by their affection; Mi Yu, this remarkably talented heartbreaker, if he devoted himself solely to romantic pursuits in cultivation, should have reached the level of ascension by now. He could probably contend with Jiang Shangzhen on the path of enlightenment. 

Chen Pingan intended to find an opportunity to vent the frustrations of these lovesick women by giving Mi Yu a good beating, one he wouldn’t be able to retaliate against. 

Xie Songhua appeared troubled, contemplating the "Southern Ji" Jiang Gao Terrace and the "Rainbow Dress" ship managed by Liu Shen, both of which she couldn’t afford to miss. This female Sword Immortal's gaze flitted restlessly, her bamboo box of sword intent creating ripples that never ceased. 

Now that things at Chunfan Studio were settled, she still had several personal grievances to address. The crew from Aihai Continent was the first to speak up, but when they finally stood to speak, it appeared they were seeking death, and they were the most numerous among the Aihai Continent group. 

Looking at Wei Jin and Yuan Qingshu, and then at the cultivators from Baoping Continent and Nanpusa Continent across from them, weren’t they all showing great respect to the two? 

What? Just because I’m a woman, I’m not a Sword Immortal anymore?! 

Dai Hao, trembling with fear, had no choice but to take the initiative to ask the young man, who was slowly drinking, cautiously inquiring, “Lord Hidden, what about Xie Sword Immortal?” 

Dai Hao didn’t even dare to lift her gaze toward the main seat; she had no choice but to forget about manners for the moment. Otherwise, if she raised her head, Xie Songhua, a terrifying Sword Immortal who could easily take down even a Jade Purity Realm demon, would definitely notice her. 

Chen Pingan smiled, “Do you remember what Xie Sword Immortal said when she first met you all tonight? Think carefully.” 

Among all the ships from Aihai Continent, if anyone was most in need of money, it was Xie Songhua personally escorting their ship. If she did not escort it properly, they could blame her. 

Dai Hao breathed a sigh of relief. “Thank you for the reminder, Lord Hidden.” 

Wei Jin deliberately chose not to join Li Cai and the others, instead opting to leave last on his own. 

Chen Pingan stood up, “I’ll see Wei Sword Immortal off first. Mi Yu, you’re responsible for answering any questions from the guests. Whether deals are struck or not, just note them down. I’ll say this once again, once seated, everyone here is a merchant. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Whether one earns a lot or a little is up to each individual’s abilities. I’m no exception; tonight at Chunfan Studio, the rules for making money will be even greater than the title of Lord Hidden.” 

Chen Pingan looked toward Liu Shen, the shipowner of the "Rainbow Dress," and then to Liu Yu of the "Fuzhong" ship from Liuxia Continent, smiling as he said, “I’d appreciate it if the two of you could help keep a record of the discussions.” 

Chen Pingan accompanied the Sword Immortal from the Wind and Snow Temple to the entrance of Chunfan Studio. 

Wei Jin said, “I don’t really like to meddle in other people’s affairs, but I have some questions. Can I ask?” 

“There’s nothing you can’t ask, nor anything I can’t answer.” 

Chen Pingan smiled, “I’m very glad to meet a Sword Immortal from Baoping Continent here at the Sword Qi Great Wall, and you’re not at all inferior to other senior Sword Immortals.” 

Chen Pingan continued, “That’s the truth, no matter whether you believe it or not.” 

Wei Jin chuckled, “If you hadn’t said that extra sentence, I would have actually believed you.” 

Chen Pingan said, “Just ask.” 

Wei Jin then asked, “All the outsiders, including Xie Zhi, don’t want to gain anything extra from tonight’s affair. Why did you insist on coming to Chunfan Studio beforehand to conduct a transaction? Isn’t that... overkill? Or rather, it shouldn’t be like that. Let’s change the question: you said you wouldn’t let any Sword Immortal leave the Upside Down Mountain empty-handed, nor would you allow anyone to play the villain in Chunfan Studio, but you didn’t specify what the compensation would be. How can you say for sure that you won’t let the Sword Immortals be disappointed? What exactly do you consider compensation?” 

Chen Pingan hesitated for a moment before slowly replying, “In terms of sentiment, it’s about hoping good people get good rewards. In terms of business, I just don’t want the Sword Qi Great Wall to owe anyone favors anymore. It’s straightforward; we’re doing business with these outsiders in good conscience. As for the compensation you inquired about, it varies from person to person, and I won’t elaborate too much, as it involves the privacy of the Sword Immortals.” 

In addition, Chen Pingan didn’t hold back, “But there is a bottom line I can state clearly: in the future, any outsider Sword Immortal who still has the chance to return home can take at least one potential candidate for a lower fifth-level Sword Immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall. Those who are unwilling to take anyone will receive other forms of compensation. Those willing to take one or two more, as long as the Sword Qi Great Wall has such promising candidates, may take them as well.” 

Wei Jin could only smile bitterly and shake his head. 

What kind of reasoning was this? 

Outsider Sword Immortals, intercontinental ships, candidates for Sword Immortals that the Sword Qi Great Wall had yet to develop—past, present, and future—all accounted for. 

And if these young and talented Sword Immortal candidates had a chance to flourish in the Haoran World, what kind of scene would that create? 

Moreover, those outsider Sword Immortals who take on the role of teachers, regardless of their individual temperaments, are still brave enough to come to the Sword Qi Great Wall and risk death on the battlements; wouldn’t they be inclined to teach these disciples with great care? 

Once these children grow up and eventually rise across the continents, would they not band together? And those returning Sword Immortals who have left the Sword Qi Great Wall would also likely band together. 

To take it a step further, even if the Sword Qi Great Wall were to fall in the future, wouldn’t their meeting place become another form of the Sword Qi Great Wall? 

Wei Jin smiled. 

He looked forward to that scene. 

This was Wei Jin looking forward, but if he were to look back... 

He couldn’t help but recall the first time they met; Wei Jin remembered that the young man next to him was a clumsy, timid lad back then. 

And that young man had a very clear and bright gaze. 

Wei Jin stopped walking, sighed, and turned to look at Chen Pingan, who habitually rubbed his hands to keep warm. “You, an outsider, why do you bother thinking so far ahead for the Sword Qi Great Wall?” 

Chen Pingan smiled, “I have a wife here; you don’t. How can you compare with me?” 

Wei Jin shook his head, feeling like drinking again, not wanting to discuss this matter. 

Chen Pingan had been straightforward with him regarding his own future plans, and the elder Sword Immortal had been present at the time. 

Wei Jin had no intention of refusing. 

He just hoped he could match up to Xie Songhua from Aihai Continent and establish his own achievements worthy of the "Celestial Platform" at the Sword Qi Great Wall before heading to Fengyao Continent to accomplish that task. 

Wei Jin had no particular attachment to the Wind and Snow Temple; once his master left, he had long since let go of it. However, since his master had entrusted him with the "Celestial Platform," he needed to do something. 

The elderly cultivators of the previous generation valued face, and as a disciple, Wei Jin had to help his master earn it, so he wouldn’t be left silent when visiting the grave in the future. 

Chen Pingan said, “Can I share something I’ve never mentioned to anyone?” 

Wei Jin replied, “If it’s not calculated, I’ll listen.” 

The Wind and Snow Temple’s Wei Jin, with his sword opening the night, was yet to arrive. 

That kind of Sword Immortal bearing. 

Song Yusheng from Shushui Kingdom, facing an army alone, stood against an entire nation. 

That kind of warrior spirit. 

Ding Ying from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, whose true opponent was the Dao itself. 

That kind of ambition to compete with heaven. 

These were the battles Chen Pingan recalled most vividly. 

Hearing Chen Pingan’s words, Wei Jin chuckled, “What you’re saying doesn’t seem to matter much regarding realms.” 

Chen Pingan nodded, “It doesn’t matter much.” 

Wei Jin left Chunfan Studio. 

Chen Pingan turned back alone, retracing his steps. 

Halfway back, he crouched next to a courtyard, scooped up the snow, rubbed it on his face, took a deep breath, and formed a solid snowball. 

Shao Yunyan stood behind the young hidden lord, chuckling softly, “Sword Immortals kill without shedding blood; tonight, Lord Hidden’s actions are quite similar.” 

Chen Pingan shook his head and smiled, “Not so wonderful. It’s like a family with a thick foundation; the younger generation relies on their elders’ power to act. They have their own abilities, but it’s not as grand as imagined.” 

He casually threw the snowball onto the roof, tightened the golden cord of the jade token at his waist, “If it were Yan Ming or Nalan Caihuan sitting in my position, they could accomplish the same thing. What they lack is not heart and calculation, but simply this jade token.” 

Shao Yunyan shook his head, “I doubt that.” 

Chen Pingan smiled, “If everyone were as perceptive as you, Mr. Shao, knowing the difference between sincere words and polite ones, and being able to hear the unspoken meanings, it would save much effort.” 

Shao Yunyan remarked, “If there really needs to be an apology, it would involve Sun Juyuan and Mi Yu. As for who lays out the money for the compensation, whether it’s Yan Ming, Nalan Caihuan, or myself at Chunfan Studio, the order doesn’t really matter; what Lord Hidden needs to keep in mind is just how far the compensation must go: whether to lose entirely or split it three ways.” 

Chen Pingan replied, “Let’s start by covering half; if that time comes and there’s no improvement in financial operations or unexpected events cause Yan and Nalan families to incur losses, then Mr. Shao will have no choice but to sell off Chunfan Studio cheaply.” 

Shao Yunyan chuckled, “That’s fine. Actually, I’m not afraid of surprises; I’m just afraid of the lack of procedure in doing things.” 

Chen Pingan said, “If we want to prevent those ship owners from leaving Chunfan Studio and still being unable to warm up to one another, we can’t rely on someone like the young man who once disrupted the situation and united the hearts of people into a single cord. To accomplish this, we must first let them feel disheartened and lose complete trust in their former allies, creating a façade of unity while being divided at heart. My earlier somewhat ambiguous and half-truthful words were ultimately not solid facts; those old foxes among them are often the ones who won’t shed tears until they see the coffin; without suffering a stick of hardship, they won’t know the sweetness of a jujube. Therefore, I will be doing some underhanded deeds soon, many of which may require Mr. Shao to lend a hand. During this period, if I need any Sword Immortal’s assistance, just ask.” 

Shao Yunyan humorously inquired, “Lord Hidden, without discussing human sentiments or visions, do you think this style of doing things is deserving of the elder Sword Immortal’s special regard and high expectations?” 

Chen Pingan chuckled, “You shouldn’t speak so frankly, Mr. Shao.” 

Shao Yunyan replied, “Friends should speak without reservation.” 

Chen Pingan scooped up some snow again, lightly clapping his hands, sending snowflakes flying, and slowly said, “Doing things well is always harder than reasoning and being a good person.” 

To outsiders, a person who does not reason at all actually has many justifications supporting this “lack of reason.” A person who enjoys making money and can indeed make money has actually paid many prices they don’t consider costs. 

What? Such people exist? 

Oh, so it’s this kind of person. 

With vision clouded, bumping into obstacles everywhere, one can only leave it to fate. 

With a clear vision, when the world is bright, many unpleasant sights come into view. 

One suffers. 

One is troubled. 

Shao Yunyan declared, “To deny the goodwill of the entire world based on one’s own suffering is not good. To deny the joys and sorrows of others with grand visions is equally not good.” 

Chen Pingan stood up and smiled, “You truly have insight into human hearts, Mr. Shao; you are indeed a learned person.” 

Shao Yunyan chuckled, “Not as much as the Hidden Lord.” 

“Where is that?” 

“Just being polite.” 

They quickly became familiar, sharing warmth and camaraderie. 

“Brother Shao, didn’t you leave a gourd vine behind? I just want to take a look, to see the world; you don’t need to look at me like I’m a thief.” 

“Indeed, not a single gourd for cultivating swords was left behind; they were all taken by that little girl Lu Sui to North Julu Continent. If you don’t believe me, feel free to search; if you find one, I’ll give you another.” 

“Alright, please send me a layout of Chunfan Studio; I might frequent this place in the future, and with such a large estate, I wouldn’t want to get lost.” 

“I don’t think that’s necessary.” 

“Brother Shao, if you keep being so uncooperative, we’ll truly become a laughingstock among the brothers.” 

“Not at all.” 

The ship manager from North Julu Continent had no objections to the extensive inventory and tedious pricing in that hefty book. 

In fact, compared to the meticulous scrutiny of other ship owners and managers, those old practitioners from North Julu Continent flipped through the book casually, either drinking or having tea, each feeling relaxed and at ease. 

They originally didn’t make much money, but now had the opportunity to earn more; what more could they hope for? 

At the Southern Pusa Continent ship, there were minor objections. 

The old shipowners from the Fufeng family and Ding family in the Old Dragon City of Baoping Continent had some small disagreements as well. 

The shipowners from the Central Land, Aihai Continent, and Fengyao Continent had not yet spoken. 

The shipowners from Liuxia and Jinjia Continent were neighboring lands with generally good relations, with many resources and minerals being mutually exchanged for transport to the Upside Down Mountain, so they had been communicating in low voices. 

They planned to wait for Wu Qiao, Tang Feiqian, Jiang Gao Terrace, and Bai Xi to speak first before deciding their course of action. 

That hefty book was put together by Chen Pingan, with contributions from the Sword Immortals of the Hidden Lord lineage, taking turns to compile the files. Among them, Lin Junbi and other outsider Sword Immortals had made significant contributions, as many of the old records from the Hidden Lord lineage were unable to keep pace with the changing circumstances of the Haoran World. Mi Yu, having transcribed and consolidated the information, couldn't say he was intimately familiar with it, but in the hall, Mi Yu had already discussed and negotiated effectively with the shipowners. 

Liu Yu and Liu Shen had taken on an extra task, helping to record the discussions between both parties, and Shao Yunyan had prepared writing materials for them before leaving the hall to find Chen Pingan. 

The way to make money in the world is really just about expanding income and reducing expenditures. 

The young man pointed out that the products of the Eight Continents each had their strengths. Therefore, how to specifically explore sources of income and reduce the expenses of intercontinental shipping was a significant matter. 

The book contained prefaces in the sections on geography and shipping, filled with enlightening words, hoping for the Eight Continent ships to offer advice to their respective sects and clans. 

So tonight's discussions were not simply about bargaining between intercontinental shipping and the Sword Qi Great Wall. 

It was far more complex and far-reaching, involving all intercontinental shipping and existing trade channels that needed to be re-negotiated for goods, pricing, and returns. 

In the young man’s words, it could all be discussed openly; they could talk privately, or however they wished. 

Nalan Caihuan remained a cold observer, but the more she pondered, the more she felt there were many subtleties to grasp. If they could connect the dots, they would find it was all a straightforward calculation. 

If the Sword Qi Great Wall brandished its sword by threatening the ship owners' personal interests in business, that was one kind of bullying. 

Then the young hidden lord’s many hints reminded the merchants present to consider their own paths in cultivation and weigh their own gains and losses a bit more; the Sword Qi Great Wall not only welcomed this but even encouraged it, offering some small assistance. This was the Sword Qi Great Wall’s way of drawing the sword back into the sheath, representing a form of receiving. 

They guaranteed that all future business dealings for the ships would earn them a decent amount, at most serving as a further enhancement. 

However, if they could make all the ship owners collect money for themselves, turning the general business of their “own” mountains into real “self” businesses, that would be a timely assistance. 

In this ebb and flow, people’s hearts would no longer be as they once were. 

Yet how all these plans would pan out ultimately depended on whether they could withstand the scrutiny of worldly affairs and endure the many storms and unforeseen events to come. 

As they approached the main hall of Chunfan Studio, Chen Pingan suddenly asked, “Is there an exceptionally gifted accountant around?” 

Shao Yunyan sighed, “I once had a direct disciple who was an expert in this field; all the business of Chunfan Studio was managed by him without fault, possessing the ability of ‘creating something from nothing.’” 

Chen Pingan asked, “Is there a chance to call him back to work at Chunfan Studio?” 

Shao Yunyan smiled and asked, “Do you trust my judgment of character?” 

Chen Pingan replied, “Human hearts are hard to read; the difficulty lies not in how they were or are, but in how they will be in the future. Therefore, I can’t fully trust you. Fortunately, I have great faith in the Sword Qi Great Wall’s ability to correct mistakes.” 

Shao Yunyan nodded, “Then I’ll see if I can call him back. He has a natural gift for calculations. With tedious numbers, he has an innate intuition, and he enjoys it. I had given him a confidential letter to join a larger merchant sect in Aihai Continent; if he could first gain experience in the new Chunfan Studio, he probably wouldn’t need my letter as a stepping stone.” 

Chen Pingan said, “He must be brought back to the Upside Down Mountain.” 

Upon entering the main hall, a long negotiation began. 

Nalan Caihuan was again greatly surprised. 

The young hidden lord seemed to intentionally want everyone to be thoroughly tested on details and prices, seemingly unconcerned with rewriting a new book. 

Even the North Julu Continent ship manager, who had firmly decided not to speak, was pulled into the business table by Chen Pingan’s smiling inquiries about whether North Julu Continent had any similar or alternative items to those listed in the book. 

Back and forth, those old practitioners grew impatient; since the hidden lord made it clear it was all about business, they were not polite anymore. Once they opened their mouths, it was a matter of just a few words. 

With the North Julu Continent ship owners, who shared the same interests as the Sword Qi Great Wall, it was the same with Nanpusa Continent, and even the two quiet ships from Baoping Continent were beginning to speak more. 

Some new prices were agreed upon; the young hidden lord directly let Mi Yu erase the old text pricing in the book and rewrite it next to it. 

Wu Qiao and Tang Feiqian felt a little more at ease and then began to speak. 

Some prices had been raised, while others had inadvertently been lowered, but in any case, both sides were exchanging offers. 

Yan Ming no longer maintained his silence, and even Nalan Caihuan stopped being mute. 

More and more ship managers were openly calculating their profits in their seats. 

Earlier, more than a dozen Sword Immortals sat in attendance, with the younger hidden lord in the main seat, calling the shots. 

Now, with him being a seasoned hand at calculations, the results of who won and who lost were no longer certain. 

On the side of Aihai Continent, Jiang Gao Terrace from the Jade Purity Realm spoke a lot, and exchanges were taking place as if he was the one in charge of the Aihai Continent ships. 

The other ship owners had a certain degree of admiration for Jiang Gao Terrace; who would have thought that after having gone through life and death, he would still be so fearless? 

Jiang Gao Terrace appeared calm and exuded the aura of a fifth-level immortal, but internally he was cursing. Damn, he was being forced to bargain ruthlessly by the hidden lord; did he think himself so blind as to carry his own head in his hands like a hero? 

Chen Pingan looked up at the door. 

Before he knew it, dawn had broken. 

On the account books, there were no one-shot deals; they often included many clauses, amended repeatedly, and both sides clearly still had plenty to negotiate. 

The key was that as time passed, disputes began to arise between the continents and the ships; initially, they would hold back, but eventually, they no longer cared about appearances, with some even slamming tables and glaring at each other. After all, the young hidden lord didn’t mind these things; instead, he smiled, taking sides and saying a few inflammatory words, using the opportunity to press down prices, sipping some wine, and plainly starting to act shamelessly again. 

Everyone present was a cultivator, so they couldn’t be said to be fatigued, but whether they were tired in spirit was another matter. 

Yet all knew that once tonight’s affairs reached a final conclusion, then any slight benefit gained for their ships in this account would turn into an immense profit in the future, even if it was just a minor price difference. 

Thinking of it this way, even if it was tiring, there was a certain satisfaction in it. 

At noon, the hidden lord suggested they could return to their respective courtyards and discuss matters again behind closed doors. 

If they wanted to visit and discuss, Chunfan Studio would not obstruct them. 

The crowd in the hall immediately dispersed. 

Jiang Gao Terrace rose later, discreetly glancing at the young hidden lord, who smiled and nodded. 

Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan also intended to discuss matters. 

Chen Pingan first approached Gao Kui, saying, “Thank you. Sword Immortal Gao can return to the Sword Qi Great Wall now.” 

Gao Kui responded indifferently, “It was just a matter of standing up, glaring at a few women, and drinking a jar of Bamboo Sea Cave wine. What’s there to thank about?” 

Chen Pingan smiled, “Some words must still be said.” 

Mi Yu chuckled, “Gao Kui, when speaking with the hidden lord, please be polite.” 

Gao Kui had never had a high opinion of Mi Yu, who was known as the embroidered pillow of the Sword Qi Great Wall. In the past, if he encountered someone like Mi Yu, who always thought about sneaking under women’s skirts, he would have rather not looked at him at all or spoken a word. 

After last night, his impression of Mi Yu hadn’t changed much, but he was now willing to converse, though not with anything nice, “Mi Yu, don’t waste your life like this. If your brother Mi Hu weren’t dragged down by you, he would have already reached the realm of immortals. You should know that at first, Yue Qing’s talent was recognized as inferior to Mi Hu’s.” 

After saying that, Gao Kui strode away. 

Mi Yu lamented, “This Gao Kui deserves to be a lifelong bachelor. I only love sincere women, and women love me sincerely; genuine feelings exchanged for real intent—what’s wrong with that?” 

Chen Pingan said, “With your behavior, if you haven’t been killed by the bachelor Sword Immortals, you should thank the Great Sword Immortal Mi Hu.” 

Mi Yu turned to look at the still listless Aihai Continent female Sword Immortal, and just as he called out, “Xie Sword Immortal,” Xie Songhua smiled and said, “Please stay far away from me.” 

Sighing, Mi Yu exited the hall, crossed the threshold, and went to build a snowman, finding a secluded corner to create a figure that resembled a girl in shape but not in spirit. 

The Great Sword Immortal Mi chose a flowerbed at Chunfan Studio, where flowers and plants remained vibrant even in the heavy winter snow. 

Nalan Caihuan, that lady, was destined not to come to such places; she was beautiful but too focused on making money. However, the girl from the Central Land would likely come here, and she would surely love the blooming immortal peonies that thrived even under the snow. When she came to the flowerbed and saw the flowers, she would spot the snowman secretly standing beneath the leaves, and then she would realize her own infatuation. 

When outsider Sword Immortals leave the Sword Qi Great Wall, local Sword Immortals often host a farewell dinner. 

Just like in the past when Huang Tong from the Taihui Sword Sect was about to return home, the old Sword Immortal Dong Sangeng personally saw him off. 

Xie Songhua also needed someone to see her off. 

In fact, Chen Pingan was merely escorting her to the entrance of Chunfan Studio. 

Xie Songhua felt somewhat displeased. 

She thought she shouldn’t leave the Upside Down Mountain like this. 

Chen Pingan suggested she could wait at Jiaolong Valley, and if she was truly bored, she could stroll around Yulong Sect to relax. 

Xie Songhua immediately became interested, asking, “Does this mean we’re targeting Jiang Gao Terrace? What about Dai Hao? How about we take care of both? The favor I owe you, you’re good at calculating, so it should be put to good use. We’re all heading north anyway; Sword Immortals travel fast.” 

Chen Pingan shook his head, “Just wait for my news.” 

Xie Songhua complained, “So indecisive! If it weren’t for the deep debt of gratitude I owe you, I wouldn’t bother talking to you. Once I reach Aihai Continent, don’t come looking for me to reminisce; I won’t have wine to offer.” 

Chen Pingan smiled, “The two little girls at the Luanque Inn will be entrusted to you, Xie Sword Immortal.” 

As soon as Xie Songhua thought of this, her mood brightened, “They’re both good seedlings; I’ll take good care of them. It might be a bit difficult for them to become Sword Immortals like their master, but they won’t escape being Earth Immortal Sword Practitioners. Chen Pingan, thank you for this, but it doesn’t count as a debt; just let me say thanks, and that’s enough.” 

Chen Pingan gave a few more reminders, emphasizing that the two girls were from the streets of the Sword Qi Great Wall and were still very young, having never seen the outside world. Teaching them the sword and the way is crucial, but how to allow them to live freely in the Haoran World without forgetting their roots will require Xie Sword Immortal’s effort. Especially before they can defend themselves, they must not mention their origins from the Sword Qi Great Wall, and they absolutely must not be impulsive when outsiders bring up gossip about the Sword Qi Great Wall during their cultivation journey; no matter how hurtful the words are, they should bear with it, treating it as part of their heart training outside of sword practice... 

Xie Songhua felt a headache coming on, saying she understood, she understood. 

As the two approached the entrance of Chunfan Studio, 

Chen Pingan finally stopped his rambling and asked a strange question, “Xie Sword Immortal, can you brew wine yourself?” 

Xie Songhua was somewhat at a loss, “Of course not.” 

Chen Pingan smiled, “I have a friend who once said his greatest wish in life was, ‘What’s happening in the mountains? Pine flowers brew wine, spring water brews tea.’” 

Xie Songhua asked directly, “Chen Pingan, are you trying to tease me after being around that Mi Yu for too long?” 

Chen Pingan couldn’t argue. 

When it came to dealing with women, Chen Pingan felt he had never been good at it, far from the adept Sword Immortal Mi Yu, and even less so than Jiang Shangzhen, who had gone from enemy to friend. Truth be told, even his good friend Qi Jinglong far surpassed him in this regard. 

Xie Songhua laughed heartily, “You really are a child; no matter how clever your mind is usually, you still can’t joke.” 

Chen Pingan let out a sigh of relief. 

Xie Songhua clasped her fists, saying, “Lord Hidden, please stop here; there’s no need for your farewell. I don’t have the habit of walking around with men.” 

Chen Pingan laughed and returned the gesture, “I can’t imagine what kind of charming man could catch the eye of Xie Sword Immortal. If we meet again in the future, I hope you’ll let me see him.” 

Xie Songhua snorted, “Charming? Charming my ass! If he dares to pursue me, I’ll chop him down.” 

Chen Pingan helplessly said, “Xie Sword Immortal, it’s not that kind of charming.” 

Xie Songhua burst into laughter, “You’re still young; you really think I wouldn’t know this little bit of knowledge? If you’ve managed to make the Hidden Lord suffer a couple of times, I’m in a good mood; now I’ll take my leave!” 

Xie Songhua walked down the street outside Chunfan Studio, taking large strides. After walking a dozen steps, she waved her hand, speaking without turning around. 

Her words were very much in line with her character. 

“The backside isn’t that big, and the waist isn’t that slim; what’s there to look at? Look at Nalan Caihuan more, that Liu Shen isn’t bad either; the table is almost collapsing under the weight.” 

Chen Pingan could only smile bitterly as he turned and stepped into the residence. 

His fingers knocked lightly as he walked slowly. 

His brother would head southeast toward Tongye Continent and would first find the old Tianjun at Taiping Mountain, along with the mountain master, Song Mao. 

Wei Jin would head to Fengyao Continent. 

Shao Yunyan and a temporarily undecided great Sword Immortal would go to Nanpusa Continent. 

Shao Yunyan's journey would have its priorities, as he was limited by his current realm; being a Jade Purity Realm Sword Practitioner alone, he couldn’t bear that responsibility. Thus, Chen Pingan had been pondering the choice of the third Sword Immortal, needing to be a local Sword Immortal who had reached at least the realm of immortals. 

Chen Pingan had considered Lu Zhi, and also thought about Chen Xi or Qi Tingji, but compared to his brother and Wind and Snow Temple’s Wei Jin, they would definitely set out later. 

However, pulling one thread could unravel the entire cloth; this choice would bring forth many hidden connections, making it exceedingly troublesome. One misstep could lead to disaster, so he would have to observe further and wait. 

In truth, at that moment on the city wall, Chen Pingan had truly not trusted the old deaf man, who was a supreme demon yet adhered to rules, but rather the peak great Sword Immortal, Lu Zhi. 

This was not to say Lu Zhi was an insider of the wilderness; far from it, but Lu Zhi would definitely not wish to die on the city wall, belonging to that kind of person who would say, “Seeing the overall situation is settled, I’ll sheathe my sword and leave.” 

Chen Qingdu actually didn’t mind Lu Zhi making such a choice, nor would Chen Pingan harbor any contempt or neglect toward Lu Zhi because of it. 

And Chen Qingdu’s decision to have Lu Zhi protect the Hidden Lord lineage was, in itself, a hint. 

Chen Pingan couldn’t understand, but it didn’t matter; it wouldn’t change the outcome. If by chance he understood, then as the new Hidden Lord of the Sword Qi Great Wall, he should do what a Hidden Lord ought to do. 

For instance, ensuring Lu Zhi could leave the Sword Qi Great Wall with a clear conscience. 

As long as he didn’t betray the Sword Qi Great Wall in the midst of a great battle, turning his sword against his own and severing heads to claim credit in the wilderness, that was acceptable. 

This was the one bottom line set by the elder Sword Immortal, Chen Qingdu, but beyond this line, everything else was at one’s discretion. 

Throughout the millennia of the Sword Qi Great Wall’s history, without discussing those who willingly chose death, how many Sword Immortals, who did not wish to die, could actually have lived on grounds of sentiment and reason, could have avoided death, yet still perished? 

All these reasons ultimately boiled down to Chen Qingdu wanting them dead. 

If one were to place themselves in the shoes of that elder Sword Immortal, what would they feel? 

This was not just a matter of a few years, or a hundred years, but an entire ten thousand years. 

Does one’s true heart matter? 

Chen Pingan could only feel that if it were him, his heart would have long since shattered into pieces, broken beyond repair, either going mad as a means of escape or completely turning to another extreme. 

Such matters are better left unthought; overthinking is futile. 

Chen Pingan began to recall the words of his brother before their parting, originally thinking that his brother would not give him even a hint of a good expression. 

However, surprisingly, before leaving, his brother still bore a smile, his words were extremely calm, even half-jokingly speaking to his younger disciple, “Learning to write without mastering the sword first, using the sword without merit before studying—brother, don’t follow your elder brother’s example in this matter.” 

At this moment, the Sword Immortal Shao Yunyan had already entered the study. 

After seating himself at the writing desk, he picked up his brush and wrote down a sentence, lightly setting it down, appearing very satisfied. 

“From small things to big, being careful with the微细, day by day, learning should be illuminated by light.” 

Chen Pingan made his way back to the main hall, sitting in the main position, momentarily free of tasks, pressing his hand on the surface of the four-immortal table, which had originally been tightly connected, now showing some looseness and slight tremors. 

When Chen Pingan lifted his hand, the table quickly returned to calm. 

He stood up, walked a few steps, then turned back, crouching down to look at the table. 

It had been stable for ages. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 749: A Plentiful School of Fish in the Blue Waters

In the Jia Shen camp, the leader was not a sword cultivator but rather the wooden clogs of Liu Cha's only disciple, Bei Qi. Along with them were the gate disciple of Tuo Yue Mountain, Li Zhen, Yu Si, the swordswoman Liu Bai, and others.

The group appeared at the southernmost end of the battlefield where both sides were engaged in a duel of swords. Yu Si crouched down, pinching a small handful of soil between his fingers, gently grinding it into powder. After dusting off his hands, he stood up and said, “The ebb and flow of sword intent on both sides, the degree of conversion, is about as expected. This is the only good news left.”

Liu Bai frowned and asked, “Why would we jump into a trap we clearly see? Moreover, it’s not just us at the Jia Shen camp who feel uneasy. The Jia Zi camp is still ignoring us; what’s the situation? Our Earth Immortal sword cultivators are clearly being targeted, and several have already died. By yesterday, we had lost nine, right? How many more achievements do we have to hand over to the Sword Qi Great Wall? This is war; where is the sense in being so stubborn about face?”

Mu Ji, the wooden clogs, replied, “The Jia Zi camp hasn’t revealed the specifics either. They only mentioned that after the sword duel, including the predecessors Yang Zhi and Huang Luan, who made contributions, they would be bringing back the severed heads of the sword immortals from behind to offer to the Sword Qi Great Wall as a token of gratitude after the duel.”

Liu Bai shouted angrily, “What gratitude?! Do our Earth Immortal sword cultivators have to die for nothing, for there to be those hidden sword immortal heads? It’s two completely different matters!”

Mu Ji sighed, “Yeah. I also don’t understand. I don’t get why so many of our sword cultivators have to die here, as if they must die.”

Tan smiled, “At this point, what else can we do? We can only watch with our eyes wide open.”

In the distance, on the battlefield, a sword immortal from the savage world revealed their hundred-foot tall form, standing alone on the battlefield with a sword in each hand, slamming one sword into the ground.

Above the waterfall of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the sky suddenly unleashed hundreds of bright red lightning bolts, as if the gods were enraged, wielding whips of thunder, striking wildly at the earth.

The sword immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall responded in kind, using the clouds of sword energy to intercept the lightning, preventing it from hitting the sword formations and causing disaster to the mid-five realm sword cultivators below.

A slender female sword immortal from their side did not carry a sword; instead, her large sleeves swirled, and sword energy began to condense over several miles of land, transforming into countless flying swords that shot towards the magnificent sword formation of the Sword Qi Great Wall, which seemed to have descended from the heavens.

On the city wall, the great sword immortal Yue Qing confronted her with one of his fate-defining flying swords, the Skylark.

Amidst the torrent of magical treasures from the demon clan and this sword duel, several previously unremarkable cultivators from the savage world appeared to blossom. 

One demon cultivator, who was not a sword cultivator but a Qi practitioner from the cave level, unexpectedly obtained two ancient sword intents from the Sword Qi Great Wall after striking, which were of extremely high rank. This young man was destined to join the ranks of the hundred sword immortals, with ample resources flowing his way. Perhaps by the time he reached the Haoran world, he would even have a chance to establish a sect of his own in the sword path.

A Golden Core sword cultivator, who once thought his fate-defining flying sword was useless, achieved remarkable feats, forcing two of the enemy’s sword immortals to expend their full power in succession, saving two Earth Immortal sword cultivators, and causing the opponents’ flying sword techniques to inexplicably crash into the sword formations of the Sword Qi Great Wall. The Golden Core sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall lost two in quick succession, and the mid-five realm sword cultivators below the Earth Immortal level suffered heavy losses, directly retreating from the battlefield.

This Golden Core sword cultivator was ordered to retreat from the battlefield, later being assisted by a senior in the Ascension realm who used illusions to allow him to re-enter the battlefield several times, specifically targeting the powerful strikes of enemy sword immortals.

As for how this Golden Core sword cultivator could foresee the sword immortals’ strikes, only the Jia Zi camp knew the truth, and the Jia Shen camp had no right to question it.

Additionally, a pair of Nascent Soul sword cultivators broke through to the upper five realms during the battle.

Without these “glistening adornments,” the sword cultivators’ duel in the savage world would be a joke.

Because the rate of losses among the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, compared to the predictions of various military camps, was quite different, significantly slower than expected.

Mu Ji remarked, “In war, it’s all about people and money. The losses on the enemy’s side are less than anticipated, but fewer doesn’t mean no casualties. Next, we must see about the divine money; in fact, this is even more crucial than the sword cultivators. Right now, the spiritual energy of the sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall is showing signs of drying up, and the spiritual energy on the battlefield is so muddled that neither side can draw from it. Meanwhile, we’re backed by the entire savage world, and with the help of two seniors using their great powers to draw energy, two streams of spiritual energy are converging here like rivers, continuously flowing towards us. But how much spiritual energy can that city wall behind accumulate? As the war goes on, how much can it support the sword immortals’ full power? The Yi Wu military camp has long conducted precise calculations on this. As long as nothing unexpected happens, the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall will only die later, but when they do, it will be extremely fast and numerous.”

Yu Si laughed, “It’s even quite possible they’ll end up exhausting themselves quietly, even if they summon their flying swords, they won’t be able to retrieve them.”

Liu Bai said solemnly, “The premise is that there are no unexpected events! That there’s no unforeseen source of spiritual energy for the Sword Qi Great Wall! But after this battle, haven’t we received plenty of unexpected surprises?!”

Mu Ji nodded, “Then let’s roughly calculate the ferry boats from the eight continents of the Haoran world. Let’s not even mention the North Ju Lu continent; if they were to pull out half of their resources, it would be possible. Fortunately, only the North Ju Lu continent can do something like this. The Tongye continent has no ferry boats; the closest to the Hanging Mountain would be the South Posa continent and the Southwest Fuyao continent. The Fuyao continent’s ferry boats, led by the Mountain Water Cave, have past grievances and wouldn’t be easy to deal with. Right now, they might be doing us a big favor. As for the Posa continent, they wouldn’t dare be too accommodating. Even if the boat owners have gone crazy and are willing to do everything to help the Sword Qi Great Wall, they still have to see if their sects dare to agree.”

Mu Ji laughed at this point, “Fortunately, the Sword Qi Great Wall has never been good at dealing with the Haoran world.”

Liu Bai, used to speaking in reverse, countered, “What if? What if someone from the Sword Qi Great Wall is able to persuade the ferry boats of the eight continents to lavishly supply the Sword Qi Great Wall?!”

Tan looked up at the Sword Qi Great Wall with a cold smile, “What do they rely on to persuade? Is it the face of the sword immortals? How can someone who could earn a fortune not do so? How did the ferry boat’s negotiator come to be? Are they expected to rely on the sword immortals to personally send divine money to them? As luck would have it, the Sword Qi Great Wall is most in need of pure divine money.”

Mu Ji looked up at the city wall and said, “If given the chance, I would really like to meet the person sitting up there and have a chat with him.”

Li Zhen said, “That also depends on whether he can survive until that day.”

Liu Bai’s mind sparked with inspiration as she was about to speak.

Mu Ji seemed to have guessed her thoughts and shook his head, “Unexpected events must be corrected by unexpected events. Over at the Hanging Mountain, there are some entities that won’t just sit by and watch.”

Mi Yu, having built a snowman and secretly picked flowers from the garden to dress the snow girl, adorned it with floral garments, mirroring how she looked when they first met.

When they reached the great hall, he spotted a young hidden official squatting on the ground, studying the table. Mi Yu stepped over the threshold, leaned against a small table, and curiously asked, “Hidden official, is this Four Immortals Table actually a valuable treasure hiding a hidden mystery? Planning to move it to the summer palace?”

Chen Pingan stood up, “I’m going out for a walk.”

Mi Yu straightened up and glanced at the Four Immortals Table, realizing it didn’t seem that valuable.

As one of the four private residences of the Hanging Mountain, Chun Fan Zhai was vast, with corridors and passages, ancient trees towering, especially famous for its unusual rock formations. The waterfalls and flowing springs harmonized beautifully with the flourishing plants. Chen Pingan and Mi Yu walked along a stone path, surrounded by mist and abundant spiritual energy.

Mi Yu asked, “Hidden official, allow me to ramble a bit more. To tightly guard one’s own bowl of rice while snatching from others is quite savory, but those people are not ordinary; they only offer benefits and still don’t remember.” 

Chen Pingan smiled, “Is it my fault for summoning so many sword immortals to support us, only for no one to die in the end?”

Mi Yu responded, “How could I dare?”

Chen Pingan explained, “With eleven sword immortals visiting the Hanging Mountain, the killing intent was so heavy that it couldn’t be faked. To put it bluntly, do sword immortals need to pretend to want to kill? Yet in the end, not a single sword was drawn. Do you believe it?”

Mi Yu said, “I don’t believe it.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “Therefore, Wu Qiu and Bai Xi and the others will believe it even less. Don’t be fooled by their later discussions; as merchants, they seem to return to their little world of accounts, but in truth, they are still worried about life and death. Many details, if you observe a bit more instead of just focusing on which of the boat owners are good-looking or flawed, it’s not hard to discover this truth.”

Mi Yu felt somewhat disgruntled.

Familiarity breeds comfort; this was his small world, but it couldn’t compare to the hidden official’s deep foresight. His only rival was the beautiful women of the world.

Chen Pingan stopped and turned to gaze at the nearby water pavilion and building, “Either kill a few more; the most powerful among those from the Central Land, Wu Qiu, or the strongest in combat, Jiang Gaotai, and the least significant, Liu Shen, who holds the deepest grudge against the Sword Qi Great Wall, must all be eliminated. Only by killing those who seem least likely to die can we force the enemy into a corner, leaving no escape, both in position and in heart.”

On the artificial hill, the jagged stones revealed small pines and cypresses growing between the crevices, lush and green.

Chen Pingan sat on a step, “If the situation were not thus, then don’t kill any, but keep them. Whom to kill, let them ponder; just give a hint, and smart people will help me pick who to kill, conversely hinting to me who would die with the least cost, requiring no reparations from Yan Ming or Nalan Caihuan, and may not even need an apology from sword immortal Sun Juyuan. Since they believe the Sword Qi Great Wall will definitely kill to establish authority, there must be deaths among the ferry boats to satisfy the 'Hidden Official' and the sword immortals. Then it’s a matter of killing friends rather than the poor path.”

Chen Pingan pointed at the twisted pines and cypresses, “If they can thrive in the wild marshes, they can surely live well here.”

Mi Yu suddenly became enlightened, the little bit of frustration dissipating.

Chen Pingan remarked, “Killing is not a game. Speaking from personal feelings, it would be satisfying to kill all those boat owners in the great hall. But if we consider it more, who should truly die? Bai Xi? He’s not the ancestor of the Mountain Water Cave. Wu Qiu? Why should he die? Jiang Gaotai, if it weren’t for my persistent meddling, would he have fallen into such dire straits due to his own desire to help himself and the ferry boats?”

Mi Yu fell silent for a moment, sitting beside Chen Pingan, and solemnly said, “Making a fortune from killing isn’t much fun, yet they all seem quite spirited and happy? If I were the Hidden Official, I would have acted much earlier. Of course, the consequences would be dire.”

Chen Pingan rarely offered comforting words to Mi Yu, “Sword immortals naturally only do what they ought to do. If I remember correctly, at my age, you were already a Golden Core sword cultivator, then at sixty-four, you reached the Nascent Soul realm, and at one hundred ninety-six, you broke through the Nascent Soul bottleneck. In fact, your talent among the many sword immortals is not at the bottom; rather, you rank quite high. Excellent talent ensures Mi Yu can rise to the upper five realms that many others dream of, but in this process, you’ve turned to familiar matters outside of sword training, which you genuinely enjoy. The outcome, in the eyes of outsiders, may not seem good, but you see no problem with it, at most feeling guilty towards your brother Mi Hu.”

Mi Yu felt somewhat awkward, “Hidden Official, you can speak freely; I’m just more interested in romance and love, flirting with women, rather than practicing swordsmanship and killing.”

Chen Pingan smiled, “A place’s environment nurtures its people. The Haoran world cannot produce so many sword cultivators, but the price for that is needing an outsider familiar with foreign customs to serve as this Hidden Official. But if I also get distracted, and my heart strays further from purity, then continuing down this path, even if I excel in scheming against people’s hearts, the bottleneck in my future cultivation will only grow larger. However, I can guarantee that as long as there are no major surprises, my achievements on the path of the sword should still surpass those of the Mi sword immortal, especially in terms of killing abilities.”

Mi Yu nodded, “Realm cannot solve all problems, but it can solve many.”

Chen Pingan replied, “Realm can solve a lot, but it cannot solve everything.”

Mi Yu praised, “The reason why the Hidden Official is the Hidden Official is not without reason.”

Chen Pingan didn’t respond to that, smiling, “Earlier, Shao Yunyan and I had a casual talk that pushed things along, indicating his stance. It’s roughly the opposite of what you’ve said; he’s trying to persuade me not to act impulsively and recklessly kill. The words were quite tactful, but if I don’t heed his advice, the next time we have a meeting, it’ll probably have to move to the Water Essence Palace or Lingzhi Zhai. Do you think Shao Yunyan is really just sitting at the doorway serving as a guardian for us at the Sword Qi Great Wall? A sword immortal’s temperament is never low.”

Mi Yu furrowed his brows tightly.

Chen Pingan waved his hand, “No need to hold a grudge against Shao Yunyan for that; as long as it makes sense, we’ll take the advice. Besides, afterward, Shao Yunyan wouldn’t mind us taking some ruthless measures. I’ve tested it, and he accepted it. Not only that, but he’s also willing to personally step in and agreed to help me find that merchant prodigy who’s good at cooking the books. So, after all the twists and turns, we’ve ended up with the result I wanted.”

Mi Yu softly said, “It’s a bit tiring.”

Not addressing him as the Hidden Official was generally considered Mi sword immortal’s heartfelt words.

Chen Pingan stood up, “You can’t just keep hitting people with sticks to confuse them; it’s time to offer some real benefits. Otherwise, when they come to their senses, they’ll still have some clever little moves. I can handle it, but I can’t afford to waste time.”

Returning to the main hall of Chun Fan Zhai, everyone had taken their seats.

Chen Pingan sat at the head seat, smiling, “No contention, no quarrels, no friends; since we’re friends now, I also have a small gift to give everyone.”

Unexpectedly, no one felt at ease; each person held their breath, many of the older boat owners had already tucked their hands into their sleeves, preparing to bolt at the slightest provocation.

With that row of sword immortals no longer present, this young Hidden Official was finally about to kill someone?

This young Hidden Official’s mind seemed vastly different from that of ordinary people; he could really pull it off!

Chen Pingan smiled, “It’s just a small gift for everyone; there’s no need to sit so rigidly.”

Mi Yu slowly stood up.

Several of the more timid boat owners nearly rose instinctively, but as soon as they started to stand, they realized something was amiss and quietly sat back down.

Mi Yu, with one hand behind his back, gently shook his robe sleeve, producing strange jade tokens that glimmered with treasure light and swirled with sword energy, each hovering in front of the fifty-four boat owners from the eight continents.

Mi Yu’s thoughts shifted slightly, and without any ripples, all the jade tokens instantly stood upright, slowly rotating so that those across from them could gaze in awe.

Everyone was too occupied to notice the abilities of a jade purity sword immortal.

Wu Qiu focused intently; the tokens were styled like the most ordinary of ‘no event’ tokens from the Haoran world. It was hard to speak of a front and back; one side was inscribed with “Sword Qi Great Wall,” and the other had “Haoran World” carved into it. However, on the side with the four characters for Sword Qi Great Wall, there were also two small characters, “Hidden Official,” and even smaller was a number: nine.

Wu Qiu quickly glanced at another place; Tang Feiqian’s was “twelve,” Jiang Gaotai’s was “sixteen.” The ferry boat overseer for Fuyao continent, Bai Xi, had the number “thirteen” in front of him. The boat owner of “Nishang” at the entrance, Liu Shen, had “ninety-six.”

Chen Pingan leaned against the Four Immortals Table.

Mi Yu started, “Don’t get caught up in the size of the numbers; in short, each is unique. This token is personally inscribed by the Hidden Official, and every single jade token contains the sword energy of two to three sword immortals. As for which sword immortals favored which tokens, aside from the Hidden Official, no one else knows how to deduce the answer. In any case, looking across the entire Haoran world, no one could replicate it. To say it’s valuable, it’s not exactly worth mentioning; you’re all merchants who’ve seen all sorts of treasures. But to say it’s worthless, it’s still a rare item, one of a kind.”

At this point, Mi Yu emphasized, “In the future, if anyone else wishes to obtain such a jade token, it will depend on whether they have the opportunity to meet the Hidden Official and whether they qualify to become a guest of Chun Fan Zhai. I can guarantee that it will be extremely difficult. Moreover, there are only ninety-nine of these jade tokens in total; no more will be made. Thus, the highest number will be ninety-nine. So if anyone sees a jade token with the number one hundred in the future, just consider it a joke.”

Shao Yunyan suddenly chimed in with a laugh, “I’m also a guest; why is it that I alone do not have a jade token? I see that the smaller the number, the more precious the guest. So I want that one with the small character ‘ninety-nine’ on it.”

Mi Yu didn’t dare to take matters into his own hands and turned to look at Chen Pingan.

Jiang Gaotai suddenly stood up, cupping his fists, and solemnly said, “Hidden Official, can I trade this jade token for the one with the number ninety-nine?”

This time, it was not that the young Hidden Official had said anything to him, but Jiang Gaotai genuinely wanted to exchange the current jade token for the one with the highest number.

A small gamble to stir feelings? 

It was hardly a small gamble. 

Jiang Gaotai had always trusted his instincts. During many crucial moments on the path of cultivation, Jiang Gaotai had relied on this inexplicable intuition to accumulate the wealth he had today.

Shao Yunyan smiled, “Jiang boat owner, are you robbing me? Isn’t that a bit too ungracious? Moreover, the smaller the number, the more likely it is that the sword immortals who infused their sword energy into the jade tokens have higher realms. Why bother fussing over the size of the number?”

Jiang Gaotai chuckled and turned back to cup his fists again, “I sincerely request that Sword Immortal Shao let it go.”

Shao Yunyan shook his head, “This matter is not negotiable.”

Chen Pingan remarked, “This jade token can be seen as a small gamble for all of you, to wager on which sword immortals’ sword energy is contained within. If you wish to exchange, it’s up to you. If you fancy the one you have, it’s completely fine; just remember to notify Mi sword immortal before leaving Chun Fan Zhai. Although I’m the one giving the gifts, I still need to keep track of who got which token. As for whether you give the jade tokens to your sects, keep them for yourself, or sell them off, treating them as mere jade tokens which aren’t valuable, that’s all up to you. Now, let’s not discuss such trivial matters; let’s continue with the important matters.”

Mi Yu resumed his seat.

Shao Yunyan and Jiang Gaotai sat down as well.

Earlier, on the way Mi Yu came, he felt a bit out of place, asking a question, “If I feel out of place, don’t those sword immortals feel out of place? Do they know these jade tokens are being given to these bastards?”

“They know; I’ve made it clear to each sword immortal,” Chen Pingan’s response was simple, “What’s there to feel out of place about? In the future, every time someone sees a jade token, they’ll mention the names and deeds of the sword immortals, their surnames, names, realms, and the great feats they accomplished, slaying which major demons. Perhaps even better than you, Mi Yu, could recite them by heart.”

Mi Yu immediately chuckled bitterly, “Hidden Official, I’m also a sword immortal! Why didn’t you mention it to me beforehand?”

Chen Pingan laughed, “Many sword immortals who agreed without a second thought have asked me in person whether there is any of Mi sword immortal’s sword energy among these jade tokens. I said no, and they were relieved. What do you want me to do? You think you should be treated differently just because you’re a prominent figure in the Hidden Official lineage? If I tear out the page for you in the ledger and place it at the front, would it make a difference? If you feel it would help and make you feel better, you can tear it out yourself and place it near Yue Qing or your brother Mi Hu’s pages. I could pretend I didn’t see it.”

Mi Yu felt a heart-wrenching pain as he felt his sincere feelings being crushed. 

At this moment, he felt no sense of awkwardness whatsoever. 

He only regretted that he couldn’t participate in this.

At that moment, everyone in the great hall had carefully tucked away their jade tokens.

This caution was not only due to the rare treasure they were being treated to, but also worry about inadvertently triggering the jade tokens to explode alongside the sword energy, or fearing that their actions would reveal their movements, or that all their words and deeds were being observed by the young Hidden Official. After all, every gentleman in the Confucian Academy bore such a jade token for this purpose.

Mi Yu felt a surge of emotions, recalling some of the guidance that the young Hidden Official had given him on the way here.

“With these merchants, no matter how much you sweet-talk them, bringing up old friendships, or promising benefits for the future, it’s all empty words.”

“Need to see the big picture through small examples.”

“We don’t need to explicitly state that they can obtain something from the Sword Qi Great Wall through this jade token. Let them guess for themselves. The answer that clever people come up with will be reliable enough, regardless of whether it’s right or wrong.”

The discussions in the great hall became smoother, with more disputes laid on the table, which didn’t necessarily mean it was a bad thing.

Until dusk, the meeting came to a temporary pause.

During this time, the various plots, the eight continents’ ferry boats jointly plotting against the Sword Qi Great Wall, one continent’s ferry boats banding together to plot against neighboring continents, and the various ferry boats within a continent plotting against one another. Mi Yu was truly not interested, but due to his responsibilities, he couldn’t avoid getting involved, making him realize for the first time that focusing on sword training wasn’t such a苦差事.

Everyone dispersed again, returning to their courtyards for secret discussions. In truth, after most of the sword immortals had left, the communication through words and thoughts in the great hall was already stable enough. However, having such a process still eased the hearts of the ferry boat managers crossing continents, at least making them feel more at ease. Otherwise, frequently glancing at the empty seats where the sword immortals had sat would create an invisible pressure that made it uncomfortable.

Chen Pingan continued to wander alone around Chun Fan Zhai, agreeing to reconvene for discussions in two hours.

However, Mi Yu, the sword immortal, had matters to attend to.

Because the young Hidden Official had instructed Mi Yu to carry out two tasks.

Facing those young sword cultivators in the summer palace, Mi Yu still felt somewhat superfluous. He hadn’t anticipated that upon arriving at the Hanging Mountain, the burdens on his shoulders would be quite heavy.

One task was to privately visit the boat owners and mention the words “gifts should be reciprocated.”

He had to subtly hint that this was a personal favor from the Hidden Official, not part of the large-scale dealings between the ferry boats and the Sword Qi Great Wall.

You, Mi Yu, would be responsible for receiving the gifts. Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan would not be suitable for this task.

Mi Yu then inquired about the final destination of these benefits.

Chen Pingan stated frankly that all would have to be handed over to Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan. However, before that, all the sword cultivators from the Hidden Official lineage would have the opportunity to pick one cherished item.

Mi Yu curiously asked if he would also get a share.

Chen Pingan laughed, “Of course, if you really can’t help but pity the beautiful, you can return two personal items from that Nascent Soul female boat owner back to her; consider it as you, Mi Yu, prepaying your reward.”

Mi Yu was greatly impressed; in this world, the one who understood him best was the Hidden Official.

The other task was to find Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan, so the three of them could come up with a catchy name for this Chun Fan Zhai meeting that would make all the ferry boat owners feel proud, making it seem like a grand event rather than one of coercion. At the very least, it shouldn’t let others think so.

They needed to ensure that everyone felt that discussing matters at Chun Fan Zhai was an excellent topic worth bragging about. As long as they got off to a good start, even if these merchants left the Hanging Mountain, all the ferry boat managers would naturally help promote and build momentum behind the scenes. Some of the small boat owners who originally had to hand over the jade tokens to their sects could conveniently keep them as private treasures.

The Qi practitioners of the Haoran world all care about face, so they would give them that; after all, the Sword Qi Great Wall and the Hidden Official lineage wouldn’t have to spend a single coin.

A total of eleven sword immortals personally came to host the guests. 

The boat owners had previously endured great hardships at Chun Fan Zhai, and after they left, as long as both sides had an unspoken understanding and a tacit agreement, once it was handled properly, these boat owners would have the chance to earn immense prestige, becoming a part of this grand tale.

Chen Pingan was truly just wandering around, casually crafting a large snowball hidden among nearby items, intending to give it to Guo Zhujiu, as the current Sword Qi Great Wall was sweltering in the heat.

Lingzhi Zhai would probably see booming business over the next few days.

This was a matter for the sects and schools, which could be noted down in accounts, but it was expected that everyone would still need to dig into their pockets to offer a decent piece of magical treasure, as gifts should come in pairs for good fortune.

An hour and a half later, Mi Yu returned to see the young Hidden Official.

Chen Pingan smiled and joked, “If the other party didn’t agree, it’s better than agreeing, granting you a free friendship? In the end, did she have autumn water-like eyes and scold you, telling you to roll out? But with your level of cultivation, you should have successfully kept that treasure.”

Mi Yu helplessly said, “Hidden Official, if you spent a little more effort on women, it would be incredible. I ended up leaving that treasure at the door.”

Chen Pingan hesitated for a moment, “Since I had you do two tasks, I’ll still give you another treasure. Once you return to the Sword Qi Great Wall, you can choose one to give to your brother.”

Mi Yu felt awkward once more.

He knew this was the good intentions of the Hidden Official and understood that his brother Mi Hu would feel pleased seeing him achieve a little something within the Hidden Official lineage, at least not just surviving.

However, Mi Yu ultimately found it difficult to do such things.

There are too many such small matters in life—saying thank you to someone, or apologizing to someone, is just something he can’t do.

The two walked side by side, and Chen Pingan slowly said, “I’m not asking you to deliberately play tricks to please your brother. If that were the case, I’d be squandering the efforts of you two and myself. A person calculates many things ultimately for the sake of not calculating too many matters. Your awkwardness stems from whether your thoughts or your brother Mi Hu’s thoughts are more important. You still haven’t figured it out. If we’re talking about giving and receiving, can you afford to owe Mi Hu? If Mi Hu weren’t burdened by you, he would have already been a great sword immortal alongside Yue Qing. Yet now he’s just breaking through to become an immortal, why is that? The entire Sword Qi Great Wall knows the answer. I suggest you see Mi Hu, not for anything else, but to let your brother know that all your efforts and sacrifices, Mi Yu, are acknowledged and you won’t play dumb.”

At this point, Chen Pingan didn’t want to sound too serious, so he joked, “Just be a bit more shameless; when you see Mi Hu, just say, ‘Brother, I don’t expect to reach the immortal realm in this lifetime, but for the sake of the old Mi family’s lineage and blossoming, I will definitely be significant within the Sword Qi Great Wall. In the future, those little fellows who call you uncle will definitely not be just one or two.’”

Chen Pingan concluded, “This is just my outsider’s perspective; how you actually feel is still very important.”

Mi Yu chuckled, “I also think… it seems pretty good. I’ll give it a try later.”

After Mi Yu left, Chen Pingan walked along a stone path where mountains and waters met, separating the artificial hill from the spring, the path covered with colorful pebbles that must have come from immortal mountains. Chun Fan Zhai didn’t often have many guests, so the pebbles were barely worn, reminding Chen Pingan of the Jade Crystal Cliff in the Chun Lu Garden of the North Ju Lu continent.

Coincidentally, Shao Yunyan was not far away, holding a delicate porcelain basin and tossing fish bait into the water.

Chen Pingan walked over, leaning against the railing as he watched the fish compete for food, saying, “How many little fish are in the blue waters.”

Shao Yunyan smiled, “Elegant and to the point.”

After a moment, Shao Yunyan asked, “Are there still worries at present?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “I’m worried that among the ferry boat managers, the sects have long conspired with the savage world, and I fear the conspiracy is deep enough that they would risk their lives to destroy the Chun Fan Zhai alliance. I’m also worried that some unexpected individuals from the Hanging Mountain might resort to brute force. Regardless of which concern arises, once it happens, no matter what the truth is, the result presented to the world will be that people have died under the swords of immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall. The ferry boat owners from the Fuyao and Aiai continents, especially Bai Xi from the Mountain Water Cave, have a higher likelihood of dying, and afterward, there will be plenty of nasty excuses that can be made, leading to chaos among the people, rendering all previously agreed matters null and void.”

Shao Yunyan questioned, “After doing so much, even if people die, there are loopholes everywhere that can’t withstand scrutiny. Can it really reverse the situation?”

Chen Pingan reached out to wipe away the snow on the railing, “People’s hearts don’t operate on so many rationales. Building a table and bench takes painstaking effort, but to smash it, isn’t it just a few hits?”

“To scheme against others, one must be prepared to be schemed against.”

Then Chen Pingan smiled and countered, “What if I hypothesized further: someone indiscriminately leaves the Hanging Mountain and starts a massacre against those ferry boat owners? Would they dare dock at the Hanging Mountain again in the future?”

Shao Yunyan’s expression grew solemn, “Regarding this matter, it seems it’s not right to speak to the ferry boat owners, but not speaking is also not right. If we say it, everyone will be inclined to profit and avoid harm; if we don’t say it, once something happens, they will never return.”

Chen Pingan leaned against the railing, “So, it’s not about fearing the unexpected, but about fearing an unexpected event that is clearly lurking in the shadows. As long as the other party is patient and doesn’t act, I can only accompany them until they tire.”

Shao Yunyan asked, “How to respond?”

Chen Pingan sighed, “Then I need to meet that great Tian Jun; hopefully, I won’t be turned away at the door.”

Shao Yunyan’s face took on a strange expression, “I just received news that he has already gone into seclusion.”

Chen Pingan rubbed his forehead, feeling a headache coming on, contemplating for a moment, “That’s fine; it’s almost like he’s helping me make a decision. I’ll accompany Sword Immortal Shao to the third candidate for the South Posa continent.”

It would be the female sword immortal, Lu Zhi.

In fact, the merits she had accumulated were already enough for her to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall.

It seemed she was more interested in traveling and training her sword in the savage world rather than in the Haoran world.

The premise was that she was willing to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall and take a position at the Hanging Mountain.

Otherwise, it wouldn’t matter if the title of Hidden Official was useless; it would be equally meaningless to bring out the great sword immortal.

However, even if Lu Zhi agreed to this matter, her early departure from the Sword Qi Great Wall would actually have considerable impact.

In reality, it was a matter of weighing the lesser of two evils.

Chen Pingan gently tapped the railing, discussing countermeasures with Shao Yunyan.

Should they leak some details about the Chun Fan Zhai meeting, to create an early impression and intentionally leave only Mi Yu, to entice the other party to weigh their options and act immediately?

Should they notify Xie Songhua, who had already gone to the Jiaolong Gully and Yulong Sect? With Lu Zhi, Mi Yu, and Xie Songhua, plus Shao Yunyan, the higher the opponent's realm, the better. Even a ferocious Ascended Realm demon would not escape calamity.

Two days later, the young Hidden Official returned laden with gifts and received quite a bit.

Sword Immortal Mi Yu remained at Chun Fan Zhai.

There’s no wall that doesn’t leak wind in this world.

The discussions at Chun Fan Zhai, within a single night, set the entire Hanging Mountain abuzz.

The general content revolved around the Sword Qi Great Wall negotiating the larger situation with the ferry boat managers; one side would provide swords, and the other side would provide money to jointly respond to the current sieging war from the savage world.

Mi Yu, Shao Yunyan, and Xie Songhua were hidden within three directions of the ferry boats. Even those three ferry boats had no idea about this, managing to allow a sword immortal to “escort” them.

The Southwest Fuyao continent, South Posa continent, and Eastern Baoping continent.

Quietly arriving at the Hanging Mountain, Lu Zhi would take charge there, ready to assist any sword immortal who might wander far.

On the “Wapan” ferry boat of the Fuyao continent, Bai Xi sat in the cabin, frowning slightly when a knock was heard at the door.

Before this Nascent Soul cultivator could open the door, an old man appeared within, removing the illusion to reveal a young man looking languid.

Bai Xi stood up and solemnly asked, “I didn’t know a senior was visiting. What business do you seek?”

The young man smiled, “Not quite a senior. I’m Bianjing, a small sword cultivator from the Central Land, here to ask about the details of the Chun Fan Zhai meeting, and to decide whether to start a massacre.”

Bai Xi fell silent.

The young man’s eyes turned pitch black as he wrote a line on the table, then said hoarsely, “Your ancestor from the Mountain Water Cave is an old friend of mine. That fate-defining magical treasure was once an opportunity I gave him. The words on this table should be told to every ferry boat manager before they die; don’t you find it strange why every ferry boat manager dies shortly after leaving their post? It’s all to hide this strange little secret. You, kid, have the best luck; born late, you have the chance to meet me and gain a massive fortune for free. This unbreakable Nascent Soul bottleneck of yours will naturally be broken with ease upon meeting me.”

Bai Xi immediately cupped his fists and bowed, “Welcome, senior!”

“Bianjing” took a seat and smiled as he asked, “You and the ferry boats, wouldn’t you be unaware if someone had acted against you?”

Bai Xi did not sit down and remained standing, saying, “The ferry boats have already been thoroughly searched, especially my residence. There’s absolutely no possibility of tampering, and as for that jade token, I left it in the private residence at the Hanging Mountain. Additionally, all my actions and words are reasonable; I even purposefully complained a bit afterward, merely for show for Chun Fan Zhai’s watching. That crafty young Hidden Official wouldn’t find any trace, and instead would dismiss any doubts.”

Bianjing smiled, “What jade token? Young Hidden Official? Tell me more.”

Bai Xi recounted the general idea of the jade token, receiving a great compliment from the young man in front of him for the thoughtful arrangement, although it was a pity it wasn’t meant for their world, and then proceeded to carefully describe the process of the Chun Fan Zhai discussions.

Bianjing nodded, “If this succeeds, it’ll be a huge problem; it was worth the risk of me coming here.”

After saying this, Bianjing burst into laughter, “You thought I was at the Immortal Realm, but you’re mistaken.”

Bai Xi once more cupped his fists in salute.

An Ascended Realm great demon!

Bai Xi cautiously asked, “Senior, when do you plan to strike?”

Bianjing glanced at this little ant, Bai Xi, who had the guts to speak, and slowly began lifting him off the ground, “You should ask for the ferry boat to be sunk after you strike, letting more die is no issue. Otherwise, our Mountain Water Cave would be highly suspected; it would only delay your future actions and greatly affect the situation.”

Bianjing nodded with a smile, “That’s a good point. Since you’re so clever, you’ve truly gained a great fortune.”

The Southeast Tongye continent had plans laid, but unfortunately, it was exposed early, only leaving the Fuji Sect and Taiping Mountain injured. One of the plans from the Southwest Fuyao continent was this Bianjing, who was born from Fuyao continent yet traveled to the Central Land, risking much to deceive that national teacher of the Shao Yuan dynasty. Fortunately, this young sword cultivator “Bianjing” chosen by himself was quite capable.

As for the South Posa continent, with Chen Chun’an present, it wouldn’t be worth the risk of death; there were no plans there.

Bianjing said, “I won’t rush to act; the risks are too great. The ferry boats scattered back to their homes, I won’t act against them for now. I’ll wait until the next time they earn more money and happily walk to their deaths.”

Bai Xi breathed a sigh of relief; this indeed was a safe course of action.

Otherwise, he would truly fear this senior would act recklessly relying on his Ascended Realm cultivation.

Bianjing chuckled, “That young man named Chen Pingan is smarter than you can imagine. There’s a jade purity sword cultivator hidden on the ‘Nishang’ ferry boat, should be the little lackey sword immortal Mi Yu you mentioned. I’m just here for a leisurely trip, no rush at all; I’ll accompany them for a bit longer. I want to see how patient these prideful sword immortals can be. If their patience is indeed good, I’ll just wait longer to strike.”

Bianjing’s smile faded as he stood up, Bai Xi feeling as if he were being choked, slowly being lifted off the ground, “You are just an ant; don’t blame others.”

Bianjing sneered, “Chen Pingan, you’re willing to exchange your life for mine? What are you thinking?!”

Outside the door, a familiar voice Bai Xi knew well seemed to be speaking on his behalf.

“Don’t blame others for being foolish.” 

Bianjing laughed, “Chen Pingan, you’re actually willing to risk your life to change mine? What are you thinking?!”

Outside, a young man, cursing and swearing, tore off the mask of a woman’s face.

Next to him stood Lu Zhi, who hadn’t removed her male disguise.

In addition, both of them bore the illusion cast by the great sword immortal Chen Qingdu.

Bianjing inquired, “How did you follow me?”

The young Hidden Official smiled, “Just like the Mountain Water Cave, gamble big to win big.” 

Just as Bianjing was about to make a move, he suddenly froze.

Because an elder in a Confucian robe, who should not have appeared here, showed up.

Bianjing laughed heartily, “Good good good! Not only have several sword immortals come, but you even invited Chen Chun’an!”

The old Confucian scholar replied indifferently, “My name is not one that you can call.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 750: Wandering Souls, All Like Dandelions

The reason Chen Pingan dared to show himself wasn't just because he stood beside Lu Zhi, one of the top ten sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall; more importantly, it was because Chen Chunan would be present.

In a battle of similar realms, while a great sword immortal excels at killing, they may not be as adept at saving lives.

Earlier, on the city wall, during that ambush, Mi Yu had exerted every effort to stop his fellow sword immortal who had an equal cultivation level, yet he was still a moment too late.

As long as Chen Chunan was there, however, there was no cause for concern.

After Chen Chunan spoke, he didn’t give the ascendant demon any chance to waste words. The world itself seemed to shift.

In an instant, Chen Pingan felt his spirit tremble, as if he had manifested an immense dharma form. Suddenly, he "ascended" to the highest point of the sky, able to overlook the entire expanse of the majestic realm. However, before he could take in the view, his vast dharma form was forced back into a speck smaller than dust, returning to the earth as if it had vanished into the intricate patterns of a palm.

When Chen Pingan finally regained his bearings and turned to look back, a phrase from a Daoist scripture naturally surfaced in his mind: "The Dao is elusive, hazy and indistinct, merging into the true void; the great emptiness is it."

Behind Chen Pingan hovered a massive orb, pure white and radiant, with faint outlines of pavilions and a large osmanthus tree, as if it were the moon itself adorned with fragrant flowers.

In comparison, Chen Pingan appeared as small as a grain of rice next to this celestial being.

He withdrew his gaze and looked up, where a colossal sun hung in the sky, even larger and wholly golden, with nothing else in sight.

This great sun continuously emanated strands of golden light, fluctuating and shifting rapidly.

There was also a small black dot, flitting erratically like an ink blot.

Countless thin white rays of light flashed through the air, capable of severing those golden threads in an instant.

It was likely that this was Lu Zhi confronting the ascendant demon known as "Border."

Chen Pingan hesitated for a moment, planning to sit cross-legged and immerse himself in this small realm, summoning his yet-to-be-named personal flying sword to engage with the grand flow of this microcosm’s Dao.

Unexpectedly, someone placed a hand on his shoulder and said with a laugh, "Some knowledge, if accessed too early, can be quite detrimental. It’s not that I fear you might steal it; it’s that the powers of your personal sword and my arts are not aligned within the same Dao."

Chen Pingan dismissed the thought and turned to respectfully bow to the elderly scholar in the Confucian robe.

Chen Chunan nodded and smiled, "I’ll just consider this a junior scholar paying respects to an elder. It’s not as if I’m a disciple from the lineage of the Sage of Literature, nor will I exchange formalities with you over our respective teachings."

After Chen Pingan stood up, he felt a flush of embarrassment. "I dare only to seek guidance, not to ask for the Dao."

Chen Chunan waved his hand dismissively, "Since we both share the surname Chen, we are of the same origin but different branches. Our surname is but a reflection of this, and the same goes for our scholarly pursuits. Furthermore, regarding the osmanthus tree in the Li Pearl Cave, the Chen family of the Yingyin region owes you a favor. That’s why I brought you in to observe the battle from a distance. To appreciate the prowess of a sword immortal is no small skill of yours. While I don’t worry about Chen Pingan of the Longquan County, I do keep an eye out for that old scholar and his proud disciple. Isn’t that 'just as expected'?"

Chen Pingan felt increasingly ashamed.

Chen Chunan reached out and pulled the sword immortal Mi Yu, who was outside the realm, into their midst.

Chen Chunan then reminded him, "Can’t see clearly? You might as well quietly contemplate your teacher's scholarly principles; perhaps your vision will clear up a bit."

Chen Pingan began to meditate inwardly.

With some seniors, there was no need to think too much.

Focus unwavering, Chen Pingan instinctively settled into a cross-legged position, his fists gently resting on his knees.

Sitting felt like his mind was drifting through countless ages, emerging from the endless cycle of the sun and moon.

Chen Chunan sat upright in the void, and upon hearing the scholar's insights, he smiled faintly.

Not only could Chen Chunan hear Chen Pingan's inner thoughts, but he could also easily draw out any ideas or notions Chen Pingan had, should he wish to.

Afterward, Xie Songhua and Shao Yunyan, having received word through their flying swords, arrived swiftly on their swords, breaking through countless waves and clouds, and found the "Wapan" ferry boat in the Mountain Water Cave, one after another welcomed by Chen Chunan into this realm of sun and moon.

The three jade purity sword immortals who arrived sequentially were all alike, showing no intention to draw their swords; they merely stood at their respective places, supporting Lu Zhi.

Mi Yu was more restrained, keeping a close watch on the battlefield. His refusal to intervene was to avoid complicating matters; as long as Lu Zhi maintained the upper hand, he would not strike.

The second to arrive, Shao Yunyan, true to his role as the owner of the Spring Fan Studio, directly began forging his sword using the abundant solar essence and lunar spirit present in the air.

Lastly, Xie Songhua, who entered this realm later, appeared far more relaxed compared to Mi Yu and Shao Yunyan. Upon entering, she glanced at the battlefield, deemed her assistance unnecessary, and began leisurely flying around on her sword.

This was a subtle indication of the different personalities among the sword immortals: Mi Yu seemed carefree, yet was actually the most restrained; Shao Yunyan was the most pragmatic and adept at calculations, while Xie Songhua's character was the most pure and free-spirited.

Chen Chunan said, "The situation is clear now. That ascendant demon has lost its true form, and the person from the border has been used as an external body for the Yang God to reside. The demon's hidden methods are a unique divine art, which is why it dared to approach the Sword Qi Great Wall. As long as this person does not stand on the city wall, even Chen Qingdu would not detect it. How did you discover it?"

Chen Pingan replied softly, "I placed three bets successively. First, I bet whether to leave the Summer Palace and follow a certain ferry boat away from the Inverted Mountain. Then I bet which ferry boat among those was more likely to be significant, and finally, I wagered whether you, old sir, would think I was playing games and be willing to come all the way from the Southern Posa continent. If you hadn’t come, even if I had guessed right on the first two, it would have been a wasted trip."

Chen Chunan laughed, "Then please elaborate. Don’t feel ashamed just because it has to do with 'gambling.' The hardest part of worldly knowledge is to articulate it well; making it accessible to others and relatable is even more difficult."

Just as Chen Pingan was about to speak, the ascendant demon crashed through Lu Zhi's sword strike, charging towards Chen Chunan and Chen Pingan.

The size of its dharma form loomed like a mountain overhead.

Yet, Chen Chunan did not even glance at it. He simply extended a hand and sent the half-formed ascendant demon, whose true form was hidden, crashing back into the battlefield. Not only did he strike it down, but its colossal body was also pressed into the golden sun, immersed in a sea of molten gold. Even when the demon roared in anger and soared thousands of feet into the air, it was still ensnared by those golden threads and harshly pulled back to the "earth."

Lu Zhi did not take the opportunity to strike either; she merely observed coldly, allowing the demon to escape and continue its confrontation.

Chen Chunan paid little mind to this.

The old scholar simply smiled, listening intently as the young man meticulously recounted the nuances of his three bets.

Back at the Summer Palace of the Sword Qi Great Wall, he tossed a small summer coin to decide whether to follow the "Wapan" ferry boat away from the Inverted Mountain. If it landed heads, he would do it; if tails, he would remain at the Summer Palace, waiting for the other party to take the initiative.

Previously, Chen Pingan had used a method of stopping and observing, albeit quite rudimentary, but it allowed him to discard a certain thought. As a result, the summer coin landed heads.

According to Chen Pingan's original plan, he should have stayed at the Summer Palace.

After some hesitation, he pressed down on the coin, prompting Guo Zhujiu to guess its outcome. Ultimately, Chen Pingan decided to leave the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Upon hearing this, Chen Chunan smiled and said, "So you initially wanted to determine your luck this way? If your luck was good, then you’d have to be cautious, and if it was poor, and you guessed incorrectly, there would be a chance for the opposite to occur?"

Chen Pingan nodded, "That’s right. I prefer not to engage in losing trades. I can forgo profit, but I absolutely cannot incur losses."

Chen Chunan laughed, "Continue."

Chen Pingan sought out the current figure of authority at the Inverted Mountain, a Daoist master he had encountered once before. Before the eldest disciple left, he had mentioned that after he drew his sword in the Jiao Long Gorge, this person had collected a significant number of dragon whiskers, benefiting greatly. "Junior brother, if you go find him about something, it shouldn't be difficult. If he refuses, just let him wait for my return to the Inverted Mountain and reason with him."

Additionally, with the spies placed by both the Sword Qi Great Wall and Cui Dongshan at the Inverted Mountain, when the last cross-continental ferry boat from the Spring Fan Studio departed, Chen Pingan obtained detailed records of all passengers boarding.

Before quietly returning to the Spring Fan Studio at the Inverted Mountain, Chen Pingan first gathered Lin Junbi, Xuan Can, and several other experts skilled in strategy and breaking the game from the Hidden Official lineage to help him sift through the most likely ten ferry boats that could cause unexpected incidents, including Wu Qiao, Tang Feiqian, and the "South Horn" ferry from Aiai continent, the "Wapan" from Fuyun continent, "Tai Gong" from Aiai continent, "Nishang" from the Immortal Islands, "Fuzhong" from Liuxia continent, one from both Southern and Northern Posa continents, and even the ferry from the Ding family of Old Dragon City.

Ironically, the greatest suspect could also be the one with the least suspicion.

At the outset, neither Chen Pingan nor Lin Junbi had thought that the Wapan ferry from the Mountain Water Cave was necessarily an insider hidden in the majestic realm.

Aside from selecting these ten ferry boats, there were also thirty-two suspicious ferry passengers.

Chen Chunan inquired, "That person from the border should be cautious and should not be among them."

Chen Pingan smiled, "Indeed, this person wasn’t listed initially. According to the original records, after leaving the Sword Qi Great Wall, the sword cultivator from the Shao Yuan dynasty of the Central Land, who is from the border, stayed in the Meihua Garden for a while before leaving the Inverted Mountain. However, it wasn’t with Yan Lu and Jiang Guancheng; instead, he chose to travel alone to Fuyun continent. The ferry boat that the sword immortal Lu Zhi and I initially boarded was Mi Yu’s 'Nishang.' After some investigation, we found no results, which was why we followed the Wapan ferry. After boarding mid-journey, I employed the simplest method, moving around to count the number of people, and discovered one extra person. Even so, I still dared not assert that a great demon was hidden on the ferry, nor could I claim the Mountain Water Cave had early ties with the wild realm."

Chen Chunan nodded, then humorously asked, "You didn’t choose to board the ferry following Xie Jianxian’s direction. Are you quite at ease with the Posa continent and Northern Julu continent?"

Chen Pingan shook his head, replying, "It’s more about trusting that a great demon’s mind is smart enough not to stir up trouble, not wanting to risk the advantageous situation of Tongye continent that was bought at the cost of two great demon lives."

Chen Chunan continued, "It seems you’re not worried that I might be angry about running around for nothing, just to speak of Tongye continent? Truly, you’re good at business."

Chen Pingan responded, "I sincerely request that you trust the Posa continent's insight just this once. The real gamble is that our Posa continent is the first and the greatest!"

Chen Chunan fell silent for a moment, then smiled with satisfaction, "Very well."

Meanwhile, Mi Yu continued to feign concern for Lu Zhi, with the great sun hanging in the sky, feeling as if it were within reach, the sheer heat making Mi Yu feel restless.

Shao Yunyan, seizing the opportunity, scooped up a handful of the golden lava that splattered outward, not daring to touch it directly, but carefully pouring it over his personal flying sword.

The osmanthus-carrying Xie Songhua asked loudly, "Old Scholar Chen, could you spare me some solar essence and lunar spirit? The kind I don’t have to return!"

Chen Chunan looked up and smiled, "Sword Immortal Xie, take as much as you like."

He glanced at the idle Mi Yu and said with a grin, "Sword Immortal Mi, could I borrow your sword for a moment?"

Mi Yu immediately removed his sword.

Chen Chunan reached out, grasped the sword, drew it from its sheath, and waved his sleeve, releasing a thick essence of moonlight. "This lunar spirit originally comes from the wild realm."

With his two fingers together, he gently stroked the sword’s blade, revealing an imperceptible groove. The rich moonlight flowed along his fingers, pouring into it.

Mi Yu's spirit swayed, nearly moving him to tears, and it was utterly sincere.

His personal sword's quality would undoubtedly be elevated, but more importantly, the cultured Chen Chunan personally helped him forge the sword! How could the sneaky Shao Yunyan, who forged his sword in a haphazard manner, compare? How could the forthright Xie Songhua, who asked for solar essence and lunar spirit, compare?

Chen Pingan shot a glance at Mi Yu.

The latter immediately understood, nodding in agreement. This was all thanks to the Hidden Official; he, Mi Yu, was most grateful for the kindness shown!

After helping Mi Yu complete the sword forging with the moonlight, Chen Chunan sheathed the sword.

The sword returned to Mi Yu in an instant.

Mi Yu cupped his fists and bowed, "Mi Yu thanks the cultured old sage."

Chen Chunan nodded and smiled, then turned to Chen Pingan, saying, "This matter was executed extremely well; ultimately, it was not the conduct of a gentleman."

Chen Pingan replied, "As of now, I’m not even a sage, so I’m certainly not a gentleman."

Chen Chunan chuckled, "You’re not unlike your teacher, who loves to cite titles. 'I’ve never been a sage or a gentleman.' 'You all forced this sage title upon me; did anyone ask if I was willing? Now that I am a sage, I’m terrified—what more do you want?'"

Chen Pingan remained silent.

Having acknowledged his teacher, he felt he should refrain from discussing the revered.

Chen Chunan sighed, "In Confucianism, one must study with rectitude and tranquility to illuminate virtue."

The old man gazed into the distance and fell into deep thought for a long while before saying slowly, "A sage’s thoughts should be thorough and meticulous. A gentleman’s words must be especially precise and detailed."

Chen Pingan was inspired and spoke out, "Cultivating strength, each punch and sword stroke should not miss the target, securing a foothold in reason. Cultivating the heart, only seeking the lofty, yet in the subtlety, one should inquire of their true self."

The old man did not comment on this.

The next moment, Chen Pingan found himself back in the cabin of the ferry.

He had been cast out into the void by Chen Chunan.

Bai Xi still stood in place.

In such a vast world, what could a mere Nascent Soul cultivator like him do? Even without obstruction, could he abandon the ferry to hide in the vast ocean? Or would he desperately rush to the Mountain Water Cave in Fuyun continent?

A Hidden Official, four sword immortals, and on top of that, the top figure of Southern Posa, Chen Chunan.

Bai Xi felt that even if he were in the Sword Qi Great Wall, he wouldn't necessarily survive among the wild realm's forces.

Chen Pingan smiled and asked, "Master Bai, how much time has passed?"

Bai Xi, seemingly ignoring the question, immediately said, "Lord Hidden Official, I am willing to atone for my mistakes! As long as I can live, I’ll do anything! I can testify against my ancestor’s collusion with the demon clans! I know all the resources of the Mountain Water Cave; I can offer them all to support the Sword Qi Great Wall…"

Chen Pingan lightly took a seat and interrupted him with a smile, "No need to rush. Everything can be set aside for the sake of the Hidden Official’s coin; let’s sit down and chat. There’s no hurry on how to make amends. Are you considering taking risks to capture me as a hostage, betting on the slim chance that the Hidden Official's realm is not high enough, so you can avoid the urgency?"

Bai Xi was drenched in sweat, his movements stiff, his expression dazed as he collapsed into a chair.

"Master Bai, that’s truly going too far."

Chen Pingan smiled, "If we’re talking about acting, you and I are kindred spirits. It’s a pity that you’re older but lack cultivation. You can compare your heart’s darkness, your realm, your resources, and everything else, but don’t ever compare this with me."

Suddenly, Bai Xi stood, his chair flying backward. As a Nascent Soul, he retreated a few steps and knelt, beginning to bow his head. "Lord Hidden Official, please save me!"

This was because the young Hidden Official was no longer alone; behind him stood the suddenly manifesting jade purity sword immortal, Mi Yu.

Chen Pingan poured himself a cup of tea, smiling as he asked, "Bring out your personal items, both private and from the sect, and remember to help me open them. If your sincerity is sufficient, I wouldn’t mind letting you gain something in this disaster, sitting in the first chair of the Mountain Water Cave. No matter my realm or background, you might still be confused, but you should be very clear about the kind of person I am; I always seek to maximize profit. This is your last chance, so cherish it."

After half a cup of tea, on the table before the young Hidden Official lay an ancient inkstone resembling a treasure chest from the Mountain Water Cave, and a fragrant fan, which was a personal item of the ferry's steward, along with many valuable items and celestial coins.

Some secrets of the Mountain Water Cave were also partially revealed by Bai Xi, but of course, he wouldn’t spill everything.

Bai Xi was not foolish.

Chen Pingan was even less so.

He took out a jade bamboo fan, lightly fanning himself while signaling Mi Yu to collect the personal and private items. If there was a hidden danger, Mi Yu could handle it. Even if he couldn’t entirely manage it, a Hidden Official at the lower realms shouldn’t have to bear the brunt of it.

Then, leaning back, Chen Pingan asked, "What are you waiting for? Get rid of him. Is he meant to be kept around for drinks or meals?"

Both Bai Xi and Mi Yu were startled.

Then, the world shifted again quietly.

Mi Yu slashed down with his sword, and it was remarkably smooth, comparable to being in the Sword Qi Great Wall, showing no trace of the pressure from the small realm, while the old Nascent Soul cultivator became somewhat sluggish.

This contrast, combined with the vast disparity between a jade purity sword immortal and a Nascent Soul cultivator, left no room for doubt.

Mi Yu's sword cleaved Bai Xi’s body in two, and not only that, but also split his golden core and the Nascent Soul in half.

However, just as Mi Yu was about to strike again, the young Hidden Official intervened, using a secret technique he had obtained from a business deal with Liu Zhimo at the Shujian Lake to bind the remnants of Bai Xi’s soul, gathering it in his palm while smiling, "If you ask me to save you, I will, so are you happy? What will your gratitude be?"

The suffering soul, barely able to hold back its cries, trembled and said, "Lord Hidden Official, you just need to speak; just make your request…"

Chen Pingan smiled and said, "I told you to be sincere, but you didn’t listen? What’s the outcome? Not very good, right? I’ll give you another chance; tell me the true secrets of the Mountain Water Cave, and you can live. You’re too high in realm for me to trust you as the next leader of the Mountain Water Cave. Right now, it’s perfect; your cultivation is so low that when you see me in the future, you’ll have to rely on celestial coins to get by."

The soul no longer dared to hide anything and revealed all the secret dealings of the Mountain Water Cave’s ancestor, as well as the infamous saying of "a cunning rabbit has three burrows, and treasures are scattered."

"Thank me with your death."

Chen Pingan nodded, clenched his fist, and crushed the frail soul with his strength. He then closed his folding fan and gently waved it to disperse the ethereal ashes of the soul, holding it to his chest, smiling, "Unexpected, isn’t it?"

Mi Yu was no longer surprised.

Chen Pingan stood, sheathing his folding fan, asking, "How much longer do you think Lu Zhi will take to slay that falsely titled ascendant demon? And is there any possibility of asking about the demon’s true form?"

Mi Yu looked troubled.

Who should he ask? Lu Zhi? She would hardly care to listen to him. Chen Chunan? Mi Yu didn’t have the face to do so.

Chen Pingan sighed, "Mi Yu, you really need to be more observant."

Mi Yu felt wronged.

Then Mi Yu’s curiosity piqued further; he surveyed his surroundings, noticing some signs. The sword cultivator at the upper fifth realm was indeed a sword immortal, and his insight was quite keen.

Was this the Hidden Official's personal flying sword?!

Chen Pingan retracted his personal flying sword, walking to the window.

Mi Yu sheathed his sword, standing guard nearby.

In the realm of sun and moon, the female sword immortal Lu Zhi battled fiercely with the ascendant demon.

In the cage-like small realm, Mi Yu had slain the Nascent Soul Bai Xi, and his soul was once again captured by Chen Pingan using a secret technique, then crushed with his fist.

The other qi cultivators aboard the Wapan ferry remained blissfully unaware of the unusual events happening around them.

Afterward.

The Wapan ferry continued its journey to Fuyun continent’s Mountain Water Cave, but it was now without a sneaky ascendant demon and with the boatmaster Bai Xi dead.

Lu Zhi joined them, while Chen Chunan did not accompany them but handed Lu Zhi a Confucian jade pendant.

Shao Yunyan was responsible for helping Lu Zhi deal with the aftermath of the Mountain Water Cave's chaos.

Though the chaos was indeed chaotic, the celestial coins were plentiful.

Shao Jianxian’s Spring Fan Studio could nominally receive a ten percent share.

However, the entire Spring Fan Studio had become the "private property" of the Hidden Official lineage, and even Shao Yunyan could not understand what that ten percent share really meant.

As for how to deal with the Mountain Water Cave, Chen Pingan had already clarified all the steps to Lu Zhi and Shao Yunyan.

Lu Zhi listened absentmindedly; anyway, with Shao Yunyan around, she planned to go into closed-door cultivation for a short while once she arrived at Fuyun continent.

She disliked these calculations of human hearts and was not skilled in them.

As for Xie Songhua, she would return to the Jiang Gaotai ferry to head to Aiai continent.

Before they parted ways, the young Hidden Official couldn’t help but chatter about the two children, prompting Xie Songhua to angrily ask if those two kids were their daughters.

Only then did the young Hidden Official fall silent.

Mi Yu found it amusing but dared not show it.

After all, people who could make the Hidden Official suffer were few and far between.

Chen Pingan and Mi Yu then boarded a talisman boat to return to the Inverted Mountain.

Chen Pingan stood at the bow of the ferry, glancing back at Mi Yu.

Sitting lazily at the stern, Mi Yu suddenly felt uneasy, wondering if another burden was about to fall on his shoulders.

Come, come, as long as Mi Da Jianxian furrows a brow, he won’t be the leader of the Hidden Official lineage!

Chen Pingan laughed, "After all the hustle and bustle, Shao Jianxian reaped a ten percent share of the Mountain Water Cave, Xie Jianxian repaid her favor, Lu Da Jianxian gained benefits in swordsmanship, along with that ascendant demon’s essence, and our Mi Jianxian’s sword quality has also improved. The personal and private items are also the collective gain of our Hidden Official lineage. It seems I’m the only one who has been running around for nothing?"

Mi Yu replied seriously, "Lord Hidden Official’s strategic planning and slaying of the ascendant demon is the foremost achievement, utterly deserved…"

Chen Pingan interrupted Mi Yu, clicking his tongue, "With your meager skills in flattery, if you were to go to my hometown, you wouldn’t even qualify as a named disciple, let alone a disciple."

Mi Yu felt heartbroken.

He had never been good at this; his path always relied on genuine feelings exchanged with beautiful women.

However, Mi Yu quickly made a feeble attempt to salvage, saying, "When I get there, you can just let me host the various fairies visiting the mountain. If there’s any slip-up, feel free to hold me accountable, Lord Hidden Official."

Chen Pingan smiled thinly, "Stay far away. The atmosphere in my mountain is already quite bizarre; even I, the mountain lord, can’t seem to reel it back in. With you around, wouldn’t your reputation go through the roof?"

Mi Yu felt utterly wronged.

After a moment of hesitation, he asked curiously, "Lord Hidden Official, why did you not accept the demon core that Lu Zhi offered? She truly didn’t want to keep it. According to the merit calculations of the Hidden Official lineage, this item should rightfully belong to you."

Chen Pingan sat down, gazing at the vast and boundless scenery of the rippling waters. "It’s not that I didn’t accept it; I did, but I asked Lu Zhi to pass it on to a friend in Southern Posa."

Mi Yu exclaimed, "Oh," suddenly realizing that obtaining an ascendant demon's core in the majestic realm was equivalent to acquiring a jade purity cultivator's glazed golden body? 

And this was called "nothing to worry about"?

Chen Pingan lightly tapped his palm with the closed fan, turning his head with a smile, "Hmm?"

Mi Yu immediately exclaimed, "Lord Hidden Official, you’re so selfless! You truly are a celestial among mortals. In all the tales of talented scholars and beautiful women, all the stories of supernatural beings and strange occurrences should replace 'the exiled immortal' with 'Chen Pingan.'"

Mi Yu felt he was gradually coming into his own; although he still did not dare to battle with Guo Zhujiu, the Hidden Official’s direct disciple, he should now be able to compete with Gu Jianlong on this matter.

Chen Pingan turned back, continuing to gaze ahead, and after a long silence, he suddenly said, "Mi Yu, I’m happy that we’ve turned from strangers into friends."

Mi Yu was taken aback for a moment, then finally nodded, "It’s an honor to meet Chen Pingan."

After a moment, Chen Pingan asked, "As a parting gift, what did you write on the folding fan you gave to that female Nascent Soul cultivator from the Central Land?"

Mi Yu’s smile became awkward. "Such trivial romantic sentiments would only make the Hidden Official laugh at me; it’s better not to mention it."

Chen Pingan insisted, "Tell me."

When it came to dealing with women, Mi Yu’s cultivation level was quite impressive.

Mi Yu hesitated, "Then I’ll truly be embarrassing myself?"

After all, this young Hidden Official had once been the shopkeeper, overseeing the records of the Hundred Sword Immortal and the Bi Sword Immortal, along with a plethora of fan inscriptions. Mi Yu was likely the most dedicated sword immortal in the Sword Qi Great Wall, diligently researching numerous ways, especially the fan inscriptions that delighted women. He had inquired about them and copied them down, studying them thoroughly, and felt he had gained immensely.

Deep down, Mi Yu also believed that his fan inscriptions should at least have the skill level of a shopkeeper.

Since they were on the ferry with no outsiders around, he figured it was a good opportunity to share without losing face.

On one side of the fan, he had written, "Pity the one before my eyes, yet I smell the osmanthus. I surely grow thin from this, as the shame belongs to my lord."

On the other side, he inscribed, "Walking, I think of you; sitting, I think of you; not being able to walk, sitting is difficult. Missing you, not seeing you, I drink and laugh; how few are the days of life."

Chen Pingan remained silent for a long time after hearing this.

Finally, he couldn’t help but shout, "Get out and fly your sword!"

He genuinely felt that in the realm of love and romance, where talent was more important than cultivation, he would never catch up to Mi Yu’s shadow.

The wronged Mi Yu had no choice but to get up, disgruntled, as he obediently left the talisman boat and began to fly away in the distance.

Upon reaching the Inverted Mountain, he first visited the Spring Fan Studio. This residence was unique among the four private residences because it was entirely a refined item. From its construction, Shao Yunyan had set up numerous formations and talismans, which meant that from the very beginning, the Spring Fan Studio had not truly settled within the largest mountain seal of this realm. In contrast, the more resource-consuming Yuan Rou Mansion had not considered this, while the Meihua Garden had no chance of being refined.

Shao Yunyan handed over a crucial treasure that served as the core of the great formation to Chen Pingan.

After confirming the details, Chen Pingan departed with Mi Yu from the Spring Fan Studio.

Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan stayed behind in the residence, responsible for receiving other ferry managers arriving from the eight continents.

Mi Yu would also remain, but he still needed to escort Chen Pingan to the connecting gates between the two great realms, curiously asking, "Why don’t we use the old gate closer to the Spring Fan Studio? The elder Zhang Lu stationed there and that book-loving little Taoist boy seem quite interesting."

Chen Pingan merely replied with a noncommittal "Mm," without further explanation.

Mi Yu had only asked casually, and he didn’t think much of it.

After sending the Hidden Official to the gate, Mi Yu needed to return to the Spring Fan Studio. He was familiar with many of the female boatmasters and ferry cultivators; unfortunately, they were all acquaintances without fate.

Upon entering the hall of the Summer Palace, everyone looked up.

Guo Zhujiu was the first to speak, "Master, how many ascendant demons did you slay this time?"

Chen Pingan, feeling somewhat fatigued, sat on the threshold, "Just one."

Guo Zhujiu blinked, "There really was one? Master, I don’t know how to explain the next part!"

The sword immortal Chou Miao looked toward Chen Pingan.

Chen Pingan nodded and smiled, "There really was."

Chou Miao clasped his fists but didn’t say anything.

The first group of three sword cultivators who had gone out to slay from the city wall—Chou Miao, Dong Budie, and Deng Liang—had already returned.

Since Mi Yu had gone with Chen Pingan to the Spring Fan Studio, only Pang Yuanji and Lin Junbi had gone out to fight.

Chen Pingan said, "It’s not as comfortable here; I’ll take a little break, so you all carry on."

The people in the room busied themselves once more.

Even Guo Zhujiu, who was usually persistent, refrained from seeking out her master for a chat.

Now, the Hidden Official lineage was gradually forming several small factions.

Lin Junbi and Pang Yuanji got along well. Pang Yuanji was less spirited lately, doing tasks or occasionally playing chess with Lin Junbi, seeking guidance.

Pang Yuanji learned chess quickly. Outside the chessboard, Lin Junbi was growing rapidly, and all the other members of the Hidden Official lineage noticed and paid attention.

The foreign sword cultivator Song Gaoyuan got along well with Luo Zhenyi, Xu Ning, and Chang Taiqing.

Deng Liang enjoyed chatting with Dong Budie every few days; even the blind could tell that this former wild cultivator, who had eventually ascended to the sect's roster as a Nascent Soul sword cultivator, had his aspirations.

However, it was evident that Dong Budie had no interest in Deng Liang, and anyone could see it.

Privately, Chen Pingan had once joked with Deng Liang, saying, "I’m a good brother of Chen Sanqiu; if you keep this up, I’ll pull Chen Sanqiu into the Hidden Official lineage."

Deng Liang laughed, saying it was fine, "I’m a Nascent Soul sword cultivator; that young master Chen is still at the Golden Core bottleneck. As long as the Hidden Official doesn’t show favoritism, I guarantee he’ll come in standing tall and leave horizontally."

Then Deng Liang added, "Even without discussing realms, just in terms of drinking, young master Chen is no match for me."

Gu Jianlong, Wang Xinshui, along with Cao Gun and Xuan Can, formed a cohesive group of four guardians, progressing and retreating together, and they particularly liked to follow Guo Zhujiu’s lead. Whenever Guo Zhujiu employed the sect's absolute skill, the remaining four would follow suit.

Ultimately, these four young individuals were those closest to the Hidden Official and could be shameless.

Today was an exception; in truth, the achievement of slaying a hidden ascendant demon was so shocking that Gu Jianlong and the others dared not speak.

Lin Junbi and Xuan Can were both masters of chess, often playing together.

Chen Pingan would also assist Xuan Can in strategizing. Xuan Can, being somewhat forgetful, often suffered defeat despite having received the Hidden Official’s guidance repeatedly.

Guo Zhujiu would complain about why Xuan Can couldn’t keep up with her master’s thoughts, wasting the Hidden Official’s golden advice that could secure victory.

Gu Jianlong and Wang Xinshui, not understanding chess, preferred to make a ruckus. One would cheer for Xuan Can, while the other would chatter about Lin Junbi, calling it a strategy of psychological warfare.

Pang Yuanji often sought a quiet spot in the Summer Palace to daydream alone.

Chou Miao would offer sword technique guidance to all the younger cultivators, including Deng Liang and Song Gaoyuan, as long as they were willing to ask. As a sword immortal, Chou Miao was always willing to teach patiently.

Dong Budie would occasionally drag Luo Zhenyi along to discuss female matters; originally, Luo Zhenyi, who often maintained a serious demeanor, now displayed a hint of gentleness in her brows and eyes.

Guo Zhujiu was the least factional among them; she could ask Chou Miao for sword skills, chat with Pang Yuanji, and preferred to join Dong Budie and Luo Zhenyi, engaging in lively discussions, leading to countless amusing incidents, from bumping heads on tables to hitting walls, ending with no exception.

Chen Pingan viewed all this as a good thing.

A person’s state of mind cannot always be tense; it requires a balance of relaxation to endure.

Within the Hidden Official lineage, while everyone performed their roles, they complemented one another, without missing gaps, pooling strengths to make up for shortcomings. They had already established a structured approach, making headway.

Chen Pingan no longer expected these sword cultivators to do better, but he thought, as the Hidden Official, sometimes, one still had to act like a villain.

If it came to the craft of speaking in veiled tones, using pretty words to convey sharp-edged content, Chen Pingan was truly the master, far surpassing the skilled Gu Jianlong.

Of course, this was predicated on hitting the mark; otherwise, if one only ridiculed, it would backfire.

Chen Pingan recalled something and tossed the personal and private items obtained from the Mountain Water Cave's Wapan ferry to Guo Zhujiu, smiling, "This is extra profit."

Then Chen Pingan detailed the entire process of this journey, glossing over what couldn’t be disclosed. For instance, how he had drawn out many of the Mountain Water Cave’s secrets from a Nascent Soul boatmaster, and how he had ensured the killing while preserving the inkstone and fan, specifically knowing how to open the doors.

Guo Zhujiu cleared her table, her eyes shining as she spat into her palm and rubbed her hands together, then began to count the celestial treasures and the pile of celestial coins within the personal and private items.

Dong Budie laughed, "Lord Hidden Official, are you telling us that you have a personal item called the treasure pot?"

Earlier, during their return to the Summer Palace, they had brought back over one hundred celestial treasures from the Spring Fan Studio.

This time, leaving the Inverted Mountain, they brought back two treasures from the mountain, along with a hefty amount of wealth hidden within.

Guo Zhujiu, without looking up, huffed, "It’s only because my master is righteous and deliberately refrained from using his powers; otherwise, if he were to travel to Southern Posa today and then to Central Land tomorrow, he could have dragged back mountains of gold and silver."

Chen Pingan laughed, "Gold and silver can’t be moved, but I did bring you a worthless snowball. You can handle your tasks first; later, we can make a few smaller snowmen."

From his personal items, Chen Pingan took out the large snowball.

In other places of the Sword Qi Great Wall, snowballs were hard to keep, but in the Summer Palace, if placed under the big tree, it would likely last for several days without concern.

Guo Zhujiu was overjoyed, "Master, you’re giving me a gift?! Luckily, the senior sister can’t see this; otherwise, she might want to swap with me for senior sister and junior sister!"

Chen Pingan’s expression softened with a smile, "Take care; your senior sister holds grudges. Her little ledger is something I don’t even get to see."

Guo Zhujiu sat down, swaying her shoulders left and right, mimicking her senior sister, feeling incredibly joyful, at a loss for words.

Without a small gong or drum nearby, she felt a twinge of regret.

Then everyone in the room saw the young Hidden Official, bending over with his back to them, starting to build a small snowman in the sweltering summer heat of the Summer Palace.

Chen Pingan suddenly said, "Regarding the ascendant demon 'Border,' do not hold any grievances against Lin Junbi; he has nothing to do with this. The other party is scheming to become Lin Junbi’s senior brother, which has great implications."

Chou Miao laughed, "We were all waiting for Lord Hidden Official to say this."

Indeed, many people breathed a sigh of relief.

Chen Pingan continued, "By the way, the treasures from the Mountain Water Cave, we Hidden Official lineage will not be splitting the spoils."

A hush fell over the room.

Guo Zhujiu clapped her hands on the table, shouting that it was outrageous, effectively being the only one to defend the Hidden Official.

Gu Jianlong and Wang Xinshui were the loudest, whistling vigorously.

Even Luo Zhenyi began to complain alongside Dong Budie.

Xuan Can and Cao Gun sighed deeply, lamenting that their meager and stingy lives were unbearable.

Chen Pingan laughed heartily, "It seems this truly has been lost."

Guo Zhujiu gleefully said, "You lot are all a bit dim-witted."

Chen Pingan waved his hand, "Come and take a look at the snowman I built."

Guo Zhujiu jumped up, quickly grabbed her small bamboo box, swaggering over the threshold, and plopped down. After a moment of astonished silence, she timidly asked, "Master, who is this? It’s my senior sister, right?"

The snowman had two slanted bamboo leaves stuck on its large head, striking a pose, holding a bamboo branch, appearing foolish and unrefined.

Chen Pingan smiled, "It's a gift for you; place it on the table."

Guo Zhujiu frowned thoughtfully.

She glanced at Dong Budie, who lifted a hand to gently press down on the table.

Guo Zhujiu had no choice but to hold the small snowman, obediently returning to her seat, following her master’s orders, placing the snowman on the table while turning it around, facing Dong Budie.

Chen Pingan clapped his hands and stood up.

He thought of the two children who had already been taken to Aiai continent by Xie Songhua; in the future, Wei Jin, Shao Yunyan, and all the sword immortals returning home from the Sword Qi Great Wall would bring along one or two young sword cultivators who were not yet high in realm.

Dandelions, drifting away with the wind to distant lands.

He hoped that these children from the Sword Qi Great Wall would one day become individuals like Liu Xianyang and Chen Pingan, journeying far from the Li Pearl Cave, and perhaps even live better and more prosperous lives.
