 ### Chapter 521: Entering the Mountains and Meeting an Old Friend (Part 1)

The small town had no nighttime curfew. Under the cover of night, Chen Ping'an left Mud Bottle Alley, took a slight detour, and led his horse toward the Yang Family Shop.

After knocking, a drowsy young boy opened the door. He was likely the new disciple that Wei Ban mentioned in his letter—a young apprentice of Old Yang.

Chen Ping'an smiled apologetically. "Is your master asleep?"

The boy yawned and countered, "What do you think?"

Chen Ping'an found himself at a loss for words. Having grown accustomed to the cunning and wordplay from the area around Book Letter Lake, he was momentarily out of his depth.

The boy frowned and asked, "What do you want with my master? Are you sick?"

Chen Ping'an couldn't help but chuckle wryly, pausing for a moment before nodding. "I did come to see him about a sickness."

The boy frowned harder, looking conflicted.

Under the moonlight, the young man before him had slightly sunken cheeks and a haggard look, resembling someone who might meet an early demise. His accent was local, but he was unfamiliar.

It seemed unlikely that his master would make an appearance tonight, especially after the ruckus that had occurred previously. The Yang Family Shop's reputation and business had taken a hit, earning the ire of many neighbors. Nowadays, people preferred to visit a pharmacy in Mooncake Alley for their medicines. The boy and his senior sister spent their days idly, while their master, a peculiar old man who had a grudge against money, never cared about the shop's decline. His family had suggested he change careers, perhaps to work at the kiln supervision bureau, and his uncle had even paved the way, but he was reluctant. He found the idea of dealing with officials tiresome, having to bow and scrape just to get by.

Realizing Old Yang had no intention of coming out, Chen Ping'an considered returning another time. Just as he was about to take his leave, a graceful young woman emerged from inside. Her skin was slightly dark and she was slender, but she was undoubtedly beautiful. Chen Ping'an recognized her as one of Old Yang's disciples, the senior sister of the boy from Peach Leaf Alley. She came from a family of kiln workers in Dragon Riding Alley, where there were many strict rules about kiln work. For instance, when the kiln fire was lit, women were not allowed near the dragon kilns that resembled sleeping dragons. Chen Ping'an was unsure how she had become a kiln worker, but it was likely she had been forced into hard labor, as the traditions had been upheld through generations, with everyone adhering to them. Compared to the strict regulations governing cultivators on the mountains, these seemed even more effective.

The woman spoke, her voice rough and hoarse like a grinding stone. "Master said he can't help. From now on, you can reminisce, but no business transactions."

Chen Ping'an nodded and smiled. "Please tell your master I'll visit again."

The woman hesitated for a moment, glancing at the long sword on Chen Ping'an's back. "Is the guest a pure martial artist?"

Chen Ping'an asked, "Are you one, too?"

The woman fell silent.

He then inquired, "Where does Zheng Dafeng live now?"

Only then did she respond, "He likes to wander around the county city and doesn't come to the shop often."

Chen Ping'an glanced at her and the drowsy boy behind her, smiling as he led his horse away.

The two locals likely still had no idea who their master really was. The Yang Family Shop had hosted countless saints from the Three Teachings, and recognizing Old Yang as their master carried significant weight. 

Did anyone ever view him this way in the past?

As the boy closed the shop door, he complained to his unmoving senior sister, "I don't like that gloomy guy. His gaze is so cold."

Having suffered through poverty and hardship in her youth, the girl had only recently attained a figure resembling an ordinary town girl. She was not good with words and rarely smiled, so she remained silent, watching the figure of the man leading the horse fade into the distance.

She was the boy's senior sister, steady in demeanor, and had thus been exposed to their master's prowess early on. In less than three years, she had already become a fourth-tier pure martial artist. However, to break through the difficult third-tier bottleneck, she would rather endure excruciating pain than swallow the medicinal ointment from the porcelain jar. Only after enduring that trial had she managed to surpass the hurdle. Her master was indifferent, merely sitting and puffing smoke, not even casting her a glance, lost in his own thoughts.

After struggling to sit up, covered in blood, she had buried her face in her hands, weeping tears of joy. Old sayings about surviving great trials bearing future blessings were not wrong.

Glancing at his disciple who had survived calamity, the old man, leaning against the steps and tapping his pipe, finally spoke. "Your temperament and resilience are probably only half of someone else's. Should that make you happy? That person is only a few years older than you, also a kiln apprentice, and more helpless back then, relying solely on himself. Breaking through to the third tier in three years is impressive, is it? With such limited potential, do you think you can snatch the remaining mountain peak realms in Baopingzhou? I have a suggestion: next time he scatters the martial fortune gifts, just hold out a bowl and kneel to catch what he discards. If you can't even compare to him, how can you ask who Cao Ci from Zheng Dafu is? Young and shameless, I seem to have picked up a good disciple. Should I go to your effeminate uncle's grave, offer a toast, and say thanks?"

When the master spoke, his words could pierce the heart. 

She was like this, and her junior brother, Shi Ling Shan, was not much better. The only difference was that her brother dared to grumble behind closed doors, while she did not.

Chen Ping'an arrived at the edge of the small town, where Li Huai's residence was nearby. He paused for a moment, then left the alley and mounted his horse, heading first to the nearest small hill—the Pearl Mountain he had bought for a single gold coin back then. 

Riding to the hilltop, he gazed down at the town. In the deep of night, only a few lights flickered in the distance—Fulu Street, Peach Leaf Alley, the county office, and the kiln supervision bureau. If he turned to look northwest toward the new county city, nestled among the northern mountains, thousands of lights gathered, casting a faint yellow glow across the night sky. One could imagine the bustling life there; it must be a scene of brightness as vibrant as day.

Pearl Mountain was the smallest peak among the western mountains, so small that it was almost negligible. The reason Chen Ping'an had purchased it was simple: it was cheap, and nothing else complicated his thoughts.

At that time, he had considered building a cottage on Pearl Mountain, making it convenient to visit the town, just a few steps away. Traveling back and forth between Pearl Mountain and Mud Bottle Alley was not a burden even on foot.

Sitting on his horse, Chen Ping'an’s gaze swept back over the outline of the town shrouded in night. He recalled a path that led into the mountains. In his childhood, he had once carried a large basket into the mountains to gather herbs, stumbling along the way. In the scorching summer, the ropes from the basket had chafed his shoulders painfully. He had felt as if he was carrying the weight of his ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley. That was the first time in his life he had wanted to give up, convincing himself with a very reasonable excuse: you’re still young, too weak; gathering herbs could wait until tomorrow. All he needed to do was get up early and head into the mountains at dawn, avoiding the heat of the midday sun. Along the way, he hadn’t seen any strong young men working in the fields…

Chen Ping'an sighed softly, turning his horse's head and descending Pearl Mountain.

Now, entering the mountains, the road was smooth and wide, connecting the peaks, no longer the rugged path of the past.

The mountains stretched endlessly, and even though a road had been opened, reaching Luopo Mountain, located in the southern part of the mountain range, still required a considerable amount of time. Given that Chen Ping'an walked slowly, seemingly wanting to take in the scenery of each mountain along the way, he frequently stopped to admire the view or led his horse along leisurely. By the time Chen Ping'an reached the territory of Luopo Mountain, it was already a day and a night later, and that was with the superior endurance of his horse, Qu Huang.

When riding, Chen Ping'an would occasionally lightly squeeze the horse's belly, and Qu Huang would understand, increasing its pace, leaving a trail of hoof prints on the ground. Then Chen Ping'an would glance back.

Over the years, he often did this, finding small amusements in boredom, both a way to find joy in hardship and to steal moments of leisure amidst busyness.

Most of the time, the reticent accountant would be seen in the eyes of Wu Ye and Gu Can, often engaging in these peculiar little activities.

He would crouch down and draw a chessboard in the dirt with pebbles, or study a few Go patterns back and forth, or play a game of Five in a Row against himself.

Just one person and one horse, gradually delving deeper into the mountains.

It was likely Wei Ban, the first to sense Chen Ping'an's movements, who had yet to reveal himself.

It should be noted that not only was Longquan County under the jurisdiction of the Longxu River and Tiefu River basins, but even the areas around Xiuhuai River and the residence of the Bride Ghost with its "Hanging High Wind" plaque belonged to the territory of Beiyue. Wei Ban, high atop Piyun Mountain, looked down upon the world, especially those practicing Qi cultivation, with clarity.

However, Wei Ban's delay in appearing was both unexpected and reasonable.

In their early years, their relationship had not been deep; it had initially relied on a mutual acquaintance. Over time, they had gradually become friends, sharing a bond akin to "gentlemanly friendship." Wei Ban could take it upon himself to lead Chen Ping'an on "inspections" around the territory of Beiyue, helping him obtain a protective talisman from the Beiyue Mountain Temple. But now, as their ties had deepened, leaning toward an ally relationship, they needed to exercise caution. Even superficial appearances mattered; otherwise, the court of Great Li might feel displeased. After all, Wei Ban was the first of the Five Sacred Peaks revered by their dynasty. How could he collaborate with others in business, then chop prices mercilessly in front of the Song family of Great Li? Even if Wei Ban was willing to disregard the Song family's reputation, taking advantage of his already secured status as a mountain deity would be audacious and greedy. Chen Ping'an didn't dare accept such a proposal; a night of sudden wealth was no match for a long-lasting friendship, which was obviously more prudent.

Moreover, Wei Ban was always thoughtful and calculated, making him trustworthy.

Otherwise, Chen Ping'an wouldn't have sent so many letters to Piyun Mountain over the years.

At dawn, he finally reached the foot of Luopo Mountain.

The mountain gate was built with an archway, though it lacked a plaque. According to tradition, there should have been a plaque for the mountain deity at the peak of Luopo Mountain. However, the mountain deity, who had come from the kiln supervision bureau, had fallen on hard times. Not only was Luopo Mountain "dependent on others" as the foundation of Chen Ping'an's family business, but his relationship with Wei Ban was also quite strained. Additionally, a profound martial arts master resided in the bamboo house nearby, along with a large black python that often slithered around Luopo Mountain. In the past, Li Xisheng had written talismanic characters on the bamboo house's walls with a small snow cone, which caused Luopo Mountain to lose some of its charm. Consequently, the Luopo Mountain Temple became the least frequented of the three mountain temples in Longquan County. The mountain god enshrined there, who had received a golden statue posthumously, was truly unpopular.

Wei Ban slowly descended the mountain, with Shi Rou following behind at a distance.

 ### Chapter 522: Entering the Mountain and Reuniting with Old Friends (Part 2)

Chen Ping'an dismounted from his horse and smiled as he asked, "What about Pei Qian and the others?"

Wei Ban, with a hint of mischief in his tone, replied, "I deliberately didn’t tell them your whereabouts. Those three little rascals still think their master and teacher are returning from Hongzhu Town to Longquan County and are probably waiting anxiously for you right now. As for Zhu Lian, he’s been wandering around the county city these past few days, claiming to have found a promising martial arts candidate. He’s not sure if they can reach the Golden Body Realm, but he wants to present them to his young master as a good omen upon returning home."

Walking side by side with Wei Ban, Chen Ping'an noticed that Shi Rou was still following them from a distance. They exchanged a nod as a form of greeting.

Feeling slightly apologetic, Chen Ping'an said, "I’m really sorry for the delay regarding the mountain purchase."

Wei Ban, clad in white and moving gracefully along the mountain path like a spirit gliding over water, smiled and said, "Actually, at the end of Year Eleven in Yongjia, this deal almost fell through. The Da Li court argued that the Niujiao Mountain ferry should not be sold to cultivators but should instead be handed over to the Da Li military. They clearly indicated signs of wanting to back out. At most, they would sell you one or two inconsequential hills as a form of compensation, and I would have no choice but to concede. However, as the year-end approached, the Da Li Ministry of Rites temporarily shelved the matter. After the New Year, once the officials were done with their festivities and had their fill, they returned to Longquan County and suddenly changed their tune, saying we could wait a bit longer. I figured you must have successfully wrapped things up at Shujian Lake."

Chen Ping'an forced a smile, "Not at all."

Wei Ban turned to look at Chen Ping'an's current appearance and burst out laughing. "You can definitely tell. You look a bit better than the average person transitioning into the divine path during the 'Flesh Disintegration and Bone Establishment' phase, but it’s still quite tragic. When Pei Qian sees you, they’ll probably not recognize you."

Scratching his head, Chen Ping'an sighed, "Even if the mountain purchase goes through, I still have a mountain of debt at Shujian Lake."

Wei Ban chuckled, "In the end, it’s just a headache over money, which is better than the initial turmoil of your mind, filled with self-blame and confusion, right?"

Chen Ping'an smiled broadly and nodded, "That makes sense."

Suddenly, Wei Ban said, "I don’t have any money to lend you, being just an empty shell of a deity from Beiyue. However, if you can trick some heavenly money out of it, feel free to take it. If you make a profit, that’s your skill."

Chen Ping'an rubbed his hands together, grinning, "I wouldn’t dare!"

Wei Ban was taken aback. The tone didn’t sound like the Chen Ping'an of years gone by. It seemed that if he wasn’t careful, this guy would take advantage of the situation and really try to earn money under the banner of the Beiyue deity. Wei Ban quickly patted Chen Ping'an’s shoulder and said with a smile, "If you feel embarrassed, that’s fine. I won’t let you feel awkward; we’re friends, after all, and should understand each other..."

Shi Rou followed them from a distance. To be honest, she was quite shocked when she first saw Chen Ping'an at the entrance of Luopu Mountain. 

He had changed so much in just a few years.

Was it because he had lost Sui Youbian, Lu Baixiang, Wei Xian, and Zhu Lian by his side, leaving him to face the chaos of Shujian Lake alone, exposing the true nature of that wild place? Was he just content to have survived the notorious area of Baoping Zhou? Shi Rou didn’t underestimate Chen Ping'an, though. After all, through conversations with Zhu Lian and the mountain deity Wei Ban over the years, she had gained some understanding of the inner workings at Shujian Lake. She knew that even with Zhu Lian by his side, Chen Ping'an wouldn’t be able to carve a bloody path out of that chaos. After all, a single True Monarch Liu Zhimiao was enough to make all outsiders tremble, not to mention Liu Lao Cheng’s return to Shujian Lake as the only wild cultivator in the Fifth Realm of Baoping Zhou.

Chen Ping'an said, "Tell Pei Qian and the others not to sit around waiting in Hongzhu Town."

Wei Ban chuckled knowingly, nodding as he whistled and said, "Let’s hurry back; Chen Ping'an is already at Luopu Mountain."

Like a leaf floating on a stream, they spun and vanished.

Nearby in Hongzhu Town, on the eaves of a roof, Wei Ban's familiar voice rang out beside Pei Qian and the others.

Pei Qian, resting his chin on his hand, widened his eyes, "Is that true?"

The boy in the green outfit, lounging on the rooftop and soaking up the sun, rubbed his chin and said, "I think Wei Ban is just messing with us. He’s just bored and playing tricks."

The girl in the pink dress sitting next to Pei Qian softly said, "Mr. Wei probably wouldn’t joke about something like this, would he?"

Pei Qian suddenly stood up, fists clenched, and lightly bumped them together. "My master is really elusive! He sneaks up on us without a sound. Isn’t that impressive?!"

The girl in pink giggled, covering her mouth.

The boy in green retorted, "Impressive my foot! We’ve been waiting here for days! Just wait until I see him; I’m going to ask him for my red envelope. If it’s even one short, I’ll be furious with Chen Ping'an!"

Pei Qian turned to the boy in green, placing one hand on the hilt of the sword hanging at his waist. With a serious tone, he said, "Friends are friends, but the master is the greatest. If you keep trying to take advantage of my master, I might just take your head!"

His words were quite mature for his age, reflecting Pei Qian’s usual style.

Perhaps due to their youth, they enjoyed boasting and saying strange things, making it hard to tell which of Pei Qian’s words were sincere and which were just playful banter.

The boy in green rolled his eyes, "You think you can do that with your meager skills?"

Pei Qian shook his head, "I’m familiar with the old chef. If I ask him to deal with you, I’ll take your head without hesitation."

The girl in pink felt a bit anxious, fearing that these two would get into a real fight.

Though they often bickered, they had never really fought. Instead, they liked to "debate," competing on who could come up with the most impressive martial arts techniques and methods.

The boy in green considered the weight of a distant traveler and the relationship between Pei Qian and the old chef, along with Wei Ban's discerning eye, which seemed to regard Pei Qian with newfound respect. Feeling distressed, he jumped up and forced a smile, "Heroine Pei, why are you so serious? Chen Ping'an is your master, but he’s also our lord! We’re all family here, so let’s keep the peace. What’s with the talk about heads? Besides, I’m not a dog! I’m a big jiao dragon who has been patted on the shoulder by the Three Teaching Masters of Daoism multiple times. In our Lijudongtian and Longquan County, who dares? With my heroism, you should respect me a bit more and not say such hurtful things!"

Pei Qian replied earnestly, "I’m not joking with you. We, as people of the martial world, keep our word!"

The boy in green grinned, "Got it, got it."

The girl in pink sighed in relief.

Luckily, they didn’t fall out. Otherwise, she wouldn’t know how to mediate.

The three of them flitted from rooftop to rooftop in Hongzhu Town, quickly leaving the small town and entering the mountains. A massive black serpent, coiling in an uninhabited area, slithered out, leaving deep tracks in its wake, a sight to behold. Pei Qian leaped onto the head of the black serpent first, sitting cross-legged and laying his bamboo sword across his knees.

The girl in pink settled in the middle of the serpent’s back.

The boy in green stood on the serpent’s tail, swaying back and forth. When he glanced at the slender figure of the black-haired girl ahead, a sense of unease filled his heart. In that fleeting moment, he felt the innate pressure she exuded.

This uncomfortable feeling was something he struggled to adapt to.

The first time he noticed something different about Pei Qian was in the mountains when they were chasing after a wild dog that had become clever. Pei Qian was covered in grass and leaves, with a few small scratches on her face from branches. Finally cornering the "wild dog," she didn’t even seem to notice her minor injuries, her eyes only focused on the trapped creature. With a gleam of determination, she pressed the hilt of her knife, slowly drawing it from its sheath, her posture low and her gaze fixed on the wild dog, becoming more fervent with each inch the bamboo sword emerged.

From that moment, the boy in green no longer regarded Pei Qian as an inexperienced girl.

He even found it puzzling why the upright Chen Ping'an would take such a peculiar disciple, especially one as his first disciple.

The black serpent from Qizhu Mountain was extremely familiar with the path back home.

Pei Qian, along with the boy in green and the girl in pink, all had their own thoughts.

Pei Qian lightly tapped the head of the black serpent with the bottom of her sword sheath and frowned, "Don’t slack off! Hurry up, or one day when I master the Demon Sword Technique, I might just use you for practice."

The black serpent had no choice but to speed up.

Meanwhile, at Luopu Mountain...

Chen Ping'an returned to the bamboo tower, filled with mixed emotions.

Throughout the journey, Wei Ban and Chen Ping'an had discussed everything that needed to be talked about, and he used his innate divine ability to return to Piyun Mountain.

Shi Rou watched Chen Ping'an ascend to the second floor, hesitating for a moment before moving a bamboo chair to sit under the eaves. She was curious about the relationship between Chen Ping'an and the elderly man surnamed Cui.

The old man didn’t seem like a mere martial artist; he appeared more like a retired scholar living in the mountains. Wei Ban and Zhu Lian seemed to have an unspoken agreement not to say much in front of her, treating the old man as if he didn’t exist.

Initially, the old man intended to nurture Pei Qian. However, after a casual squeeze of her bones, she fell to the ground, crying and looking pitifully at him. The old man had a look as if he had stepped in dog waste by accident. Taking advantage of his momentary distraction, Pei Qian sneaked away, not approaching the bamboo tower for several days, wandering aimlessly in the mountains. Later, she simply left the western mountains and went to a pastry shop in Qilong Alley, becoming a small shopkeeper, determined to avoid the old man. After that, the old man completely gave up on Pei Qian. Occasionally, when standing on the second floor gazing at the scenery, he would cast a sidelong glance at her, feeling akin to seeing a young phoenix happily remaining in a chicken coop, which left him rather helpless.

Chen Ping'an knocked on the door and entered.

The elderly man was sitting cross-legged, opening his eyes to examine Chen Ping'an.

Chen Ping'an sat opposite the old man, carrying the sword of an immortal on his back and a sword nurturing gourd hanging from his waist.

The old man found the sword a bit bothersome, while the nurturing gourd seemed slightly better. "Relying on these external items, you managed to escape from that filthy place?" 

Chen Ping'an replied, "I can’t say it was just thanks to these, but without this sword, I truly wouldn’t have survived. At Shujian Lake, on Qingsha Island, I almost got killed by a Fifth Realm wild cultivator."

The old man scoffed, "If they genuinely wanted to kill you, it wouldn’t matter whether you had that sword or not."

Chen Ping'an said, "In situations where killing is an option or not, not having this sword would increase the likelihood of being killed."

The old man frowned, displeased.

Chen Ping'an continued, "On the martial arts path, one should indeed pursue purity. However, if one deliberately places themselves in life-and-death situations for the sake of achieving perfect 'purity,' I believe that’s unwise. Even if one can navigate through peril once or twice, there will come a day when one encounters a hurdle they can’t overcome, and then death is inevitable. I think the purity of martial arts should first be found in one’s heart, even more so than the practitioners on the mountain. One must achieve a state of mind that is free from impurities; only then can they gradually remove the external distractions when they strike. This is the foundation of martial purity. Otherwise, the path of martial arts is already fraught with obstacles and challenges, with the specter of dead ends waiting ahead. If one continues to convince themselves that death is of no consequence, how will they ever go far?"

The old man leaned forward slightly, supporting himself with his fists on his knees, and coldly laughed, "What? After wandering outside for a few years, you think you’ve become capable enough to speak big words to me?"

As the old man leaned forward a bit, a torrent of martial intent surged into the room, crashing toward Chen Ping'an like a flood.

Even Shi Rou outside the bamboo tower sensed the overwhelming pressure, as if a dam was about to break.

Chen Ping'an remained seated, still and steadfast, matching his body and mind in this moment.

Inside, it felt as though a fierce gale was sweeping through.

Chen Ping'an slid backward repeatedly, yet he remained upright, even when his back pressed against the wall, he did not alter his posture in the slightest.

The old man sighed, a hint of pity in his eyes. "Chen Ping'an, have you become so afraid of death after just one trip to Shujian Lake? Are you not curious why you’ve been unable to break through the Fifth Realm bottleneck for so long? Do you truly believe it’s because you’re holding back? Or is it that you’re afraid to delve deeper?"

Chen Ping'an fell silent.

The old man looked at the young man, now frail and leaning against the wall. "Fear of death is simply fear of death; you just refuse to admit it. Of course, you have your reasons for fearing death, and I won’t mock you for it. However, the intriguing part of life lies here. Whether in martial arts or cultivation, regardless of whether your thoughts are reasonable or not, your reasoning may be correct, but unfortunately, you cannot persuade your true heart with what you believe is right. Your desire to practice swordsmanship has grown more and more intense. I speculate that in these years at Shujian Lake, you’ve often had fleeting thoughts that come and go without your awareness. You’ve seen the elegance of the sword cultivators, but you’ve never witnessed my true skill. However, you’ve walked along the Sword Qi Great Wall and seen more than one or two sword immortals."

Chen Ping'an hesitated, seeming to want to refute.

The old man laughed, "When I was feeding my punches, I had too many strikes, each measured. I smoothed your Third Realm martial path, so although you certainly suffered many torments, the journey has been... smooth. This is naturally my prowess; I didn’t injure your body or taint your heart in the slightest. But the elegance of the sword immortals you’ve seen won’t care about the state of mind of a mere martial artist. The sword intent spans hundreds of miles, striking like a tempest through the clouds and sea, like a casual slap creating huge holes in your heart’s path. You, being a self-reflective half-baked scholar, enjoy looking back now and then to ensure you haven’t taken a wrong turn, but every time you do, you subconsciously glance at those holes that resemble deep abysses, like gazing into a deep well, sinking deeper and deeper, unable to extricate yourself."

Chen Ping'an nodded. "In Old Dragon City, I realized this. The sword cultivators’ strikes in the Jiao Long Gorge had a huge impact on me, along with Wei Jin breaking the heavens with a single sword strike, and Fan Junmao of Old Dragon City flying to Guihua Island with his sword..."

At this point, Chen Ping'an’s expression grew serious. "However, after entering Shujian Lake, it’s not as you say, that I was completely unaware. In fact, it’s quite the opposite; I’ve already been consciously trying to diminish that influence little by little."

The old man laughed heartily. "Throwing stones into a well while being careful not to splash water at the bottom—can you ever fill it?"

Chen Ping'an was suddenly enlightened, wiping the sweat from his forehead as he asked, "May I ask, senior, what should I do then?"

The old man mockingly replied, "It seems that your trip to Shujian Lake not only left you looking haggard but even rusted your once adequate brain."

Chen Ping'an simply stared at him.

The old man paused for a moment. "Fortunately, some things are still intact; otherwise, you would truly be beyond saving."

The old man raised one fist. "Practice martial arts."

Then he raised his other hand, fingers together. "Practice swordsmanship."

Standing tall and looking down at Chen Ping'an, the old man said, "Even if you can obtain both, how do you differentiate between the main and the secondary? Once you’ve determined the main and secondary, how do you differentiate between the order of priority? If you haven’t figured anything out, just a muddled mess, living in a daze, it’s only right for you to be running circles outside the open city gates, feeling smug, convincing yourself that you’re not breaking through the bottleneck simply because you’re unwilling to. By the way, you can indeed step into the Sixth Realm, but it’s just like a person with soiled pants thinking they can clean themselves just by entering the house. In reality, they’ve brought the filth inside, not just on their body but all over the house. Luckily, you accidentally didn’t break through; otherwise, with such a messy entrance into the Sixth Realm, wouldn’t you have the gall to come up here and see me?"

The old man lightly stomped his foot.

A fierce gale blew toward Chen Ping'an, forcing him against the wall as he had to use his elbow to brace against it, struggling not to let the back of his head touch the wall.

A torrent of pure true energy coursed through his meridians like a fire dragon.

The old man squinted, still standing in place, but suddenly lifted a leg and kicked toward Chen Ping'an’s forehead. There was a loud thud as the back of Chen Ping'an’s head slammed into the wall, causing the pure true energy within him to come to a halt as if burdened by a mountain, forcing that fire dragon to crawl on the ground.

The old man clucked his tongue. "Chen Ping'an, have you really never thought about why you can hang on for three years without practicing punches? You should know that the intent of punches can still refine itself when not practiced, but can your body withstand it? Do you really think you’re a Golden Body Realm martial artist? Have you never asked yourself?"

Chen Ping'an found it hard to breathe, his face contorting in pain.

He had anticipated returning to the bamboo tower meant suffering, but he hadn’t expected it to be so direct.

However, the old man’s question made Chen Ping'an’s mind suddenly halt, as if he had pulled the reins on a horse. He temporarily set aside the pressure brought by the old man’s martial intent, calming his mind to think deeply about a question he had previously only grazed over.

Once again, the old man raised his foot and kicked toward Chen Ping'an’s abdomen. A strand of martial intent struck the delicate fire dragon true energy.

Chen Ping'an vaguely sensed the fire dragon's head and tail, and its four claws outside his heart's door, suddenly erupted with the sound of firecrackers, like spring thunder.

The old man said, "Clearly, there is a practitioner with exceptional skills nurturing this pure true energy of yours quietly. If I’m not mistaken, they must be a Daoist master who planted three seeds of flame within the head of your true energy fire dragon, as a sort of Daoist 'Heavenly Palace.' Through the method of refining with fire, they help you gradually clear the joints of this fire dragon's spine, allowing you to hope for your bones to flourish and shine, to step ahead and lay the foundation for entering the Golden Body Realm, akin to a practitioner pursuing a golden or jade form. The effort isn’t too grand, but it’s clever and exquisite, with perfect timing. So, who is it?"

Chen Ping'an looked bewildered.

Since the old man had seen through the root of the matter, he no longer pressed Chen Ping'an. Chen Ping'an leaned against the wall, drenched in sweat.

Eventually, a light of understanding flickered in Chen Ping'an’s eyes as he苦笑道, "I once met a friend’s master, who went by the title Fire Dragon Zhenren. Now that I think back, when we parted, that Daoist with the fire dragon embroidered on his robe did indeed point at me a few times."

The old man furrowed his brow. "Why would this old immortal bestow such an opportunity upon you for no reason?"

On the path of cultivation, fortune and misfortune are intertwined; one must be observant.

Chen Ping'an wiped his sweat and said with a smile, "He only gave my friend a small seal personally carved by the Grand Master of Longhu Mountain."

The old man nodded. "A mountain-top cultivator unwilling to owe debts, fearing the ties of karma. Your gift was his repayment, so it makes sense."

Then the old man suddenly asked, "Just that?"

Before Chen Ping'an could respond, the old man kicked out again, striking Chen Ping'an’s forehead with the force of a heavy hammer, knocking him unconscious. The old man didn’t even leave Chen Ping'an time to curse.

The old man scoffed, "At such a young age, looking so despondent, you really deserve a beating."

Another kick sent Chen Ping'an crashing against the wall, and as he fell to the ground, he bounced slightly. Just as he was coming to, the pain knocked him out again.

From beginning to end, the old man didn't deliberately hide his energy or words.

A ghost attached to an immortal's shed skin is nothing to boast about.

Under the eaves of the bamboo tower, the ghost Shi Rou sat in a green bamboo chair, feeling restless. She swallowed hard, suddenly realizing that compared to the brutal beatings Chen Ping'an was receiving upon his arrival, she had truly been living a life of leisure at Luopu Mountain these past few years.

 ### Chapter 523: The World of Wine

Shi Rou suddenly stood up, looking up at the second floor. An elderly man with bare feet was holding Chen Ping'an by the neck, lifting him over the railing with a casual motion before tossing him down. Shi Rou hurriedly caught him.

The old man said, "This fellow thinks too much and sleeps too little. Let him rest for now, and make sure no one disturbs him during this time."

Shi Rou quickly placed Chen Ping'an on the bed on the first floor, quietly backing out and closing the door, obediently sitting on a bamboo chair at the entrance like a guardian.

The old man descended from the bamboo building and approached the cliff's edge. The dense fog today obscured the view, creating a magnificent scene, as if the winds of heaven were shaking the tides of the sea. Standing at the height of Luopo Mountain, it felt like being in a marshland. Slightly to the left, there was a peak adjacent to Luopo Mountain that stood high above the sea of clouds, like an immortal on stilts. With a casual flick of his sleeve, the old man dispersed the entire sea of clouds, revealing a clear view of the mountains.

Shi Rou watched this scene with her eyelids fluttering, quickly lowering her gaze. If that flick had struck her, she couldn't imagine whether her soul would vanish into thin air.

Earlier, the person she had feared most, Cui Dongshan, had visited Luopo Mountain. He had been on the second floor, and Shi Rou had never seen him so lost and hopeless. The old man had stayed inside, while Cui Dongshan sat outside in the corridor, never entering, yet he referred to the old man as "grandpa."

From that moment on, Shi Rou understood how to deal with the old man: it was simple—try not to appear within the old man’s line of sight.

The old man stood at the edge, gazing into the distance.

A massive black serpent, its belly lined with gold and sporting four claws, surged up the wide mountain path from the direction of the mountain gate. As it approached the bamboo building, the black serpent dared not come any closer. Pei Qian knew it followed the rules and did not press it, instead landing on the ground and bending forward, while a girl in a pink skirt followed like a fluttering butterfly, incredibly adorable. The boy in green seemed more listless, sliding down the tail of the black serpent, lazily hanging behind the two as they were about to see Chen Ping'an. For some reason, the boy in green felt a bit guilty.

When Pei Qian arrived at the bamboo building, Shi Rou quickly repeated the old man's words. Pei Qian was both disappointed and worried, lightly walking to the entrance of the bamboo building, trying to catch a glimpse of the scene inside through the gaps in the green bamboo. Of course, she saw nothing. Still, she was not disheartened and walked all the way around the bamboo building before finally plopping down on Shi Rou's bamboo chair, crossing her arms and sulking. After all this time, she felt it was unfair that she, the burdened chief disciple, was not the first to see her master upon his return.

Pei Qian secretly threw a glance at the girl in the pink skirt.

The girl immediately understood and ran over to the bare-footed old man, softly asking, "Grandpa Cui, is my master doing well?"

The old man nodded, saying, "There are some troubles, but nothing that can't be resolved. Once Chen Ping'an wakes up refreshed, we can help him get back on track."

The girl in the pink skirt turned pale.

Help him get back on track?

She knew full well how difficult things had been for her master in the past. 

The boy in green, who had been eavesdropping on the conversation, also looked distressed. Poor master, returning home only to jump into a burning pit. No wonder this long trip took five years; if it were him, he wouldn't have dared to come back for fifty years.

Chen Ping'an slept for a full two days and nights before waking up. Upon opening his eyes, he sprang up like a carp and walked out of the room, noticing that Pei Qian and Zhu Lian were keeping watch outside, each on a small bamboo chair. Pei Qian was leaning against the back of her chair, legs stretched out, already fast asleep and drooling. For the girl with charcoal-black skin, this was a moment of frustration, feeling powerless in life. Chen Ping'an tiptoed, crouching down to look at Pei Qian. After a moment, she raised her arm, wiped her drool haphazardly, and fell back asleep, mumbling incoherently.

Chen Ping'an stood up and signaled for Zhu Lian to follow him. Together they made their way to the cliff's edge, where a stone table carved with a chessboard and four ancient stone stools embossed with cloud patterns awaited.

Zhu Lian lowered his voice and laughed softly, "If Pei Qian saw the young master like this, she would be heartbroken."

Chen Ping'an sighed, "It's already good enough. I had prepared for the worst, thinking I wouldn't be able to escape from Shujian Lake for seven or eight years."

Zhu Lian nodded, "Though I don't know the exact reasons, from our correspondence, I dare not ask on paper, but it seems what the young master has endured must have been a monumental challenge."

Chen Ping'an took out two jars of Shujian Lake's black crow wine and lightly clinked them with Zhu Lian's jar. Leaning against the stone table with one arm resting on it, he took a sip of the wine and remarked, "It's hard to put into words."

"What is character, if not the ability to endure the trials of heaven?" 

Zhu Lian turned to gaze at Chen Ping'an's profile, took a sip of wine, and gently advised, "Though you look weary now, as someone who has experienced the world of romance, I know that your current state will only elicit the sympathy of women. When you go down the mountain to the town or county, it would be best to wear a bamboo hat to cover your appearance. Otherwise, be careful not to repeat the mistakes made at Ziyang Manor; just a few glances from women could lead to trouble and debts of affection."

It was a rare moment of flattery.

Chen Ping'an stretched out his hand to rub his cheek and laughed, "Do you take me for a fool, or do you think those women are blind?"

Zhu Lian sighed, "Those who don't heed the advice of the elderly will suffer the consequences. Just wait, when you step outside the mountain, it won't be long before women..."

Chen Ping'an quickly waved his hand, "Enough, enough, just drink your wine."

Zhu Lian lamented, "Loyal words are often hard to hear!"

Chen Ping'an smiled without saying a word, squinting his eyes as he gazed into the distance, bathed in the pure moonlight that fell upon the world.

Although he was looking south at that moment, his new ventures lay to the north of Luopo Mountain.

In addition to the previously established Bullhorn Mountain of the "Camp and Settle" sect, there were also other locations like Zhu Sha Mountain, Ao Yu Bei, Bai Jian Terrace, and Hui Meng Mountain, all selected by the sects before the sinking of the "Sunken Ship" of Da Li, including the Xu family of Qingfeng City. Except for Bai Jian Terrace, which was located farthest west and was relatively small, the rest were situated in the southern part of the western mountain range, not far from Luopo Mountain. Especially Hui Meng Mountain, which covered a vast area, had already seen substantial investments by the previous sect that had now been dismantled, and a large number of Lu clan descendants were diligently working to build a sprawling celestial estate, resembling a paradise on earth. In the end, it was practically half sold and half gifted back to the Da Li court. One could only wonder how they felt now; they must be regretting it deeply.

The debts owed by the Song family of Da Li in Lao Long City, facilitated by Wei Ban, were used by Chen Ping'an to purchase the mountains, thus settling the matter neatly.

Especially that Bullhorn Mountain, which was about to be acquired by Chen Ping'an, would need to be temporarily registered under Wei Ban's name. Otherwise, without a proper title, the stakes were too great, and the Da Li aristocrats would become envious and jealous. However, behind the scenes, this source of wealth flowed with celestial money, and Chen Ping'an would share the profits equally with Wei Ban.

Back then, when he had helped Gu Can and others seize water in the fields countless times, he never imagined that he would now be guarding such a bountiful "field."

Chen Ping'an snapped back to reality and asked, "Zhu Lian, haven't you been sparring often with the elder Cui?"

Zhu Lian smiled and shook his head, "The elder's fists are incredibly strong; he has already reached the pinnacle of martial arts that we martial artists aspire to. Who wouldn't admire him? I simply didn't want to disturb his quiet cultivation."

Zhu Lian leaned back, turning to look towards the bamboo building, "I hope the elder won't mind my words."

Silence fell, with no response.

Zhu Lian continued, "The elder rarely makes an appearance. He only occasionally takes his walking stick to wander the mountains and engages in scholarly discussions with a few old scholars at Lin Lu Academy on Piyun Mountain. He prefers to be like a carefree cloud or wild crane."

Zhu Lian suddenly recalled something, saying, "I accidentally found a good seedling in the county town. She is a rich girl who moved from the Da Li capital to Longquan. She's quite young, only thirteen, about the same age as our troublesome disciple. Though it's a bit late for her to start learning martial arts, it’s still manageable. I have already explained the situation to her elders. Now, I just need the young master's approval to bring her to Luopo Mountain. We have constructed a few new residences on Luopo Mountain, which are more than enough for guests, and all funded by Da Li, so we won't need to spend a single coin."

Chen Ping'an nodded. With more people at Luopo Mountain now, it indeed made sense to have these accommodations. However, after signing a formal contract with the ritual department of Da Li to purchase those peaks, even after deducting the ones rented to Ruan Qiong, it seemed feasible for each person to have their own mountain. This was truly a sign of wealth and strength. By then, Chen Ping'an would become the second largest landowner in Longquan County after Ruan Qiong, occupying thirty percent of the western mountainous territory. Excluding the petite Zhenzhu Mountain, any of the remaining peaks were rich in spiritual energy, sufficient for a Golden Core Earth Immortal to cultivate.

Curious, Chen Ping'an asked, "If you want to bring her up the mountain, that's fine, but what title will she have at Luopo Mountain? Your direct disciple?"

If Zhu Lian were to take her as his first disciple in the Haoran world, Chen Ping'an would indeed be looking forward to her martial journey.

Among the four in the Ouhua Blessed Land, Zhu Lian currently held the highest realm, being a true wanderer warrior. Though he had taken a shortcut, Chen Ping'an felt deep down that Zhu Lian’s choice, while seeming somewhat opportunistic, was indeed the best path.

Zhu Lian shook his head, "I have no interest in being someone’s master. Let her just be a registered disciple of Luopo Mountain for now. If anyone finds her talent suitable in the future, they can take her. My actions are merely to ensure that the good fortune does not flow to outsiders, aiming to add some liveliness to Luopo Mountain. Otherwise, it would be filled with gods and monsters, which doesn't feel right and seems detrimental to the feng shui. Speaking of which, if this were in Ouhua Blessed Land, a girl with such talent would be like picking up a book while shopping at a bookstore. However, back in her hometown, I reckon it would draw the attention of numerous sect masters, who would fight over her, a chaotic scene indeed."

Zhu Lian crossed his legs, holding the wine jar of celestial brew, gently shaking it, and sighed, "No wonder Haoran is a place of great talents; it cannot be compared to Ouhua Blessed Land."

Chen Ping'an asked with a smile, "How did you persuade the girl's family? It's not a joke that the poor study literature while the rich study martial arts."

Zhu Lian laughed, "The situation is not complicated. The reason that family moved to Longquan County was that they couldn’t survive in the capital anymore. Beauty brings disaster, you know. The girl is headstrong, and her parents and elders are equally tough, unwilling to bow down, which led them to offend the wrong kind of local powers. I helped settle that group of troublemakers, and the girl is family-oriented and values relationships. They already have two studying seeds in the family, so they don’t need her to hold up the facade. Now, having implicated her brother and younger sibling, she feels guilty. Knowing she could associate with a celestial power in Longquan County, she agreed without hesitation. She’s still somewhat naïve about how martial arts work and how much hardship it entails, but since I noticed her, she is undoubtedly not lacking in spiritual energy. You’ll see when you meet her; she shares similarities with Sui You, yet is distinctly different."

Chen Ping'an nodded in agreement.

Zhu Lian was indeed reliable in his endeavors.

Suddenly, Zhu Lian turned and shouted, "Troublesome disciple, your master is about to head out again! Still sleeping?!"

Pei Qian tumbled over with her chair, still in a daze. Upon seeing that familiar figure, she rushed over, but as soon as she caught sight of Chen Ping'an's appearance, tears streamed down her charcoal-black face, and she couldn't say a word. How could her master have changed so much? So thin and dark; why would he want to look like her? Chen Ping'an straightened up, smiling, "After staying at Luopo Mountain for three years, why haven’t you grown taller? Haven't you been eating enough? Just been playing around? Have you forgotten to copy books?"

Pei Qian threw her arms around Chen Ping'an, crying pitifully. She lamented that she should have shamelessly followed her master on his journey. If she had been there to take care of him, even if she were clumsy, at least she would have been able to chat with him at Shujian Lake.

Chen Ping'an shot a glare at Zhu Lian, who was reveling in the situation.

Zhu Lian took a big swig from the wine jar, then, while Chen Ping'an was softly comforting Pei Qian, Zhu Lian seized the remaining half jar of black crow wine and left.

It was as if he wanted to leave the moonlight and time for that long-separated master and disciple.

Pei Qian finally managed to stop crying and sat on a stone stool beside them.

Although she had grown a bit taller, it was hardly noticeable. A typical girl of thirteen or fourteen years would have started to resemble a slender willow, with a more developed face. But Pei Qian still seemed like that charcoal-black girl from when they parted in Hongzhu Town.

She chattered about her "accomplishments" in Longquan County over the past few years. Every so often, she would go down the mountain to manage the ancestral home in Mud Bottle Alley, visiting the graves during the spring festival and Qingming Festival, overseeing the two shops on Qilong Alley. Between copying books, she would carry her walking stick, riding that black serpent to patrol the borders of Luopo Mountain, preventing thieves from sneaking into the bamboo building. She also practiced the six-step stance her master taught her, the Sword Qi Eighteen Stops, and the sword techniques and dragging knife methods taught by her elder sister in the female crown sect. Not to mention she was perfecting that almost peak-level Frenzied Demon Sword Technique… In short, she was very busy, not messing around at all, and certainly not neglecting her duties—heaven bear witness!

As for chasing dogs or kicking geese or playing with a shuttlecock, those trivial things she thought needn't be mentioned to her master. As the leading disciple, these remarkable deeds were simply her responsibilities and didn't require boasting.

After patiently listening to Pei Qian's embellished stories, Chen Ping'an smiled and asked, "Did the elder Cui not teach you anything?"

Pei Qian's eyes rolled around, shaking her head vigorously, looking pitiful. "That old man has high standards and looks down on me! Master, you don't know; the elder has such a lofty demeanor, like a predecessor of the martial world, more immortal-like than the cultivators on the mountain. I truly admire him! Alas, it's a pity I couldn't catch his eye and have him guide me on my Frenzied Demon Sword Technique. This is the only thing I feel guilty about towards you, master."

Perhaps fearing Chen Ping'an wouldn't believe her, Pei Qian, with a fist against her palm, made a crisp sound as she felt aggrieved, "I brought shame upon you, master!"

Chen Ping'an bent over and flicked her forehead with his finger, causing her to gasp in pain and cover her head.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "If you can't handle the hardships, just admit it. What high standards? Who are you trying to fool?"

Pei Qian rubbed her slightly reddened forehead, her eyes wide with surprise, "Master, did you learn the heart-seeing technique of immortals on this trip? How come you can always learn such amazing skills no matter where you go? Does that mean I, your chief disciple, will have to catch up to you? Am I destined to eat dust behind you for the rest of my life...?"

Chen Ping'an pinched the ear of this sycophant, "Oh, keep spinning your tales; let's see how long you can keep it up."

Pei Qian grinned, but upon seeing her master's face, she felt like crying again and lowered her head.

Chen Ping'an sighed and patted her little head, smiling, "I have good news for you—soon, Hui Meng Mountain, Zhu Sha Mountain, Ao Yu Bei, and other peaks will all belong to your master, including Bullhorn Mountain, which has a celestial crossing. Your master will have half, and from now on, you can confidently collect tolls from all sorts of characters coming and going."

Pei Qian's enthusiasm dimmed as she replied with a simple "Oh."

Chen Ping'an placed his hands in his sleeves and continued to gaze into the night south of Luopo Mountain. It was said that on clear days, if one had sharp enough eyes, they could see the outline of Hongzhu Town and Xiuhua River.

Pei Qian leaned over the stone table, lightly tracing her fingers along the grooves of the chessboard, her eyes fixed on her master.

Silence hung in the air.

After receiving news from Zhu Lian, the boy in green and the girl in pink hurried over from the newly constructed residence. Chen Ping'an turned and smiled, waving for them to sit down. With Pei Qian, they formed a complete table.

The girl in pink quickly ran over, bowing to Chen Ping'an with utmost respect, "Master."

The boy in green also performed a bow, lifting his head afterward with a beaming smile, "Master, you finally deigned to return! But where are the beautiful little mistresses you should have brought with you?"

The girl in pink glared at him, "Don't speak nonsense!"

The boy in green picked his nose and plopped down on the stone stool opposite Chen Ping'an, mimicking Pei Qian's posture on the table, looking puzzled. "Master, are you wearing a human skin mask while wandering the world? At night, I’m a bit timid, and you look kind of creepy. You should take it off quickly."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Are you implying you don't want a red envelope?"

The boy in green raised his head, glancing around. "To be honest, now that I look closely, Master, you seem even more manly."

Chen Ping'an scratched his head and thought, Luopo Mountain? It might as well be renamed to Sycophant Mountain.

Chen Ping'an then took out three items from his close reach: the Nine Palace Treasure Box gifted by the old cultivator at the Qianhe River crossing, an old Longyu cloth rain jade pendant as compensation from the Fu family of Lao Long City, and the last remaining fox fur beauty talisman, presenting them to Pei Qian, the boy in green, and the girl in pink respectively.

Pei Qian opened her gift to find an array of exquisite little items, each unique and, most importantly, plentiful in number.

The boy in green hesitated for a moment but ultimately accepted the priceless old Longyu cloth rain jade pendant.

The girl in pink played with the fox fur talisman, reluctant to part with it.

Chen Ping'an smiled and explained to her, "From now on, you won't have to do all the cleaning by yourself. After infusing it with spiritual energy, it can summon a talisman puppet to help you. Its intelligence is no different from a regular girl, and you can even chat with it."

The girl in pink stood up again to bow and thank Chen Ping'an, performing her gestures meticulously.

Chen Ping'an couldn’t stop her.

The boy in green suddenly spoke, "Isn't this a bit too precious?"

Chen Ping'an joked, "Is the sun rising in the west?"

The boy in green sighed and thought for a moment, "I can't accept this. I happened to hear how rare this old Longyu jade pendant is. It’s not even comparable to the snake gallstone involving the Great Dao. No matter how much more you give me, I wouldn't refuse..."

The boy in green placed the jade pendant on the table.

Seeing the determination in his eyes, Chen Ping'an didn’t insist on him accepting the gift, nor did he take it back. Instead, he took a sip of black crow wine, "I heard your brother, the Water God, came to our Longquan County recently?"

The boy in green drooped his head, "Yes, that’s right."

Chen Ping'an said, "Don’t think you’re foolish. It’s your brother the Water God who isn’t smart enough. If he comes again, just do as you wish. If you don’t want to see him, just say you’re in closed-door cultivation and let Pei Qian block him for you. If you do want to see him, then continue to entertain him with fine wine. If you can't afford the wine, whether it's money or wine, you can always borrow from me."

The boy in green had a strange expression, "I thought you'd advise me against seeing him."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "After hundreds of years in the rivers and lakes, it's a pity to part ways just like that. However, if you still want to be friends, there will be some busy times when you can't help. Just be direct with him; a true friend will understand."

The boy in green muttered, "In the rivers and lakes, saying I can't help a brother isn't very gallant."

Once he said that, he felt even guiltier.

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Alright, as long as it’s related to money, you can still think about pretending to be wealthy in front of your Water God brother. If it doesn’t work out, just say it does. No worries; you can still come to me for money, and you can keep being the extravagant second-in-command at Yujiang."

The boy in green was completely stunned, forgetting to call him "Master" and directly addressing him, "Chen Ping'an, has your head been knocked loose on this journey?"

Chen Ping'an sat quietly, hands in his sleeves, the breeze brushing against his face, "When the day comes that you understand, that brothers are no longer brothers, and even friends can’t be friends anymore, at least you can hold your head high, knowing you’ve never wronged anyone. Here at Luopo Mountain, we’re not starving. In the world of rivers and lakes, as long as there’s wine to drink, what does money matter? If you lack it, I have plenty. If you don’t have much, I have a lot."

The boy in green grabbed the old Longyu cloth rain jade pendant, wiped his face, said nothing, and ran off.

Pei Qian and the girl in pink exchanged glances.

Chen Ping'an actually had more to say to the boy in green but didn't voice it.

Regardless, Chen Ping'an didn’t want the boy in green to be too disappointed in the rivers and lakes he cherished.

Wei Ban suddenly appeared at the cliff's edge, lightly clearing his throat, "Chen Ping'an, I have some news to tell you."

Chen Ping'an stood up, "What is it?"

Wei Ban pointed towards the mountain gate, "A good girl has come to visit Luopo Mountain tonight."

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 524: The Struggle of Water and Fire (Part 1)

Chen Ping'an tentatively asked, "Miss Ruan?"

Wei Ban smiled and nodded.

Chen Ping'an continued, "Do you really need to remind me? With Miss Ruan's temperament, once she ascends the mountain, she will definitely come to the bamboo house."

Wei Ban wore a hurt expression, as if her kind intentions were being dismissed. 

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "I'm just going to meet Miss Ruan. Even if it's nighttime, with so many eyes on us, and nothing exciting to see, as the deity of North Peak, are you really so free that you can just stand idle?"

Wei Ban, with an air of righteousness, pointed toward the mountain gate and then gestured toward Chen Ping'an, "In our North Peak's jurisdiction, the two biggest landowners are meeting. Shouldn't I pay a little attention to it?"

Ignoring Wei Ban, Chen Ping'an rose to greet Ruan Xiu. Now that he knew she was visiting, as the master of the Falling Star Mountain, he had to show some hospitality.

Wei Ban stayed behind, muttering to herself, "Is there truly nothing happening? This fellow looks quite at ease."

Upon hearing that her particularly gentle and kind-hearted sister in green was visiting, Pei Qian was more excited than anyone else. She bounced up, her feet barely touching the ground as she rushed off, only to crash into a curtain of mist that rippled around her. Stumbling, she found herself back at the stone table, looking around to see subtle ripples in the air that shifted unpredictably. Annoyed, she exclaimed, "Wei Ban, as a mountain deity, isn't it a little shameless to use such petty tricks like a ghost wall?"

Wei Ban sighed, "What are you getting involved for? Let’s say your master is tired and wants to sleep; would it be appropriate for you to wander around with a big lantern inside the house?"

Crossing her arms, Pei Qian rubbed her chin thoughtfully before asking seriously, "It's not exactly appropriate to sleep without a proper wedding, right? I heard that Master Ruan is getting on in years and his eyesight isn't what it used to be, so he doesn't like my master being around Sister Ruan. Why don't you come with me to visit the Dragon Spring Sword Sect and chat with Master Ruan? By dawn, if the rice is cooked, then whether she’s the second mistress or not, she’ll still be the second mistress, hehe, the more mistresses, the merrier..."

Of course, Pei Qian was just joking. With her master absent and Wei Ban not the type to report her mischief, she felt free to speak her mind.

However, Pei Qian genuinely liked Ruan Xiu, and it wasn't just because she had seen Cui Dongshan's painting of the River of Time. When Pei Qian first met that sister in green with her long ponytail at Falling Star Mountain, she felt an instant fondness. Looking at Ruan Xiu was like gazing upon an incredibly "warm" painting—not the kind that sent chills down your spine like Cui Dongshan's, but rather one of boiling seas and lakes, with flames soaring high, everything bathed in a vibrant red.

A vision flashed in Pei Qian's mind: a woman seated on a throne, propping her chin on one hand, gazing down upon the earth. The hazy figure of Sister Ruan held in her other hand what appeared to be a sun plucked from the heavens, gently rotating it as if it were the essence of the world's fire, radiating countless beams of light in all directions.

This was a secret Pei Qian hadn’t even shared with the girl in the pink skirt, intending to tell her master about it during their private moments later on.

Wei Ban felt a headache coming on.

Fortunately, the elderly Cui had already exited the bamboo house. Pei Qian quickly sat back on the stone bench and turned to the girl in the pink skirt to ask for some sunflower seeds, which the latter swiftly produced and handed to her master’s eldest disciple. They had a good relationship.

Pei Qian, munching on sunflower seeds, still felt a bit intimidated by the old man, especially after hearing the girl in the pink skirt talk about her master’s training experiences; she had almost had nightmares. Thus, she preferred to wander outside, fearing the old man would see right through her as a once-in-a-thousand-years martial arts prodigy.

The old man looked at Pei Qian and the girl in the pink skirt and said, "Aren't you two going back to sleep?"

Reluctantly, Pei Qian took the girl’s hand and left. Not far from the bamboo house, a few modest residences had been built. Pei Qian and the girl in the pink skirt lived in the same courtyard as neighbors.

The old man gazed toward the mountain gate and sneered, "Daring to come see me with a sword on his back shows his character hasn't changed much."

Wei Ban asked with a smile, "If Chen Ping'an were too afraid to bring his sword up the mountain, would you be worried, Mr. Cui?"

The old man laughed heartily, "Worried? It just means I’d have to teach him a few more punches. He could easily revert back to the little brat he once was. In this world, there’s no problem that can’t be solved with a fist. There are only two types of problems: ones I can explain with a punch, and others that require two punches to enlighten him."

Wei Ban smiled wryly, "But Mr. Cui is of noble lineage."

"What if I was once the head of the Cui family? Did that make me a sage? If I can't make it as a scholar myself, how can I expect to produce any sage descendants?" The old man chuckled self-deprecatingly. "So I understand well the difficulties faced by scholars, as well as their inherent flaws."

Wei Ban chose not to respond.

This mountain deity, the most prominent in Baoping Continent, stood on the cliff's edge, looking ethereal in his flowing white robes, like a rare spirit herb flourishing atop the heights.

The old man asked, "Why did Ruan Qiong change her mind at the last minute and not accept the immortal ferry left behind by the Ox Horn Mountain's Pouch of the Unfortunate? Why would she turn such a great opportunity over to you and Chen Ping'an?"

Wei Ban replied, "I thought Mr. Cui wouldn't care about such mundane matters."

The old man smirked, "That rascal Zhu Lian, while playing Go with those kids, kept mumbling about it. It was so annoying that I almost couldn't help but punch him off the cliff a few times."

Wei Ban and Zhu Lian had a congenial relationship, feeling as if they had met each other too late.

How powerful was Zhu Lian? Powerful enough that Wei Ban sincerely felt if she had known him a few years earlier, she could have resolved her misunderstandings long ago. She wouldn’t have had to pass by him on the path at Chess Stone Mountain without even daring to look at him, but rather left early to find him. Even if fate decreed they could never be together, as a deity of mountains and waters, with a lifespan akin to celestial beings, she should have been able to witness her own joys and sorrows across lifetimes, rather than sighing year after year from the shadows of Chess Stone Mountain.

As for why Zhu Lian refused to learn martial arts from the old Mr. Cui, Wei Ban never pried.

Now, Wei Ban explained, "About the mountain purchase, I had two honest discussions with Saint Ruan. On one hand, Saint Ruan had rented several of Chen Ping'an's mountain peaks for hundreds of years. It was mutually beneficial at the time. Chen Ping'an kept Falling Star Mountain and Zhu Pearl Mountain to avoid drawing too much attention from cultivators from the capital of Dali and beyond, while Saint Ruan could expand her territory. However, after Chen Ping'an's rapid rise, he was no longer in danger, and Saint Ruan felt a bit guilty, thinking the original contract, made out of good intentions, had favored Chen Ping'an too much. Therefore, she was willing to take back the ferry and hand it over. With my mediation, the Dali court, Ox Horn Mountain's Pouch of the Unfortunate, and Chen Ping'an all have a graceful exit."

Wei Ban smiled, "After all, the Dali court prefers to see a harmonious relationship between me and Saint Ruan."

The old man laughed knowingly, "On the other hand, Saint Ruan doesn't want to have too many personal entanglements with Chen Ping'an. The fairer the deal, the less face he has to trick her daughter."

Wei Ban refrained from commenting.

This had nearly become a thorn in Ruan Qiong's side.

Together, Wei Ban and the old man looked toward a spot at the foot of the mountain, exchanging a knowing smile.

It was rare to see a saint reduced to such a state.

Wei Ban said, "I'll go ease Saint Ruan's mind."

The old man nodded, "If it were ordinary folks worrying as parents, that would be understandable, but this blacksmith in the Wind and Snow Temple is surprisingly impressive."

Wei Ban vanished from sight.

In the North Peak territory of Dali, Wei Ban was the master of mountains and waters.

In fact, she had a more legitimate claim than Saint Ruan herself.

Even if the other three peaks of Dali were confirmed in the future, Wei Ban would still be the one with the most extensive territory among the five mountain deities of Baoping Continent. Due to the geographical layout of Baoping Continent being long from north to south and narrow from east to west, this meant that the East Peak and West Peak would have inherent disadvantages compared to the North and South Peaks. Moreover, the foundation of Dali still lay in the north, and the capital was in the region where the Song family thrived, so the North Peak would naturally hold a slight advantage over the South Peak. Therefore, even if the overall situation of the continent settled, it was unlikely that the Song family would relocate the capital all at once to the south, as there was still a Lake-view Academy down south, and the Song family wouldn't sever their connection to the north in one go.

As a result, when the hooves of the Dali iron cavalry trampled upon the shores of the South Sea of the old Dragon City, the only mountain deity who could match Wei Ban was the Central Peak.

---

Halfway up Falling Star Mountain.

Chen Ping'an met Ruan Xiu.

Ruan Xiu looked at the young man who had stopped and waved, blinking her eyes before quickly stepping forward, and the two ascended the mountain side by side.

There was no awkwardness between friends who hadn't seen each other for a while; everything flowed naturally.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "I actually saw your performance at Shujian Lake and Furong Mountain that night from a distance on Qingxia Island. You were quite impressive."

Ruan Xiu blushed slightly and replied softly, "I went down the mountain for some experience, traveling south with some Dali cultivators. Later, I met someone who claimed to be your student, Cui Dongshan, and we ended up going to Meiyu Country together."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Later on, I traveled to Meiyu Country with some friends and even saw the battlefield where you chased after the sword cultivator Zhu Ying. It was over by Spring Flower River."

Ruan Xiu remained silent.

She had no recollection of any Spring Flower River at all.

She never bothered to remember these things. Even though this journey south, after leaving the immortal ferry, she had seen many people and events while riding through the stone-haired kingdom, she still hadn’t retained any memories. When she took charge at Furong Mountain and commanded the fire dragon to defeat that exceptionally lucky young man, as compensation, on her way back north, she had found three candidates for the Dali cultivators and had maintained good relations with them, yet in the end, she couldn't even remember their names. Instead, she remembered plenty of delicious snacks from Lutong City.

Suddenly, Ruan Xiu said, "Not far to the north, my father just bought a mountain called Jinrong, which is close to Falling Star Mountain and Gray Mist Mountain. He plans to set up a new sword furnace there, and they’ve been working through the night. Tonight, I went over to check it out and saw the phenomenon of the cloud sea dissipating around here, so I was worried about Pei Qian and came to take a look."

Chen Ping'an struggled to suppress a smile.

But he said nothing.

Others might not know how profound Mr. Cui's martial arts were, but the mountain deity Wei Ban and the saint Ruan Qiong certainly did, apart from the old man Yang from the apothecary.

If Ruan Qiong knew, it often meant that Ruan Xiu would know too.

Ruan Xiu chuckled softly; telling lies was truly not her forte. She was awkward about it, and her father had never been fooled, often enjoying calling her out on it. This person beside her wouldn’t expose her.

Chen Ping'an didn’t head to the bamboo house.

Instead, he led Ruan Xiu all the way to the summit.

 ### Chapter 525: The Conflict of Water and Fire (Part Two)

As the master of the Fallen Leaves Mountain, it was strange that Chen Ping’an had never visited the mountain god temple at the peak.

Their conversation was light, filled with casual chatter about trivial matters. They spoke of the recent repairs at the Immortal’s Grave, the business of the two shops on Qi Long Alley, the brood of chickens Chen Ping’an had asked her to look after years ago, and that one dirt dog.

As they approached the mountain god temple, just as Chen Ping’an was about to say something, Ruan Xiu stopped in her tracks, turned around to look into the distance, and smiled, “I know what you want to say.”

Sitting on the steps, Chen Ping’an wore a calm expression. The moonlight bathed the stone steps in a silvery sheen, ancient trees flanking the path. The moonlight flowed down the slope like a stream, mingling with the shadows of algae and the silhouettes of pines and cypresses. This scene felt dreamlike, as if one were caught in a half-remembered dream.

Chen Ping’an spoke earnestly, “It seems that no matter how I say it, it would be wrong. But if I don’t say anything, that would be even worse. Perhaps I’m just being overly sentimental. It’s only natural for a man to feel happy if a woman likes him. Even if many men, once they have a crush, deliberately entangle themselves with other good women, I wouldn’t dare to say they are wrong. I believe many find joy in such matters, even thinking it’s something remarkable. But that’s not who I am. If I were to act like that, I would be betraying Ning Yao and you, Miss Ruan. But if I’ve misunderstood your intentions, if I’ve been overthinking, then that would be the best outcome. However, even if you were to be angry with me, and we could no longer be friends, I still want to make things clear today. You’ve helped me immensely over the years, and I’ve held that in my heart. To put it plainly, even in front of Ning Yao, I would still tell her about your kindness, Miss Ruan. Some debts of gratitude must be repaid. No matter how many years pass, some things should never be forgotten. I do like you, but it’s not romantic love. If my actions back then caused you to misunderstand, then the fault lies with me, Chen Ping’an. So, what then…?”

His words, like pebbles in the stream, lacked sharpness but were still as hard as stone, unlike the intertwining algae or the playful fish in the water.

Ruan Xiu looked at the young man before her, who seemed both sad and guilty, and she felt a pang of sadness too. 

How could she have returned to her homeland only to feel sorrow again? Especially because of her.

As for feelings of affection, Ruan Xiu wasn’t as tangled as he imagined. Questions of right or wrong didn’t even cross her mind.

I like you, and not even the heavens can stop that.  
I don’t like you, and even the heavens are of no use.  
It was such a simple matter.

This lazy girl even thought that whether she liked someone or not had little to do with that person.

But Ruan Xiu didn’t share these thoughts with Chen Ping’an.

The Dao does not compete for daily trifles.

Ruan Xiu sat quietly and asked, “If you had met me first instead of Ning Yao, what would have happened?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head without hesitation. “You can ask that, Miss Ruan, but I cannot entertain such thoughts. Therefore, there will be no answer.”

Ruan Xiu rested her chin on her hands, gazing into the distance, murmuring, “In this regard, you’re just like my father. He’s quite strong-willed, never seeking my mother’s reincarnation, saying that even if he found her, she wouldn’t be the same person anymore. Besides, not everyone can recover their past life memories. So, it’s better not to see her, to avoid letting down the woman who has always lived in his heart, and to not delay the woman beside him.”

When it came to Master Ruan, Chen Ping’an chose not to respond.

Ruan Xiu turned back with a smile. “Did you not bring any gifts on your return home?”

Chen Ping’an replied awkwardly, “I wouldn’t dare bring gifts. If I didn’t clarify things, wouldn’t that lead to more misunderstandings?”

Then he relaxed and smiled. “But in the future, I can bring gifts for you, Miss Ruan.”

Ruan Xiu tilted her head, her eyes sparkling with humor. “What do you mean by clarifying things?”

Chen Ping’an wore a blank expression as he hurriedly retraced their conversation in his mind. 

Logically, if Miss Ruan didn’t like him, and even if she did have a slight affection, he believed he had made things clear.

Ruan Xiu chuckled, “Alright, it’s just that you’re not the type to like me, and you’re worried I might be that way toward you, feeling a bit awkward about it. You’re afraid that being too straightforward would make me uncomfortable, right? Don’t worry, I’m fine. I’m not lying to you. My affection isn’t what you think it is; you’ll understand that later, or you can ask your disciple, Cui Dongshan. In any case, it won’t interfere with our friendship.”

Chen Ping’an nodded. Miss Ruan’s words were a bit convoluted, but they seemed clearer than his own.

Ruan Xiu asked, “Does Ning Yao like you too?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “She does.”

Ruan Xiu nodded. “Chen Ping’an, why do you overthink everything? Why not think more about yourself?”

Chen Ping’an was at a loss for words.

Ruan Xiu clapped her knees and stood up. “Alright, that’s enough for now. I suddenly feel a bit hungry. Let’s head home for a late-night snack.”

Chen Ping’an stood up as well and suggested, “Why not come to my bamboo house? I have everything for a late-night feast there—plenty of ingredients in stock, dried fish, bamboo shoots, salted meat. There are also many wild vegetables, ready to be stewed. It shouldn’t take much effort.”

Ruan Xiu smiled, “My father is still waiting at the foot of the mountain. I’m afraid he might stew you for a late-night snack.”

Chen Ping’an wiped the sweat off his forehead.

As Ruan Xiu descended the steps, she turned and said with a grin, “Don’t see me off.”

Chen Ping’an replied, “I’ll just escort you to the fork in the road.”

The two of them walked slowly down the mountain together.

Ruan Xiu seemed at ease, like a celestial being wandering through the forest.

Eventually, they parted ways, with Ruan Xiu continuing down the mountain while Chen Ping’an took the path toward the bamboo house.

Suddenly, Chen Ping’an recalled a beautiful saying inscribed on a bamboo slip:  
*The stars and moon are bright, the Milky Way above,  
Silence reigns, yet sounds weave through the trees.*

Outside Fallen Leaves Mountain, Wei Ban stood beside Ruan Qiong.

The man sat on a giant boulder.

Wei Ban smiled, “Mr. Ruan, don’t you want to take a look at Fallen Leaves Mountain? If it’s not suitable for me to be here, I can leave. I promise not to see or hear anything from both the mountain and the outside.”

Ruan Qiong shook his head, sipping his drink. “I haven’t sunk that low. If I don’t trust Chen Ping’an, should I not trust my own daughter?”

Wei Ban was left speechless.  
If Ruan Qiong truly trusted his daughter, why would he sneak out for a stroll?

Ruan Qiong continued sipping his drink while Wei Ban stood by.

Ruan Qiong asked, “Wei Ban, who do you think will be the next emperor of the Great Li?”

Wei Ban wasn’t afraid of being overheard. In the Bei Yue region, who would dare to eavesdrop? That would be courting death.

As for the elder from the Yang family’s medicine shop, he wouldn’t care about such matters.

Wei Ban pondered for a moment before answering, “For now, it seems both Song He and Song Jixin have potential. Of course, Song He has a greater chance; he has deep roots and is more likely to gain popular support. As for Song Jixin, the Ministry of Rites has been a bit desperate, secretly wagering on him. But in the end, it all comes down to the decisions of those two. Even the empress’s words won’t matter. I believe Song Changjing and Cui Chen will ultimately make a surprising choice.”

Ruan Qiong remarked, “The Great Li emperor has left at quite an opportune time.”

Wei Ban smiled but said nothing.

Ruan Qiong was a top-ranking servant of the Great Li, and also the most sought-after master blacksmith in the Fengxue Temple. His connections spanned the continent, and his ties to the Fengxue Temple had never severed. After all, the figure on the Dragon Slayer Stone Cliff was not just a representation of Ruan Qiong abandoning the Fengxue Temple but rather a testament to their ongoing relationship.

Wei Ban was the mountain spirit of the Great Li, bestowed by the previous emperor. It would be wise to tread lightly with any irreverent remarks.

Discussing the two princes was trivial, and chatting about the vassal kings and national advisors was acceptable. However, regarding the life and death of Song Zhengchun, Wei Ban had always remained silent, whether Ruan Qiong mentioned it or the old Jiaolong from Huang Ting Country did.

In the distance, a figure dressed in blue appeared, moving slowly yet appearing like drifting smoke.

Ruan Xiu spotted Ruan Qiong and Wei Ban. She nodded in greeting to Wei Ban before turning to her father. “Father, what a coincidence! You’re out for a walk too?”

Ruan Qiong nodded and casually tossed aside the empty wine jug.

Wei Ban took the hint and left.

Ruan Qiong’s lips moved slightly, but he simply pulled out another jug of wine from his belongings, broke the seal, and started drinking.

Ruan Xiu smiled, “I just ran into Chen Ping’an on Fallen Leaves Mountain.”

Ruan Qiong’s expression hardened, “What a coincidence.”

It was clear they were father and daughter.

Ruan Xiu picked and chose her words, recounting their conversation to her father. The meaning remained largely unchanged, but she slightly altered some phrases.

Ruan Qiong took a large gulp of wine, wiped his mouth, and said solemnly, “Is Chen Ping’an blind? What’s wrong with my daughter? How could he not like her?! Who gave him the courage to dislike her?”

Ruan Xiu smiled, her eyes narrowing.

Ruan Qiong was exasperated and took another large drink, falling silent for a moment. “But this kid is still a decent person, unlike many men who, while eating from one bowl, are eyeing another. In this regard, I can’t find any fault with Chen Ping’an.”

Suddenly, Ruan Qiong’s expression shifted to suspicion. “Xiu Xiu, could it be this kid has become more cunning after five years in the world, deliberately retreating to advance? Just to catch me off guard?”

Ruan Xiu looked at her father with a hint of disdain, choosing not to respond.

Ruan Qiong continued, “That kid shouldn’t be so unscrupulous.”

Ruan Qiong asked, “Xiu Xiu, are you really not bothered at all? Tell me honestly, do you like Chen Ping’an? I’ll only ask this once, and I won’t ask again, so don’t lie to me.”

Ruan Xiu laughed, raising her hands and shaking them vigorously. “No, I don’t.”

Ruan Qiong was skeptical. “If I were to fight Chen Ping’an, who would you help?”

Ruan Xiu replied earnestly, “Of course, I’d help you, Father.”

Ruan Qiong felt a sense of relief.

Suddenly, he turned around.

Ruan Xiu’s face was sincere, showing no trace of deception.

“Get home early.” Ruan Qiong finally felt somewhat reassured, transforming into a radiant beam and soaring away.

Ruan Xiu remained leisurely, walking through the mountains and forests until she arrived at a stream, kneeling beside it to cup her hands and scoop up water, where the moonlight shattered into countless fragments.

At the bamboo house on Fallen Leaves Mountain, just as Chen Ping’an wanted to sit alone at the stone table for a moment, he was unexpectedly pulled by the old man with the surname Cui into the second-floor room.

Then, the old man kicked him in the abdomen, sending him crashing against the wall. Chen Ping’an braced himself on the ground, flipping over, but before he could land on his feet, the old man struck him on the forehead with a punch, causing the bamboo house to shake with a loud bang.

The power behind that punch was evident.

Having taken an inexplicable beating, Chen Ping’an wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, cursed under his breath, and shouted angrily, “If you have the guts, fight me at the same level!”

The old man chuckled disdainfully. “Sure, let’s go with the five realms’ exchange of blows?”

Chen Ping’an charged forward using the Six Steps stance.

The old man remained still, even placing one hand behind his back, gesturing with the other for Chen Ping’an to throw the first punch.

On his sixth step, Chen Ping’an stomped heavily on the ground, his momentum like a rainbow.

Then, without warning, he turned and burst out of the still-open bamboo door on the second floor, calling out lightly as he drew his sword, soaring into the sky, howling away into the distance.

He could accept a fair fight.

But tonight’s old man was clearly out of sorts, treating him like a punching bag, and that was unacceptable.

The bare-footed old man didn’t immediately punch him down but clicked his tongue in wonder. “You’re quite slippery, yet when it comes to love, you’ve become such a blockhead? At such a young age, have you really gone through so much that nothing seems right anymore? How absurd!”

The old man thought for a moment before stepping outside onto the railing and throwing a punch, which was precisely the *Cloud-Soaring Technique*.

Just as Chen Ping’an thought he had escaped disaster and planned to spend the night admiring the moon, the old man unexpectedly knocked him and his sword down to the ground.

Then, with a light slap of his hand, he pressed down gently.

A powerful wind surged like a waterfall from the sky, sending Chen Ping’an, who had intended to continue riding the sword to fly, tumbling into the woods.

Chen Ping’an fell into a stream, splashing a large splash of water. The stream wasn’t deep; he staggered up from the water, sheathing his sword back behind him.

To his surprise, he saw Ruan Xiu squatting by the stream, gazing at him with a dreamy expression.

Chen Ping’an bent over, gasping for breath, wiped his face, and said helplessly, “What a coincidence. We meet again.”

Ruan Xiu nodded.

Just as Chen Ping’an was about to say something, he was inexplicably punched into the woods again, and a familiar voice roared, “You little brat, I knew you couldn’t resist! How long will this continue?! Are you addicted to thinking about my daughter? Even using a pity ploy?!”

Another punch flew in.

The entire stream was severed by the incoming punch.

Chen Ping’an could only continue drawing his sword, his intent connecting with it as he fled, barely escaping that punch, but danger loomed ahead.

With his heart racing, Chen Ping’an even used a talisman while frantically escaping, muttering to himself, “Just add Wei Ban, and we could set a table.”

From the corner of his eye, he spotted a white figure standing on the branch of a towering ancient tree, smiling down at him. “How embarrassing.”

Wei Ban’s voice was soft, yet Chen Ping’an heard it clearly.

He crashed into a ripple, and the next moment, he found himself standing atop the ethereal Peak of Clouds, feeling a sense of relief as he plopped down onto the ground.

Fortunately, Wei Ban didn’t take advantage of the situation.

On the other side of the stream, Ruan Qiong gently pressed down on Ruan Xiu’s shoulder before disappearing in an instant, returning to the Longquan Sword Sect.

Ruan Qiong personally prepared a late-night meal, and father and daughter sat across from each other, Ruan Xiu laughing brightly.

Ruan Qiong sighed inwardly.  
Today’s sadness is much better than the heartache to come.

On the Peak of Clouds, Wei Ban smiled as he bent down to help the exhausted Chen Ping’an to his feet.

Chen Ping’an forced a smile. “Tonight feels like a dream.”

Wei Ban chuckled softly and extended his palm.

Moments later, a blue bird, which had been flying through the cloud seas of the Peak of Clouds, suddenly fell into the hands of this divine being.

Wei Ban held the bird in one hand while with the other, he waved his sleeve, and a white cloud mat appeared behind Chen Ping’an.

Chen Ping’an sat cross-legged on the mat.

Wei Ban slightly raised his hand, sending the bird flying away back into the cloud sea.

Wei Ban spoke softly, “Chen Ping’an, based on a few letters you sent to the Peak of Clouds, and recalling Cui Dongshan’s casual conversation last time, I’ve pieced together a clue—a strange matter you might not even have noticed yourself.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “What’s strange about it?”

Ever since he learned Go from Cui Dongshan, especially during his time at the Shujian Lake, reviewing games had become one of Chen Ping’an’s daily tasks as the accountant.

Wei Ban gazed far into the distance, the cloud sea failing to obscure the vision of a mountain deity. The intertwined Longxu River and Tiefu River, further beyond, were the Xiu Hua River and Yu Ye River near Hong Zhu Town. Wei Ban slowly said, “The opportunity Ruan Xiu obtained in the Lizhu Cave Heaven was the fire dragon coiled around her wrist, right?”

Chen Ping’an nodded; this was an evident truth.

Wei Ban continued, “Since Mr. Qi gifted you the Mountain Water Seal, in the battle at Jiaolong Gorge, the Mountain Seal broke, leaving only the Water Seal. First, at the Xiu Hua River estate, you encountered a ghost in a wedding dress, and then at Tong Ye Continent, you encountered the Water God of the submerged river. In the territory of the Qing Luan Kingdom, before heading to the Lion Garden, you wrote an inscription on the wall of a water god temple. In Huang Ting Country’s Ziyang Mansion, you encountered the White Goose River Water God with ulterior motives. Regardless of good or ill fate, it remains fate. However, among the mountain spirits, apart from me, there are few, and in your mind, even if you pass by, they leave little impression, right? Especially these past few years at Shujian Lake. How long have you lived by the water? It’s not a short time, is it?”

Chen Ping’an pondered seriously for a moment before nodding.

“Have you forgotten who that little loach chose first back in the day?! It was you, Chen Ping’an, not Gu Can!”

Wei Ban smiled bitterly. “Have you ever considered that you’re so ‘close to water,’ while Ruan Xiu? The conflict of water and fire—could there be a more legitimate confrontation in the Dao?”

Chen Ping’an was taken aback.

Wei Ban sighed.

Suddenly, Chen Ping’an began to laugh, pointing behind him to the sword spirit. “Don’t worry, if there really comes to be a conflict of water and fire, I will yield to Miss Ruan. The reason is simple; I am a swordsman. My path in the Dao is on the journey of martial arts, wielding my sword and traveling afar, delivering the hardest punches, handing out the fastest swords, drinking with those who are reasonable, and using my fists and swords against injustices…”

A young man who almost became a ghost had never seemed so spirited over the years. “I hope that one day, when I, Chen Ping’an, stand in a certain place, reason will be there!”  

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 526: Not Acting Like the Good Fortune Boy

Wei Ba lifted his head to gaze at the sky, where a full moon hung high above. It was only after he became the Mountain Deity of the Divine Water Kingdom that he learned about the extraordinary phenomenon of two moons fighting for brilliance in another world. Even now, Wei Ba couldn’t fathom the tremendous differences in the laws and principles that governed that world compared to the vast and noble realm he inhabited.

Chen Ping'an took down his wine gourd and sipped, contemplating where to bury some of the fine wines he had treasured in his small items and pocket. He sought a spot on the Desolate Mountain that was rich in roots and blessed by flowing water. After counting, he realized he had quite a collection of wines.

There was the osmanthus wine brewed by Madam Gui from Old Dragon City, the well water wine from the Water Immortal of Fengwei, the crow’s cry wine from Shujian Lake, and the azure flower wine gifted by the Water Goddess of the Underflow River, of which he still had more than half a jar. However, it should now be referred to as the Azure Flower Water God Palace. Then, the alluring wine from Wu Yi of Ziyang Palace, and the yellow vine wine, also known as the meal-enhancing wine, produced in the hometown of Hong Su Island. Chen Ping'an found it mellow and easy to drink. Back then, thinking of his hometown, where Pei Qian and a girl in a pink skirt would have a couple of cups during the festivals, he had specifically bought a batch of aged brews. After all, they were common tavern drinks, not expensive.

Traveling the rivers and lakes with a book box, a sword, and wine-filled horse, one would never feel lonely.

The journey to North Junlu Continent, delayed for three years, could no longer be postponed. By the end of this year, he planned to visit the Colorful Garment Kingdom and the Combing Water Kingdom first, see some old friends, and then take an intercontinental ferry to that famous continent known for its sword cultivators and its emphasis on reasoning through martial arts.

Wei Ba withdrew his gaze, looking beyond the Desolate Mountain and Chess Stone Mountain, all the way to the south to the town of Red Candle. As a Mountain Deity, surveying his domain, the distance was clear; he could see every detail, from the Water God Temple in Red Candle Town to every passerby on the street, if he so desired. With the prosperity of Longquan County, Red Candle Town, as the confluence of the Embroidered River, Jade Liquid River, and the Flowing Water River, was becoming even more bustling.

In his youth, he had not recognized the moon, calling it a white jade plate.

The immortal dangles his feet; how round the osmanthus tree.

This used to be a fragment of a poem passed down from the ancient Shu Kingdom, later becoming a folk song in Red Candle Town, beloved by boatmen of all ages.

Though he was now a proper deity of the Northern Mountain of Great Li, the “lowborn” status of all the boatmen in Fushui Bay still could not be changed. Except for that woman who was already cultivating in Changan Palace, the descendants of the five surnames from the Divine Water Kingdom had been unable to escape their lowly status for generations, nailed down by the ironclad rule of “no stepping ashore.”

Wei Ba had looked after the five surnames in Fushui Bay for many years, yet after his rise, he had never even thought to plead with Great Li on their behalf.

After becoming the Mountain Deity of Great Li, Wei Ba had accomplished many significant deeds, including changing the household registration of the boatmen in Fushui Bay. Regardless of whether it succeeded or not, it was merely a matter of casually greeting the officials of the Ministry of Rites and the Capital’s Music Bureau. The outcome depended solely on whether the Minister of Rites and the National Teacher Cui Yan would nod in approval. Yet, Wei Ba had never even broached the subject.

After a long silence, Wei Ba smiled and said, “Chen Ping'an, we’ve talked about grand ambitions; shouldn’t we discuss some trivial matters now?”

Previously, when Wei Ba went to the gate of the Desolate Mountain to greet Chen Ping'an, their casual conversation was genuinely casual. Given that there was a Mountain Deity Temple on Desolate Mountain, it was evident that the Great Li court had a strong presence there, and the Song family of Great Li had made no attempt to hide this, representing a silent stance. If Wei Ba were to isolate a small world, he would inevitably attract suspicion of hiding something, and with the integrity of the Song Mountain Deity on the peak, who was loyal in life and a heroic spirit in death, it would surely be recorded and reported to the Ministry of Rites.

Better to avoid trouble than to seek it.

Chen Ping'an had already prepared his thoughts on this. He asked, “If signing the land lease with the Great Li court goes smoothly, which mountain should serve as the ancestral mountain for the Grand Master Hall? Desolate Mountain has the best foundation, but it is too remote, located at the southernmost end. Plus, I’m quite ignorant of geographical matters. I currently have two formations, their ranks... should be considered rather high. One is a sword formation, suitable for offense and repelling enemies, while the other is a mountain defense formation. Once established on the mountain, they are difficult to move. Should I place the two protective mountain formations on the same mountain peak from the start, or separate them and build them in a north-south pairing? However, there’s another issue: I currently have the formation diagrams and enough immortal money, but I still lack two crucial central items. So, even if I can set them up soon, they would just be empty shells.”

Wei Ba, unreserved, asked straightforwardly, “What do you mean by high rank? Is there a specific measure?”

Chen Ping'an smiled and replied, “Besides the jade token given to me by Zheng Dafu, I also have a phoenix leaf from Tongye Sect, which is also a precious item. However, I was advised to keep it closed when I received it, so I’ve never opened it all these years. Inside, aside from a heap of Guyu money drawn from Tongye Sect, the most crucial items are two precious formation diagrams for the protective mountain formations: one mimicking the offensive sword formation of Taiping Mountain in Tongye Continent, and the other replicating the defensive mountain formation of Fuqi Sect. The Guyu money is sufficient to cover the cost of constructing both formations and can sustain their operation for a hundred years.”

Chen Ping'an chuckled and continued, “However, the central items needed to support the operation of the two formations are nine superior swords and five golden body puppets. I need to search for them myself by chance, or I could buy them with immortal money, but I estimate that even if I run into someone selling these categories, they would be exorbitantly priced. The Guyu money within the phoenix leaf might run out too. Even if I manage to construct two complete protective mountain formations, I might still have to sell my possessions to fund their operation, just to avoid leaving the formations idle. Thinking about this makes me ache; I’m really forced to go searching for opportunities in those broken cave heavens or venture into dangerous and mysterious areas like those wild cultivators.”

After speaking, Chen Ping'an glanced at Wei Ba.

Wei Ba nodded and said, “There won’t be any prying eyes.”

Only then did Chen Ping'an produce the yellowed phoenix leaf. It looked ordinary, but if a cultivator examined it closely, they would find that this small leaf held profound mysteries and countless wonders.

Chen Ping'an handed it to Wei Ba, whispering, “The reason I’ve been reluctant to open it is that inside are two fragments of the Glazed Golden Body that fell after Du Mao’s failed ascension, one as small as a thumb and the other as large as a child’s fist. Compared to the other fragments that fell from Du Mao into the territories of Tongye and Baoping, these are considered small. Opening it would be tantamount to leaking heavenly secrets, possibly attracting the covetous eyes of upper realm cultivators.”

Wei Ba pinched the phoenix leaf with two fingers, raising it high and squinting to look at it. He sighed, “Fortunately, you didn’t open it. Fragments of the Glazed Golden Body from ascended realm cultivators are worth a fortune. Not to mention others, even I am coveting it. Look at this—just the veins of this phoenix leaf have gradually seeped out a golden and jade hue over the years. If you had opened it, what would have happened? You should know that many yin-yang cultivators rely on divining heavenly secrets to sell to great cultivators, earning Guyu money. So, by resisting the temptation to look, you have avoided countless unexpected troubles.”

Wei Ba admired the phoenix leaf for a moment before returning it to Chen Ping'an, explaining, “This phoenix leaf likely comes from the root of the central object in Tongye Continent. It’s said that big trees attract wind, but that ancient phoenix tree, whose location is unknown to anyone, hardly sheds leaves. It has remained green for ten thousand years, gathering the fortunes of the region. Thus, every fallen leaf or snapped branch is incredibly precious. For cultivators across a continent, each time a leaf falls, it represents a grand opportunity. In the dark, it can grant them protection from Tongye Continent, which people refer to as blessings and hidden virtues. Remember the small bamboo grove I carefully nurtured on Chess Stone Mountain?”

Chen Ping'an nodded and smiled.

Of course, he remembered. Even now, he was still hoping to ask Wei Ba for a bamboo pole to craft a bamboo sword for both himself and Pei Qian, one large and one small. If the bamboo was big enough, he could even make Pei Qian a bamboo sword.

With Wei Ba, Chen Ping'an had no qualms.

Wei Ba’s bamboo grove on Chess Stone Mountain was actually just a descendant of one of the ten virtues bamboos, known across the nine continents. The ancestor bamboo of the courageous bamboo, one of the ten celestial bamboos, was what it was. Back then, when he cut the bamboo for A Liang, aside from turning some into bamboo boxes and carving others into bamboo slips, the bulk of it ended up in the bamboo house on Desolate Mountain. However, the latter’s existence was due to Wei Ba’s own willingness. The courageous bamboo perfectly aligned with a saying of the sage of the martial arts, “The might of soldiers rises, like breaking bamboo; after several sections, it opens up effortlessly.” Building a house with this bamboo would be of utmost benefit to pure martial artists and military cultivators. Later, Li Xisheng filled the exterior of the bamboo house with runes, and it was no surprise that the barefoot old man spent almost all year meditating on the second floor of the bamboo house.

Looking back, Wei Ba had indeed made a profitable trade, earning himself the title of the Mountain Deity of Great Li’s Northern Region.

Chen Ping'an realized after passing Shujian Lake that to conduct business sincerely and naturally, without a trace of mercenary or foul odors, and to forge relationships as gentlemanly exchanges, was the true skill and timing in navigating the world.

Wei Ba was unaware that he would soon be giving up more than he anticipated; perhaps this was what they called "family thieves are hard to guard against."

This Mountain Deity of Great Li was still there explaining to Chen Ping'an why that phoenix leaf was precious, “You must take good care of it. To put it bluntly, if you walk in Great Li, having a peace-and-prosperity token as a middle-stage cultivator makes all the difference. When you return to Tongye Continent in the future, whether or not you carry this leaf will also be a world of difference. If it weren’t for knowing your mind is set and that there are great enemies in Tongye, I would have advised you to bypass Tongye Sect and head directly to the southern part of Tongye Continent to take a chance.”

“I won’t be going to Tongye Continent for now. As for the reason, it’s not just because of Du Mao and Tongye Sect.”

Chen Ping'an hesitated but eventually shared the detailed story about Su Yi going to Yuguizong, transitioning from a pure martial artist to a sword cultivator, and about Li Fuzhu following along. 

The establishment of Yuguizong’s branch in Baoping Continent’s Shujian Lake was now widely known.

But this was the first time Chen Ping'an revealed his relationship with the elder with the surname Xun and Jiang Shangzhen, as he had been wary of sending messages via flying swords between Piyun Mountain and Hongxia Island.

After listening, Wei Ba was momentarily taken aback, pondering for a moment before frowning, “Yuguizong must be trying to make a good impression on the Confucian Temple in Central Land with this opportunity, but they don’t wish to tear their relationship with the line of the Sage of Literature. So, they had that great cultivator who switched from Tongye Sect join as a scout instead of sending Jiang Shangzhen, their own person, to rush to Shujian Lake to kill you. They have their scapegoat. Not killing you allows them to make a move, offering an explanation to the semi-saint line, ensuring they don’t waste the support they received for establishing the branch of Yuguizong. That great master of Tongye Sect is not foolish either; they don’t want to be used as a knife. They quietly sent out the nascent infant cultivator Li Fuzhu, who, though not as accomplished, isn’t dumb either. She followed you all the way and only decided to reveal herself to act in a play with you in Meijiu Kingdom.”

Wei Ba then recounted the various behind-the-scenes rules between the main sects and their branches to Chen Ping'an.

Finally, Chen Ping'an understood.

Why Yuguizong was so unpredictable, from the elder with the surname Xun appearing in Old Dragon City to Jiang Shangzhen, and finally to Gong Liudao, showed no regard for “affinity.” 

It turned out that it all involved the great enterprise of the sect.

Chen Ping'an shook his wine gourd, feeling a sense of regret and losing his desire to drink.

He had no idea what role the elder with the surname Xun and Jiang Shangzhen played in this scheme.

Currently, the one who knew the most about the specifics of the mountains in the western Longquan County was undoubtedly Wei Ba. Transferring the fortunes of mountains and waters was no difficulty, but returning to Chen Ping'an's initial question of where to build the two protective mountain formations and when to break ground, Wei Ba’s expression was not relaxed. He slowly said, “These two formations are of extremely high rank and require considerable resources. Since you currently lack key items, unless you are in a hurry, I suggest you hold off on making a decision. The matter of protective mountain formations is of utmost importance for all cultivators establishing sects. It’s best to solidify everything before constructing the formations, rather than doing it piecemeal.”

Wei Ba smiled, “In any case, with me in Longquan County now, you need not worry about those mountains for the time being. If it truly comes to it, we can always add a Saint Ruan, right?”

Chen Ping'an felt a headache coming on.

After joking, Wei Ba continued discussing serious matters, “It’s hard to find a skilled expert in formations and mechanisms on Baoping Continent, but we have plenty in Great Li. This matter can be prepared early to avoid a flurry at the last minute. These two formations are not something ordinary formation cultivators dare to take on. You must finalize your candidates as soon as possible and coordinate the timing, instead of fixing a date first and then finding someone. So, you can look for an opportunity soon to contact that heroic figure, Xu Ruo. This person holds significant weight behind the scenes in Great Li. I can reach out to him for you; otherwise, you might struggle to find him.”

Wei Ba seemed to worry that Chen Ping'an was too hasty, wanting to complete the formations before heading to North Junlu Continent so he could travel freely, and patiently reminded him, “On the path of cultivation, the great way is long. There are many opportunities to seize, while some good things require patience. You must not let the unbearable waiting for the Shujian Lake journey make you feel that all time in the world is like this... slow.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I understand this principle.”

Wei Ba smiled, “Fortunately, I thought I’d have to talk you into it.”

Chen Ping'an helplessly said, “To be honest, I really do want a decent mountain peak—spacious and grand, where I can feel at ease whether I’m on the peak or thousands of miles away. That’s something... that makes me happy just thinking about it. But since you’ve said this, I can only hold it in and take it slow.”

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an laughed, placing the wine gourd at his waist, “Wei, Great Mountain God, I wonder if you have any spare courageous bamboo? Just one pole will do.”

Wei Ba smiled and asked, “Is this considered haggling?”

Chen Ping'an replied with a hint of disappointment, “I’ll pay whatever is due in immortal money, just put it on my tab in Piyun Mountain. I’m just thinking that since I’ve only recently returned and will soon leave Longquan County again, I feel a bit guilty towards Pei Qian. I want to make her two bamboo swords as parting gifts, so she doesn’t cry.”

Wei Ba gave a thumbs up, “Helping you contact Xu Ruo is one thing.”

He then extended a finger, “Being brazen and asking for a pole of courageous bamboo is another matter.”

Finally, he raised a middle finger, “Come on, let’s make it a trio.”

“There really is.” 

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “I only have a bag of golden essence copper coins left, which I need to reserve for the four people in the scroll. My法袍 (fa pao) made of golden essence can be enhanced by throwing in golden essence copper coins. Someone once said that it’s best to aim for a semi-immortal weapon rank in one go; I certainly won’t lose out, even if in the future I ascend to the golden body realm, it would just be a burden. At worst, I could sell it off for a fortune. But according to the current practices in Great Li, once I’ve purchased those mountain peaks, all debts of golden essence copper coins will be cleared. I’m just hoping that Wei, Great Mountain God, can work hard to squeeze out a few bags of golden essence copper coins for me. If all else fails, I’ll just consider it a debt to the Great Li court.”

Wei Ba’s smile was radiant as he asked, “May I inquire if this young hero Chen accidentally left his face somewhere in the corners of the rivers and lakes and forgot to pick it up on the way back to Longquan County?”

Chen Ping'an replied with a serious expression, “Look at what you’re saying; it’s secondary to hurt feelings, but the key is that it doesn’t seem to fit the demeanor of an immortal, which is unacceptable.”

Wei Ba rubbed his forehead, “Chen Ping'an, you’re actually the master of flattery for Mr. Zhu and Pei Qian, aren’t you?”

Chen Ping'an quietly awaited further commentary.

Wei Ba thought for a moment, “One bamboo pole is fine; I could just give it to you as a gift for that little girl. But asking for more bags of golden essence copper coins from Great Li is a different matter. The matter itself may not seem significant, but suddenly raising the price could disrupt business rules, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this.”

Chen Ping'an smiled and clasped his fists.

Wei Ba then said seriously, “Chen Ping'an, don’t think I’m making a big deal out of a small matter. Whether as a mountain deity or a mountain cultivator, some rules, no matter how trivial they seem, are fundamental. They may appear inconsequential and even seem to have no consequences if trampled on, but in reality, you should respect them even more.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I once thought about this when I was the steward at Shujian Lake, and later during my travels, I’ve gained some insights regarding this matter.”

Only then did Wei Ba return to his normal expression, looking a bit pained, “What a workload you’re creating.”

Wei Ba turned his gaze toward Desolate Mountain, smiling, “Looks like we have visitors at Desolate Mountain again.”

Chen Ping'an felt a tightening in his heart, fearing that Ruan Qiong might still be upset and charge up the mountain directly.

Wei Ba pressed down on Chen Ping'an’s shoulder, laughing, “I can tell at a glance.”

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an said, “Wait a moment.”

Wei Ba halted, feigning indignation, “Is there something else? Chen Ping'an, this is too much!”

Chen Ping'an teased, “It’s easy to invite a deity, but hard to send them off.”

Wei Ba rubbed his face with both hands, “Come on, let’s have a grand celebration.”

Chen Ping'an took out the phoenix leaf again and from his space, produced the jade token that represented the accompanying sacred person, “I nurture the mighty righteous energy.”

Wei Ba glanced at the jade token and exclaimed, “This thing is incredibly hot.”

Chen Ping'an first handed over the jade token, smiling, “Just lending it to you for a hundred years, consider it the price for the courageous bamboo I’m buying from you.”

Wei Ba took the jade token without hesitation, laughing heartily, “That’s a great deal. Since you returned to Longquan County, I’ve been waiting for this line from you. With this jade token, my status as the Mountain Deity of Great Li’s Northern Region is solidified. Even if you give me half of Baoping Continent, I can ensure the stability of the mountains and waters in my domain, absolutely preventing any harm to my Wei Ba.”

Chen Ping'an then placed the phoenix leaf in Wei Ba’s hands, “The larger fragment of the Glazed Golden Body inside is a gift for you. I don’t feel safe carrying the phoenix leaf, so I’ll leave it on Piyun Mountain. After all, there’s no rush to build the two formations now.”

This truly surprised Wei Ba. A fragment the size of a child’s fist was given to him? 

This was a treasure that even upper realm cultivators would fight for.

This was something Wei Ba hadn’t even dared to imagine.

Even these pure golden fragments of the Glazed Body were of greater benefit to mountain deities than cultivators.

After a moment of contemplation, Wei Ba asked, “Since good things come in pairs, why not give me the remaining small fragment as well?”

Chen Ping'an raised a middle finger.

Wei Ba felt relieved, “It seems this was a result of careful consideration and you won’t regret it.”

Wei Ba carefully stored the phoenix leaf, praising Chen Ping'an as truly the Good Fortune Boy.

Chen Ping'an beamed with pride, “This is called giving the horse grass if you want it to run.”

Wei Ba shot a sideways glance at Chen Ping'an, “Are you really not regretting?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, a hint of daze in his expression as he gazed into the distance, hands tucked into his sleeves, showing signs of fatigue. “The journey to Shujian Lake, traveling alone, even the smallest movements feel like walking on eggshells. I don’t want to have to rely solely on myself back in my hometown one day; I want to take a break.”

Wei Ba remained silent for a moment before asking with a smile, “That fragment of Glazed Body, you originally wanted to give it to the Mountain Deity of Desolate Mountain, right? After all, it’s better to maintain good relationships with neighbors than far-off relatives.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “It seems I can save that for now.”

Wei Ba remarked, “That’s not very Good Fortune Boy-like.”

Chen Ping'an retorted, “I’m not a Good Fortune Boy!”

Wei Ba merely smiled in response.

Chen Ping'an then recalled something, asking, “By the way, are there any ferries at Niu Jiao Mountain going to the Colorful Garment Kingdom?”

Wei Ba nodded, “The Northern Mountain Deity still has some clout.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Next time, I want to start climbing from the foot of Piyun Mountain and take a good walk through it.”

Wei Ba said, “You can also visit Linlu Academy; you have a friend studying there.”

That friend was none other than Prince Gao Xuan of the Great Sui.

Chen Ping'an had a favorable impression of this person.

Wei Ba sighed, “Accumulating earth forms a mountain; with wind and rain, it rises. Chen Ping'an, you really can look forward to the future. Within the mountain peaks, Desolate Mountain, Gray Mist Mountain, Bai Jian Platform, and many other territories will have the likes of Teacher Cui, Cui Dongshan, Pei Qian, Zhu Lian, and many other cultivators. Within Great Li, there’s me, Wei Ba, Xu Ruo, Zheng Dafu, Gao Xuan, and numerous allies.”

Chen Ping'an smiled knowingly.

After enduring many difficulties in life, one often finds a glimmer of hope after the darkness.

Wei Ba pressed down on Chen Ping'an’s shoulder again, “Don’t keep our guests waiting.”

With a gentle push, Chen Ping'an disappeared from Piyun Mountain.

Wei Ba remained on the mountain peak, with Piyun Mountain towering high, its clouds and oceans seeming to reach the heavens, level with the moon.

Looking out, the view was magnificent.

Under the moon, the heavenly mirror flew, and clouds formed a sea tower.

Chen Ping'an stumbled, taking a step forward as if entering a realm of glazed colors, feeling a slight dizziness. Upon focusing, he found himself at the foot of Desolate Mountain.

Chen Ping'an had long been accustomed to this. Back in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, this was a common occurrence.

This was a form of “wading through water,” where water represented the long river of time.

The earth immortals or mountain deities’ ability to shorten distances was the most delicate form of competing with the river of time.

As for the current shortening of distances, it was said to pale in comparison to the ancient immortals and divine beings who could move mountains and cross seas. There had been ancient texts that stated, “Shortening the earth leads to the yellow spring, ascending to the heavens, approaching the celestial palace,” what a carefree existence that was. These were merely the careless words of Cui Dongshan in his early years. As for Cui Yan's so-called moving mountains and crossing seas, Chen Ping'an had not given it much thought at the time. It was only after purchasing that book on the inverted mountain that he realized that there was no concept of three mountains and four seas in the vast realm. Later, when he reunited with Cui Dongshan in the southeast of Baoping Continent, while playing chess, Chen Ping'an casually asked about this, and Cui Dongshan merely chuckled, saying it was all old history and did not pursue the topic further.

Chen Ping'an noticed a hunchbacked man chewing on a blade of grass.

The man also saw Chen Ping'an and exclaimed, “Well, well, moving mountains and shortening distances. What, are you tired of that golden-headed fellow and want to be the Mountain Deity of Desolate Mountain yourself?”

Chen Ping'an helplessly replied, “That’s Wei Ba’s ability; I don’t have that kind of skill.”

Chen Ping'an’s posture was relaxed and natural, hands tucked in his sleeves. “Shall we take a walk?”

Zheng Dafu glanced at Chen Ping'an, noticing that after a few years apart, he had lost probably ten to twenty pounds and had likely grown a bit taller. However, he was now slouching, making him appear less tall.

Zheng Dafu remarked, “It seems after leaving Old Dragon City, Su Yi’s abilities have improved.”

Chen Ping'an was puzzled, “What do you mean by that?”

Zheng Dafu spoke gravely, “Young people often lack restraint. If you’ve hurt your essence somewhere, you’ll surely lack energy, your marrow will be exhausted, and you’ll have trouble bending and straightening. I’m certain you’ve been lacking strength lately and can’t practice your punches. When you go back to that old man’s medicine shop, you should grab a few prescriptions to replenish your body. If that doesn’t work, ask Wei Ba for a technique in harmony; otherwise, when you find Su Yi, you’ll be at a disadvantage, and it’s embarrassing for a man to be outdone by a woman.”

Chen Ping'an finally understood Zheng Dafu’s implication. With Zheng Dafu's temperament, such taunts would only spur him on. If Su Yi were here, Zheng Dafu would probably get a sword in return.

Chen Ping'an recalled a saying from Daoism, smiling as he said, “The great way is clear and empty; how could such a thing happen?”

Zheng Dafu scoffed at this.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Has your master taken on two new disciples? I’ve met them. That girl seems to be like you and Li Er, a pure martial artist, but why does that boy from Taoye Alley seem not to be pursuing the martial path?”

Zheng Dafu shook his head, “Who knows what that old man thinks. I don’t even know how many brothers and sisters have scattered across the land besides Li Er. Can you believe that? The old man never likes to talk about it.”

Chen Ping'an asked, “What are your plans now?”

Zheng Dafu had a matter-of-fact expression, “Isn’t it obvious? I’m just keeping my eyes peeled for a wife. I’m practically itching to run around the streets with a lantern at night to pick up a girl. Do you think being single is fun? The long nights are filled with nothing but the sound of roosters crowing and dogs barking, and I can only hold back my farts under the covers, reluctant to let them escape. If you were in my shoes, wouldn’t you feel pitiful?”

Chen Ping'an wiped his face and remained silent.

Zheng Dafu chuckled and said, “I want to discuss something with you.”

Chen Ping'an was curious, “What is it?”

Zheng Dafu pointed behind him at the foot of Desolate Mountain, “I plan to get back into my old profession and watch over the mountain, mooching off you for food and drink. How does that sound?”

Chen Ping'an paused, “You’re not joking, are you?”

Zheng Dafu grew angry, “Why would I travel all night just to joke with you at Desolate Mountain?”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Alright, I’ll have Zhu Lian build a house at the mountain gate.”

Zheng Dafu rolled his eyes, “There needs to be one on the mountain too. Otherwise, if this gets out, I’ll be the laughingstock and won’t be able to find a wife.”

Chen Ping'an looked around and leaned closer to Zheng Dafu to whisper.

After hearing this, Zheng Dafu quickly wiped his mouth and grinned, “Isn’t this a bit inappropriate? It wouldn’t look good if that got out, and I’m still single. Besides, you’ve already given a gift to that girl in the pink skirt. Isn’t it a bit inappropriate to ask for another girl’s?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “You said this, so don’t be jealous if you leave the mountain unattended and spend all your time wandering around.”

Zheng Dafu grabbed Chen Ping'an’s arm, “Hey, can’t I be a little shy? You know I have a thin face; after wandering the rivers and lakes for so long, my perceptiveness hasn’t improved at all.”

Chen Ping'an rubbed his chin, “Forget it. I won’t ask for that fox-fur talisman from the girl in the pink skirt anymore. I’ll find someone to help you buy another one in Qingfeng City.”

Zheng Dafu nodded vigorously, suddenly catching on to something, and tentatively asked, “Wait, what do you mean? You won't cover the cost of the talisman?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Of course I will. I’ll consider it an advance payment for your guarding the mountain.”

Zheng Dafu was suddenly agitated.

Chen Ping'an’s expression turned serious. “If you truly want a peaceful place to settle down, beyond Desolate Mountain, there are actually quite a few peaks—Gray Mist Mountain, Aoyuxi Back, Bai Jian Platform—pick any one.”

Zheng Dafu shook his head, “Watching the gate is nothing to be ashamed of. If I really feel like I’ve fallen in life and need to hide away, why would I come to Longquan County?”

Zheng Dafu patted Chen Ping'an’s shoulder, walking slowly and gazing up at the peak of Desolate Mountain, “This place has a human touch; I like it. The small town back then had it too, but after it fell from a small cave heaven to a blessed land, losing its restrictions, the land seemed to come alive. People come and go, mixing in with each other, and it just looks lively, yet it’s lost its warmth.”

Chen Ping'an had felt this during his recent return to Longquan County when he passed through the small town, but he didn’t express his thoughts as directly as Zheng Dafu did.

Zheng Dafu said, “If one day I feel that Desolate Mountain has become like that, I’ll move. Don’t blame me for not saying goodbye.”

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, “But it might be better to say goodbye before you leave?”

Zheng Dafu didn’t provide a definite answer. Suddenly, he reached out and slapped Chen Ping'an on the back, “Don’t bend over deliberately. Are you tired? What if I’m hunchbacked? I’m still handsome!”

Chen Ping'an tried to squeeze a smile but couldn’t manage it.

That night, Zheng Dafu stayed in the house built by Zhu Lian. These two like-minded individuals only needed a couple of jars of wine and some side dishes, and they could probably chat through the night.

The thought of having Zhu Lian around made Chen Ping'an feel a bit more at ease regarding Zheng Dafu’s request to guard Desolate Mountain. 

He figured Zhu Lian wouldn’t hesitate to visit the foot of the mountain. Once the two started sharing drinks, Zheng Dafu would likely boast about being the celestial guard of the heavenly gates.

Returning to the bamboo house, the elder with the surname Cui was standing on the second floor, tugging at the corners of his mouth before turning to enter the room.

Chen Ping'an felt a chill run down his spine.

He climbed up to the second floor.

The elder was seated cross-legged in the room, teasing, “Aren’t you going to thank me for seeing you off and allowing you to enjoy a beautiful moonlit view?”

Chen Ping'an sat across from him, his expression stern, “I really can’t bring myself to speak insincerely.”

The elder nodded, “I understand. It’s been years without knocking you, and you’ve become bold.”

Chen Ping'an felt uneasy.

The elder scoffed, “Running away? Aren’t you afraid I’ll punch you straight to Shenshou Mountain and have Ruan Qiong smash you back to Desolate Mountain?”

Chen Ping'an’s forehead broke into a sweat.

The elder pulled out a letter from his sleeve and tossed it to Chen Ping'an, “Your student left this for you.”

Chen Ping'an caught it, but the elder’s fist was already on its way, and although Chen Ping'an was already somewhat aware, he was still caught off guard as he was sent crashing into the wall with a bang.

The elder冷笑道：“奇了怪哉，一個五境巔峰的武夫，還不如當年三境武夫來得機敏？難怪只能跟在別人屁股後頭吃灰。” 

Chen Ping'an gathered the letter into his space, unsheathed his sword from his back, removed his boots, and his posture relaxed. His fists were loose, yet the energy was growing, and the joints in his body snapped like firecrackers, causing the dust around him to scatter.

If Zhu Lian were there, he would certainly be astonished and start buttering Chen Ping'an up, saying that he surpassed his teacher.

Because over these years, Chen Ping'an’s only “training” was Zhu Lian’s unique style of “Monkey Fist,” where the essence lay in “When the heavenly gate opens, spring thunders crack.” 

Though Chen Ping'an had not yet perfected it, he had already developed a striking resemblance to the Chen Ping'an from years of training.

Then, Chen Ping'an, using his Monkey Fist intent, assumed a stance taught to him by the national teacher of the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, forming the Great Dragon Fist posture, with a punching stance akin to the Iron Horse formation, “Come! If you’re capable, try to take me down using only your fifth realm!”

The elder slowly rose.

The bamboo house trembled, and the surrounding rich spiritual energy was scattered. A shadow in a green robe suddenly appeared, kneeing towards the elder’s head, who was still raising his head.

The elder casually extended a hand, pressing down on Chen Ping'an’s knee and, with a gentle push, tossed him away. The elder continued to rise at the same steady pace, neither increasing nor decreasing his speed, standing straight with calmness.

After being thrown, Chen Ping'an didn’t appear flustered. Instead, he lightly tapped his toes against the wall of the bamboo house, gracefully landing on the ground, frowning, “Sixth realm?”

The elder clearly thought little of answering such a childish question.

After a moment of contemplation, the elder mirrored Chen Ping'an’s actions, supporting his fist intent with the Monkey Fist while using the Great Dragon Fist to stabilize his stance, finally opening a path with the Iron Horse formation, smiling, “You’re asking for a lesson, aren’t you?”

Chen Ping'an slightly crouched, stepping back with both hands tracing arcs like flowing clouds, ultimately turning his palms into fists and striking an unusual pose that the elder had never seen before, “As long as it’s the fifth realm, I’m not afraid of you?!”

The elder said, “Oh?”

A punch was thrown.

Chen Ping'an fainted on the spot, able to utter only half a swear word.

Because that punch from the elder was clearly not from the fifth realm; it might even exceed the sixth, possibly reaching the seventh.

With one hand behind his back, the elder smiled, “Sorry, I didn’t hold back.”

It wasn’t that the elder intentionally mocked Chen Ping'an.

This was merely the truth.

Over these years, in this bamboo house filled with runes, he had been nurturing his once-unstoppable fist intent. Tonight, it had been slightly influenced by this little rascal’s fist intent. Even though the elder tried his best to suppress it, he still ended up exerting seventh realm strength.

The elder sighed inwardly, stepping out to the corridor.

Though returning to the last level of the tenth realm was a matter of time, the eleventh realm of martial artists he once deemed a sure thing was one he could no longer aspire to.

Back then, he had faced the sect master Lu Chen and had given up the chance to ascend to the eleventh realm to ensure the safety of two young people. Though he had no regrets, how could he not feel a twinge of disappointment?

The elder turned back to glance at the young man within, then withdrew his gaze. He thought for a moment and kicked Chen Ping'an, awakening him. Before Chen Ping'an could say anything, the elder kicked him on the forehead again, leaving him fainted once more. The elder muttered, “If you can’t reach the eleventh realm, I’ll beat you to death.”

The elder returned to the corridor, feeling refreshed, as if he had returned to the days when he locked his grandson in the study’s small attic and moved the ladder away. Every time that grandson achieved success, the elder would feel delighted but never express a word. Some of the truest sentiments, such as extreme disappointment or overwhelming joy, especially the latter, are often unspoken by elders to their hopeful juniors, like a jar of old wine placed in a coffin; once the elder departs, that jar will never see the light of day again.

What did the elder think of Chen Ping'an?

Pei Qian might not fully understand, and the little boy in the green jacket and the girl in the pink skirt might not truly grasp it either. Only Zhu Lian knew.

Thus, Zhu Lian wouldn’t think to ask the elder for martial arts guidance.

Some things are as precious as gems before one’s eyes.

At the summit of the mountains stood an elder and a youth, teaching and learning martial arts, and that was enough.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 527: Rain in the Alley (Part 1)

The commotion from the bamboo building was too great to ignore. When Pei Qian was startled awake, she quickly dressed and strapped on her sword, grabbing her walking staff before rushing out the door.

A girl in a pink skirt, who was half a step behind her, opened her door and caught sight of Pei Qian's nimble figure racing out of the courtyard. Noticing something was off, she hurried after her. Sure enough, she saw Pei Qian’s stern expression, filled with killing intent as she muttered under her breath while running. The girl in the pink skirt, familiar with Pei Qian's temperament, quickly called out, “Don’t be impulsive! Lord has trained on the mountain for years, and he’s always been like this.”

The girl wasn't unsympathetic to her lord's plight, but she understood the stakes and didn’t want Pei Qian to suffer any losses at the bamboo building. Moreover, Mr. Cui had no ill intentions toward their lord.

Pei Qian was fuming as she dashed forward, gripping her staff tightly. “That old bastard truly thinks he can rebel! This mountain belongs to my master, and the bamboo building is even more so! That old leech is shamelessly occupying the second floor! My master just arrived on the mountain and was knocked out by two or three punches! He barely opened his eyes after a chat with us before he got hit again, and now they're back for more! My master came to enjoy his hometown, not to be bullied by that old leech!”

The more Pei Qian spoke, the angrier she became, repeatedly exclaiming, “Infuriating! Infuriating!”

The girl in the pink skirt floated beside Pei Qian, her demeanor timid as she said, “If Mr. Cui really wants to rebel, there’s not much we can do. We can’t defeat him.”

Pei Qian spat to the side, not slowing her pace. Gritting her teeth, she declared, “Then no fighting! I’ll reason with that old bastard! I refuse to believe that such an unscrupulous guest exists in this world! Bullying my master because he’s easy to talk to? I, Pei Qian, am not to be trifled with! I’m the first disciple of my master and the senior sister of Cui Dongshan!”

The girl in the pink skirt drifted back slightly, glancing at the staff in Pei Qian’s hand and the bamboo sword at her waist, hesitating to speak.

Nearby, a young boy in a green outfit sat on a rooftop, yawning. This little scuffle was nothing compared to the time he had to carry a bloodied Chen Ping'an downstairs. The so-called “sparring” on the second floor of the bamboo building now felt like a gentle poem compared to the fierce battles of the past. Pei Qian was still too inexperienced in the martial world.

Zheng Dafeng and Zhu Lian were in the courtyard drinking and enjoying the moon, avoiding any mention of Chen Ping'an, instead chatting about women. It wouldn’t be appropriate for two grown men to talk about another man late at night.

Zhu Lian spoke of the alluring women of Tongyezhou, mentioning the Taoist priestess Huang Ting from Taiping Mountain, and a captivating woman named Yao Jinzhi from the Daqin Dynasty. He discussed Jin Su, a maid beside Madam Gui, and the temperamental Fan Junmao.

Zheng Dafeng shared stories about He Xiaoliang, who had defected from the Shengaosong sect, the unfortunate Su Jia, who had fallen into the muddy valley of Zhengyang Mountain, and a petite yet charming empress from the Dali court. The conversation meandered to his early days guarding the gate of Lizhu Dongtian, recalling the remarkable women from the small town, including Gu Shi from Mud Bottle Lane, and even further back, a woman from Apricot Blossom Lane who had become the river goddess of Longxu River, regaining her youthful beauty after becoming a deity. However, she had a sharp tongue and was fiercer in an argument than his sister-in-law.

Zheng Dafeng took a sip of wine, smacking his lips, his face filled with delight. “A clear moonlit night, drinking with a close friend, discussing beauties—this is truly a heavenly life.”

The set of celadon wine vessels on the table had seen some years; they were clearly produced by a dragon kiln in the small town and were nearly perfect. As a tribute to the Dali Song family, any slightly flawed products were rigorously filtered out and smashed, tossed onto Old Porcelain Mountain. Zheng Dafeng loved wine and was clever, managing to secretly acquire some porcelain that should have been reserved for the Dali royal palace. Such trivialities would hardly have caught the eye of Old Yang from the medicine shop back in the day.

Just as Zhu Lian was about to pour wine into the empty cup, he suddenly stopped, setting down the jug and lifting the cup to his ear, tilting his head to listen, squinting as he whispered, “In a wealthy household, one can occasionally hear the sound of porcelain cracking, not inferior to the cries of apricot blossoms in the market.”

After hearing that faint sound, Zhu Lian pinched the cup, murmuring, “A small vessel cracking sounds like a rustic girl discovering her feelings for the first time, fragrant as orchids. A large vessel cracking resembles a stunning beauty, riding with a whip in hand.”

Zheng Dafeng listened to these rather pretentious literary phrases, not feeling out of place at all; instead, he joined Zhu Lian in delight.

In theory, two old cooks should have been discussing trivial matters, not indulging in such lofty topics.

The bright moon shone brightly, and a gentle breeze wafted through the air.

The two sat across from each other, their hearts in sync.

Such is the beauty of the human experience.

Zheng Dafeng chuckled, “Zhu Lian, tell me honestly, during those years in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, did you ever truly like any girl?”

Zhu Lian gently set down his cup, sighing, “When one likes a girl, how can it not be sincere? How can one not be devoted? But in the world of family and martial arts, everything is beyond one’s control. When young, my ambitions were sky-high, always thinking that love and romance were trivial matters. Mastering the art of strategy and achieving greatness, leaving a name in history—when I read these words in books back then, it was like…”

Zheng Dafeng chimed in, “Like an old bachelor in the depths of the mountains, catching a glimpse of a beauty bathing, suddenly consumed by passion.”

Zhu Lian quickly filled their cups, and for such a statement, they should drink to their hearts’ content.

They lightly clinked their cups, and Zhu Lian downed his drink, wiping his mouth with a smile. “The sound of clinking cups with a close friend is even more enchanting than the sounds of a noblewoman bathing.”

Zheng Dafeng asked, “Such a heavenly sound, have you truly heard it?”

Zhu Lian nodded. “Just fleeting moments, all gone now.”

Zheng Dafeng was impressed, giving a thumbs-up. “A remarkable man!”

The young boy in green rolled his eyes, unable to comprehend how these two martial men, when together, would discuss women instead of martial arts or indulge in hearty meals. What good was it to talk about women, no matter how beautiful? A charming woman, no matter how lovely, could only bloom for so long. How long before age caught up? Even a beautiful woman from the mountain wouldn’t feed one’s hunger, nor could she buy treasures with divine money. The young boy thought these two were rather mundane and dull in their pursuits.

The key was that both Zheng Dafeng and Zhu Lian were outstanding martial artists from Baopingzhou, yet they both seemed to admire beauty without having a single enchanting figure by their side.

In the world of mundane pursuits, so-called martial masters, even those at the Sixth or Seventh Realms, could easily find a beautiful partner if they desired.

The young boy lay back, using his hands as a pillow, wondering why Chen Ping’an was able to befriend them.

And not just any friendship, but a true friendship.

Meanwhile, at the bamboo building, Pei Qian spotted an elderly man barefoot on the second-floor corridor.

The old man smiled and asked, “What’s this? Are you going to stand up for your master?”

Pei Qian blinked at him. “Old sir, we’re all heroes in this martial world, so we should value righteousness and be grateful, right?”

The old man remained silent.

He looked down at the black-haired girl who seemed to be a martial prodigy, puzzled why that young man inside was willing to neglect such a rare gem. Chen Ping’an, despite his flaws, should have been able to recognize Pei Qian's talent. How could he allow this lazy child to squander her potential, dreaming of mastering unparalleled swordsmanship overnight or becoming invincible in just two days?

Yet the girl had accepted Chen Ping’an as her master, showing unwavering loyalty. The old man felt it wouldn’t be appropriate to intervene; that was true martial ethics. Even if the little black-haired girl wasted her talent, the old man could only wait until Chen Ping’an returned to Laopo Mountain to discuss it. Ultimately, how Chen Ping’an chose to teach Pei Qian was their own business.

The old man said nothing.

The more Pei Qian thought about it, the less confident she felt. There was no way she could win a fight, and even summoning the old chef wouldn’t help. She blamed herself for not mastering the Frantic Devil Sword Technique; otherwise, how could that old leech be so arrogant? She would have made him kneel and apologize to her master.

However, Pei Qian felt particularly bold today and was unwilling to turn back.

The girl in the pink skirt tugged at Pei Qian’s sleeve, suggesting they should leave while they still could.

Pei Qian gently brushed her hand away, straightened her back, and declared loudly, “Old sir, let’s play a game of five-in-a-row. I’ll set the rules. Whoever wins gets to decide. Are you up for it?!”

The old man replied with a blank expression, “Not interested.”

Pei Qian was taken aback.

The old man suddenly remarked, “Is it only when your master is killed that you’ll practice hard? Then after a few days, when it gets too tough, you’ll give up and just visit your master’s parents’ graves like it’s a chore, feeling justified?”

Pei Qian’s eyes brimmed with tears as she pressed her lips tightly together, gripping the hilt of her sword.

At that moment, a figure clad in a blue robe swayed out of the house, leaning against the railing, waving at Pei Qian. “Go back to sleep. Don’t listen to him. Your master isn’t going to die.”

Pei Qian, on the verge of tears, asked, “What if he does?”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Then come upstairs. I’ll have him help you stretch your muscles and bones, just like when Sui Youbian was in Old Long City. Want to? I’ll count to three. If you don’t go back to sleep, I’ll take you upstairs. You won’t be able to run, and I won’t care about you anymore. Everything will be left to the old senior.”

Chen Ping’an had just counted to three when Pei Qian bolted, shouting as she ran, “There’s no what-if! What could possibly happen? My master is amazing!”

The old man snorted, “Your conscience isn’t worth much either.”

Chen Ping’an coughed a few times, his gaze gentle as he watched the two girls retreating. He smiled, “At this age, that’s already great. If we wish for more, then that’s on us.”

The old man shook his head. “If it were an ordinary disciple, being a little late wouldn’t matter. But Pei Qian is different. Such a good talent— the earlier she suffers, the greater her potential. At thirteen or fourteen, she’s not small anymore. If I remember correctly, you were already training in the Shaking Mountain Fist at her age.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Anyway, I’m Pei Qian’s master. What you say doesn’t count.”

The old man shot him a sidelong glance. “What, do you really plan to raise Pei Qian like a daughter? Think carefully about whether the Laopo Mountain needs an uncontrollable rich girl or a tenacious martial prodigy.”

Chen Ping’an rested his hands on the railing, “I don’t want to think about that. I just want Pei Qian, at her age, to do things she enjoys after doing so many things she doesn’t like—like copying books, practicing stances, and training with her sword. She’s already busy enough and isn’t really just idling away her time.”

The old man asked, “What’s going on with that girl’s eyes?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “After leaving the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, she’s been like this. It seems the old leader of the East Sea Daoist Temple did something to her eyes, but it should be a good thing.”

The old man wasn’t one to beat around the bush. After addressing that topic, regardless of whether he was satisfied with the answer, he quickly moved on to another question. “On this trip to Piyun Mountain, after your heart-to-heart, did you get a little careless and give Wei Bo a gift?”

Chen Ping’an felt a bit embarrassed but didn’t hide it, replying softly, “A piece of glazed gold body shard that fell to the mortal realm after Du Mao’s failed ascension.”

The old man, well-versed in worldly matters, asked bluntly, “How big?”

Chen Ping’an answered, “The size of a child’s fist.”

Chen Ping’an thought the old man would scold him for wasting money, but to his surprise, the old man nodded and said, “You can’t just owe Wei Bo a favor. Otherwise, in the future, the people of Laopo Mountain will be burdened in their hearts and won’t be able to hold their heads high in front of Piyun Mountain.”

The old man asked again, “Do you know why I knocked you to the creek in front of Ruan Xiu with two punches?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head.

The old man said, “Ruan Xiu followed Zhan Ganlang to Shujian Lake back in the day, you know?”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “Almost met her.”

The old man scoffed. “Do you know she killed a young man from Dali who was destined for greatness? Even Ruan Xiu herself didn’t quite realize that the boy was a candidate chosen by Prince Song Changjing. At that time, the situation was settled on Furong Mountain. The Golden Core Earth Immortal who had taken the boy away was already dead, the sect hall of Furong Mountain had been dismantled, wild cultivators had perished, yet Dali’s Zhan Ganlang remained unscathed. Think about it—why wasn’t that promising young man from Dali brought back?”

Chen Ping’an truly didn’t know this inside story and fell into deep thought.

The old man revealed some hidden truths. “The boy chosen by Song Changjing was undoubtedly a once-in-a-century martial genius. The reason Zhan Ganlang sought him out was that when he broke through in his early years, it caused numerous martial temple phenomena. Dali has always built its nation on martial prowess, and martial luck is undoubtedly of utmost importance. Even though Ruan Xiu helped Zhan Ganlang find three candidates later, it was still somewhat noted on Song Changjing’s end.”

Chen Ping’an questioned, “What does this have to do with me?”

The old man nearly threw another punch, wanting to knock some sense into this fellow.

Chen Ping’an, feeling a stir in his heart, had already shifted a few steps away, even naturally executing the six-step stance of the Shaking Mountain Fist.

The old man calmed slightly, refraining from striking again as he said, “You only strive for strength, not for martial luck. But does Ruan Xiu think the same? Every foolish girl in the world wishes for the man close to her to gain as many benefits as possible. To Ruan Xiu, if there’s a peer competing with you for martial luck, she’ll see it as a battle of the grand dao. What will she do? Kill you to eliminate the threat.”

Chen Ping’an’s expression darkened.

The old man placed one hand behind his back and rubbed the railing with the other. “I’m not trying to meddle in your affairs, but as someone who’s been around for a while, I hope you understand this: when you refuse a girl, you must know what she has done for you. If you understand that and still refuse her, being honest with her means it’s not your fault; it’s your ability, and it’s a testament to another girl’s good taste. But if you don’t understand anything and refuse just to satisfy your own conscience, appearing cold-hearted, it’s actually foolish.”

The old man turned to ask, “Do you understand this?”

Chen Ping’an nodded. “I understand.”

The old man then asked, “So what should you do?”

Chen Ping’an replied, “I don’t know.”

The old man raised an eyebrow.

Chen Ping’an sensed a dangerous shift and, with a flicker of movement, propelled himself off the railing, leaping out toward the bamboo building.

However, it wasn’t a straight trajectory. Suddenly, he executed a technique called the Thousand-Pound Drop, landing on the ground while using a spatial talisman, followed by a tap on his sword pouch, summoning his protective sword spirits. He stepped heavily groundward, moving like a galloping horse, riding atop the sword spirits, refusing to soar into the open sky but instead weaving tightly through the trees and swiftly fleeing.

It was a seamless escape plan he had clearly prepared in advance.

The old man on the second floor didn’t pursue him, saying, “If you had half this skill in dealing with love, you’d have Ruan Qiong inviting you for drinks by now, laughing and calling you her good son-in-law.” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 528: Rain on the Little Street (Part 2)

As night fell, the hour of the tiger was ending. Dawn was approaching.

Chen Ping'an sat alone on the steps near the peak of the Desolate Mountain. A drunken Zhu Lian climbed the steps and sat down on the step beside Chen Ping'an, turning to smile: "Young master, not being able to return home is indeed a bit tragic."

Chen Ping'an sighed, "It's my own doing; I can't blame anyone else."

Zhu Lian asked, "It’s almost dawn. If you’re not tired, why don’t we visit Longquan New County together? We could pick up that girl from the countryside who is now considered a half-disciple of Desolate Mountain. To be honest, it took a lot of talking for them to believe that I’m from Desolate Mountain, and I managed to convince them. However, that family has requested that someone in charge from Desolate Mountain show their face; otherwise, they won’t dare let their daughter leave home. So, it’s up to you to go personally."

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile, "Sure, we can pass by Windy Cool Mountain to the north. Let’s first check out Dong Shui Jing’s wonton shop before going to fetch her."

Zhu Lian chuckled, "We might even pass by the ancestral mountain of the Longquan Sword Sect."

Chen Ping'an playfully kicked Zhu Lian lightly. Zhu Lian didn’t dodge, taking it head-on, and exclaimed, "Oh, my old back!"

Chen Ping'an stood up and whistled, the sound resonating melodiously.

The unrestrained horse, the Yellow Curved, quickly came galloping over.

Chen Ping'an didn’t mount the horse but led it down the mountain slowly. He was accustomed to depending on the Yellow Curved as they traveled together.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Is Zheng Dafeng asleep?"

Zhu Lian rubbed his hands and smiled, "Not necessarily. I reckon Brother Dafeng is still lying in bed reading that book on immortals I lent him."

Chen Ping'an frowned, regretting having asked. He quickly changed the topic, "What’s the girl’s name from the county city?"

Zhu Lian replied, "Cen Yuangji."

Chen Ping'an remarked, "That’s quite a peculiar name."

Zhu Lian continued, "This young girl is quite tall, even taller than me. She appears slender, but upon closer inspection, you’ll find she’s just the right amount of plump—a natural model for clothing, especially with those long legs..."

Chen Ping'an helplessly said, "Are you picking a disciple for Desolate Mountain or a wife for yourself?"

Zhu Lian sighed, "I have the heart to kill thieves but lack the power to do so."

Chen Ping'an shot a glance at Zhu Lian, "You, a martial artist from the Far Journey realm, do you really believe that?"

Zhu Lian quickly amended, "I mean, I’m getting older and stronger—able to kill thieves, but I must maintain my integrity and have no intention of killing anyone."

Chen Ping'an stated, "When she arrives at Desolate Mountain, you and Zheng Dafeng should not scare her."

Zhu Lian laughed, "Young master, you underestimate Brother Dafeng and me. We are the finest gentlemen in the world."

Chen Ping'an halted, handing a small white jade plate to Zhu Lian. "I’ll go to the county city to fetch her myself; I remember the address. Give this small item to Zheng Dafeng; he knows how to open the mountain. It was originally given to me by him, and I haven’t re-refined it. Inside, there’s some wine, a few calligraphy scrolls, and various small antiques. You, Zhu Lian, are an expert. Discuss with Zheng Dafeng where each item should be hidden or placed. I trust your judgment."

Zhu Lian took the small jade plate, then turned to ascend the mountain, kindly reminding him, "Once you’ve picked up Cen Yuangji, don’t hurry back. It’s perfect weather for a stroll, take your time and enjoy the scenery. Just… be careful that Master Ruan doesn’t misunderstand you."

Chen Ping'an was about to ask Zhu Lian to accompany him to Longquan County, but the hunched old man vanished like a wisp of smoke in an instant.

Chen Ping'an led the horse down the mountain, feeling anxious.

Soon, one person and one horse trekked through mountains and rivers, much smoother than his earlier days of following Old Yao, enduring wind and rain, climbing mountains and crossing waters. Unless Chen Ping'an intentionally chose rugged paths in unclaimed mountain ranges, the journey was mostly on well-traveled roads. Each type of scenery had its own merits and demerits, and whether the sights were pleasing or unpleasant was hard to say.

At dusk, Chen Ping'an led the horse to the halfway point of Windy Cool Mountain, where he found the wonton shop and saw the now-taller Dong Shui Jing.

With a broad smile, Dong Shui Jing didn’t exchange many pleasantries. He simply said to wait a moment before heading to the back kitchen to personally boil a large bowl of wontons, bringing it to the table, then sitting beside Chen Ping'an to watch him savor every bite.

Chen Ping'an smiled and remarked, "Now, I can only hope the flavor of these wontons hasn’t changed; otherwise, the fields will have no one to cultivate them, and familiar faces in the town will grow fewer, with more strangers moving in, and tall buildings rising everywhere. Good and bad all mixed together."

Dong Shui Jing smiled without responding.

Aside from Mr. Qi and Li Er, this young man before him was one of the few who truly "respected" Dong Shui Jing during his early years. 

What was especially precious was that Chen Ping'an had traveled far with Lin Shouyi, while Dong Shui Jing had actively chosen to give up studying at the Dashi Academy. Logically speaking, Chen Ping'an and Lin Shouyi should have been closer, but when it came to Dong Shui Jing, their interactions remained simply genuine; he neither tried to curry favor nor was overly enthusiastic, nor did he look down on Dong Shui Jing for his humble beginnings.

Dong Shui Jing cherished that.

Just like the last time he returned home, Chen Ping'an and Dong Shui Jing chatted about the recent happenings in the Cliff Academy and shared interesting stories from their travels.

Dong Shui Jing also talked about his experiences in Windy Cool Mountain and Longquan County. After being apart for so long, their old stories mingled together in that bowl of wontons.

Upon hearing that Chen Ping'an was heading to Longquan County and that it would be his first visit, Dong Shui Jing decided to close shop a bit earlier. But thinking of the potential night travelers rushing down the mountain, he handed the keys to his staff before accompanying Chen Ping'an down Windy Cool Mountain toward the county city, where lights shone brightly as if it were daytime, creating a festive scene.

Dong Shui Jing then inquired about the situation of the Great Li Iron Cavalry moving south and the conditions in central Baoping Continent.

Chen Ping'an answered one by one.

Dong Shui Jing said softly, "After the chaos, opportunities for business are hidden within, but unfortunately, I lack the capital. I have no connections in the Great Li military either; otherwise, I’d want to make a trip south."

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, "I know a friend over at Book Scroll Lake named Guan Yiran, who is now a general and a rather decent scion. I can write a letter to introduce you both; you should hit it off."

Dong Shui Jing replied straightforwardly, "Sure, if it leads to a deal, just take a percentage from me."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "No problem."

Dong Shui Jing laughed, "I was worried you would refuse."

Chen Ping'an also chuckled, "Then how would we continue being friends?"

Dong Shui Jing hesitated, "If possible, I’d like to get involved in managing the immortal crossing left by the Horned Mountain’s Burdened Society. You can decide how to divide the profits. Just pressure me on the pricing; I’m not after immortal coins, but rather the news from those traveling passengers... Each piece of information is valuable. Chen Ping'an, I assure you, I will manage that crossing diligently and won’t slack off. You don’t need to worry about it. On one condition: if you can provide an estimate of the profits from that crossing, I’ll only take it if I can help you earn more. If not, I won’t mention it, and you needn’t feel guilty."

Chen Ping'an pondered, "Alright, I’ll discuss it with others and get back to you with a quote. Business is business; I won’t hold back."

Dong Shui Jing smiled, "You’ve been quite courteous already."

Chen Ping'an fell silent for a moment, then handed Dong Shui Jing a small flask containing a little bit of precious liquor he had kept hidden. He took off his Sword Nurturing Gourd, and they both drank. Chen Ping'an said, "Actually, I felt quite regretful that you didn’t go with us to Cliff Academy; I always thought we were similar, both coming from humble backgrounds. I had no opportunity to study back then, so I was a bit angry when you stayed in town. Of course, that was quite unreasonable. Looking back now, I see you’ve done very well. That’s why I could share these thoughts with you; otherwise, I’d have to keep them bottled up."

Dong Shui Jing took a sip of the liquor, "I know my own capabilities. My studies were passable but certainly couldn’t compare to Lin Shouyi. It’s better to do what I’m good at."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "You both like Li Huai’s sister so much."

Dong Shui Jing’s face turned slightly red; it was hard to tell if it was from the liquor or something else.

Dong Shui Jing drank a large gulp and whispered, "There’s one thing I’m sure I’m better at than Lin Shouyi now. If one day Li Liu, and both Lin Shouyi and I are not favored in her eyes, Lin Shouyi will surely be furious. I won’t be; as long as Li Liu is happy, I’ll still... feel a bit pleased. Of course, not overly pleased; it’s unnecessary to spout such nonsense. That would ruin this fine liquor in hand, but I believe I’d be more open-minded than Lin Shouyi."

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Dong Shui Jing raised his liquor flask, "Quite expensive, right?"

Chen Ping'an laughed, "Indeed, it’s not cheap."

Dong Shui Jing took a small sip, "Then it must taste better and better."

Chen Ping'an laughed heartily, "Just like me!"

The two like-minded fellow townsmen chatted casually as they walked northward.

Upon reaching the southern gate of Longquan County, the guards were inspecting the household registrations. Chen Ping'an had his documents with him, but when they saw Dong Shui Jing, he merely showed a token verification of his residence, and the small captain of the guards did not take it. He barely glanced, exchanged a few friendly words with Dong Shui Jing, and directly allowed the two to enter the city.

Chen Ping'an witnessed this silently, realizing that Dong Shui Jing was doing even better than he had imagined.

The county magistrate, Wu Yan, was a disciple of the national teacher, Cui Zhan, and a talented official from a noble family. The supervisor of the kiln was a scion of the Cao family. The county governor was a scion of the Yuan family. Even the mountain deity at the peak of Windy Cool Mountain was familiar with several wealthy figures in Longquan County.

It was surprising that a young man like Dong Shui Jing, who started as a wonton vendor, had established such connections.

Dong Shui Jing brought Chen Ping'an to the street where the family lived, then they parted ways. Dong Shui Jing mentioned his address, welcoming Chen Ping'an to visit whenever he had the chance.

Chen Ping'an looked at the tall figure of the young man, illuminated by the morning sun, bursting with vitality.

According to Dong Shui Jing, in Longquan County, just by observing which street one lived on, one could roughly gauge their wealth.

The street Chen Ping'an was on was called Jiaze Street, which was home to many well-off families from the Great Li, where they purchased homes. The land price was high, and the houses weren’t large, lacking in cost-effectiveness, which inevitably raised suspicions of living beyond one's means. Dong Shui Jing also mentioned that some even more prestigious streets to the north of Jiaze were home to the wealthiest families. The wealthiest was the mother of Gu Can from Niping Alley, who bought an entire block of properties. She wasn’t short of money, but since she came late, she couldn’t buy some of the prime real estate in the county, which was said to be managed by the county magistrate, hoping to buy a large residence on Dong Shui Jing’s street.

The woman had once taken a few maids to Windy Cool Mountain to pay respects and passed by Dong Shui Jing’s wonton shop. Hearing that he had once been to a school, she struck up a conversation with the young man. However, her arrogance in her words irritated the two staff at the shop, so Dong Shui Jing let her show off her wealth and even asked him if he had a place to stay in the county. She said she could help him inquire as she was familiar with the county magistrate. Dong Shui Jing simply said he had a place to stay; after all, he could feed himself without worrying about his family, and a smaller house was no problem. The woman’s gaze then turned to one of sympathy.

Later, a powerful official in charge of household registrations from the magistrate’s office came to Dong Shui Jing, asking if he could sell a large idle house, saying there was a wealthy woman from the Gu family who was willing to pay handsomely. This deal could earn quite a bit of silver. Dong Shui Jing simply declined, saying that a noble from the capital had taken a liking to the place, and he wouldn’t sell. 

The Gu family woman must have never imagined that despite offering such a high price, she wouldn’t be able to buy an idle house.

Now, in Longquan County, Dong Shui Jing’s wealth was steadily growing, and his connections were widening. However, strangely, the reputation of "Dong Bancheng" had become smaller and smaller. In just a year or two, it seemed that this prominent landlord had vanished from the county.

This actually showed that Dong Shui Jing was genuinely wealthy.

At the modest house, Chen Ping'an informed the doorman that he was from Desolate Mountain, named Chen Ping'an, and was here to pick up Cen Yuangji.

The doorman was skeptical, so Chen Ping'an had to present his verification documents. However, he didn’t hand them over, simply opening them slightly for the doorman to see his name and origin. Otherwise, the official seals from various countries would be too imposing.

Only then did the doorman go to report.

Soon, four people came to the door.

Seeing Chen Ping'an leading his horse outside, they hurriedly stepped over the threshold.

Three men and one woman stood together, a middle-aged man with two sons and a daughter. At first glance, they looked like a family. The middle-aged man was also quite handsome, the two brothers appeared to be five or six years apart, both exceptionally good-looking. According to Zhu Lian, the girl Cen Yuangji was only thirteen but stood tall and graceful, resembling a seventeen or eighteen-year-old woman, her features developing well. She bore some resemblance to Sui Youbian, but unlike Sui Youbian’s coolness, she had a touch of natural charm. It was no wonder that at such a young age, she had attracted unwanted attention and caused her family to move out of the capital.

Chen Ping'an introduced himself again, speaking in the Great Li dialect rather than the local Longquan dialect.

The middle-aged man cupped his hands in greeting, "Cen Zheng pays respects to Chen Xianshi from Desolate Mountain."

Straightening up, the man apologized, "This matter is significant; Cen Zheng cannot casually mention the name of the immortal master to the rest of the family."

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "It’s alright."

He turned to the girl, "Do you have anything you want to say to your family? Once we reach Desolate Mountain, you won’t be able to come down casually. Even correspondence will have to follow certain mountain customs. So if you have something to say, I can wait for you to finish."

Cen Yuangji shook her head.

Chen Ping'an led the horse and turned, "Then let’s go."

Without stepping inside for tea or reassuring the Cen family men, Chen Ping'an simply took the girl away down the street.

Upon reaching another street, Chen Ping'an finally spoke the first sentence, telling the girl to watch the horse and wait outside.

The girl silently nodded; this estate was called the Gu Residence.

Now, it was quite well-known in Longquan County, rumored to belong to a very wealthy woman with considerable connections in the Great Li.

Upon hearing "Chen Ping'an," the doorman quickly led the unremarkable young man in a green shirt directly into the residence.

Chen Ping'an met with the well-off woman, drank a cup of tea, and with her urging, he shared the experiences of Gu Can in the mountains south of Book Scroll Lake, which eased her worries considerably. Only after that did he rise to take his leave. The woman personally escorted him to the gate, and as Chen Ping'an led his horse away, she even stepped across the threshold, coming down the steps. Chen Ping'an smiled, saying, "Auntie, you really don’t need to see me off," before she finally relented.

A man and a woman gradually walked away, the woman glancing at the back of the unfamiliar girl, seemingly understanding something. She turned to glance back at the gate, where the beautiful maid she brought back from Qingxia Island was walking slowly, returning to the gate. She pinched the maid's ear and scolded, "Useless thing, you let a countryside girl outshine you."

The young maid was quite innocent, looking somewhat wronged.

Chen Ping'an led the girl named Cen Yuangji back south through the mountains, and along the way, there was no exchange of words.

The girl was secretly observing the "master of Desolate Mountain" described by the old immortal Zhu.

But no matter how she looked, she couldn’t discern his true nature.

She felt somewhat disappointed.

She had expected a celestial figure or a refined scholar, but who would have thought he would be a worn-down young man who seemed to be only a few years older than her.

Along the way, Chen Ping'an walked ahead, loosening the reins of the horse, repeatedly contemplating the contents of the letter Cui Dongshan had left him.

It was a significant matter, and some things could extend thousands of miles along certain threads, causing him to forget that a girl with poor stamina was following behind.

When Chen Ping'an came back to reality, they were already deep in the mountains, and he turned back to see the girl limping, her brow furrowed but remaining silent throughout.

Chen Ping'an stopped and turned, apologizing, "Sorry, I got lost in thought."

Cen Yuangji pursed her lips, still not speaking.

Inside, she felt indignant, thinking that this fellow must be deliberately using such clumsy tactics to pretend to be different from those lecherous scoundrels.

She had to be extra cautious! Once they reached Desolate Mountain, she would try to stay close to the old immortal Zhu and avoid falling into the clutches of this Chen Ping'an!

As long as she saw the old immortal, she should be safe.

Noticing her silence, Chen Ping'an had to ask, "Can you ride a horse?"

She shook her head.

Even if she could, she wouldn’t ride! Who knew if this seemingly honest yet slick rascal was taking the opportunity to sneak a peek at things that men would want to see?

People from the mountains were truly deep and cunning, much more so than the shallow-minded lechers from the capital.

The girl constantly warned herself, "Cen Yuangji, you must be careful!"

Chen Ping'an had no idea that the girl was so far off in her thoughts; he simply said, "Then let’s walk slower. If you want to rest, just let me know."

See? First, he acted like a villain, then came the tenderness; his tactics were endless and intricate.

The girl became even more certain that this guy was definitely not a good person.

Chen Ping'an felt that the girl’s gaze toward him held some strange meaning.

Turning around, he led the horse, rubbing his cheek. How did Zhu Lian see through it? Now that he was wandering the world, he had to be cautious about getting involved in romantic debts?

Chen Ping'an took off the Sword Nurturing Gourd and took a sip of liquor, hesitating whether to let Cen Yuangji go to Desolate Mountain alone while he made a trip to the medicine shop in town.

Upon seeing him drinking, the girl looked around at the desolate wilderness. She felt like crying—could this guy be planning to use his drunkenness as an excuse to commit some heinous act?

Chen Ping'an learned from experience, noticing the girl's uneven breathing and unsteady steps, so he turned back and indeed saw her pale face. He quickly put away the Sword Nurturing Gourd, saying, "Let’s take a break for a moment."

As soon as Cen Yuangji saw him finish drinking and put away the gourd, she really thought he was going to make a move.

She burst into tears, turned on her heel, and ran away haphazardly.

Chen Ping'an scratched his head, muttering, "Halfway through, and you miss home already?"

With a sigh, Chen Ping'an led the horse slowly, thinking that he couldn’t just leave her alone in the mountains. He was considering sending her home for a trip outside the mountains, and whenever she came to her senses, she could have her family accompany her to Desolate Mountain.

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to remind her to take it slow, he noticed Cen Yuangji stumble and fall flat on the ground, crying out loudly and repeatedly yelling not to come near her. Finally, she turned around, sat on the ground, and threw stones at Chen Ping'an while cursing him as a lecherous scoundrel, a shameless rogue, and swore she would fight him to the death, even as a ghost, she wouldn’t let him go...

Chen Ping'an squatted at a distance, holding his forehead.

He stood up and lightly stomped his foot, feeling helpless. "Wei Ban, lend me a hand! I know you’re watching, have you had enough of the show?"

In an instant.

Wei Ban, dressed in white with golden earrings, appeared gracefully, the mountain breeze swirling around him like flowing water.

Chen Ping'an no longer looked at the girl and said to Wei Ban, "Please take her to Desolate Mountain, and then send me to Pearl Mountain. This horse, the Yellow Curved, can also go to Desolate Mountain; it doesn’t need to follow me."

Wei Ban held back his laughter and snapped his fingers twice.

Chen Ping'an found himself alone on the peak of Pearl Mountain.

Wei Ban accompanied the deeply saddened girl to the foot of Desolate Mountain, and the Yellow Curved dashed away, heading up the mountain.

The mud-covered girl, still in shock and slightly dizzy, bent over and dry heaved.

Wei Ban didn’t even glance at her, looking up at the heights of Desolate Mountain, smiling, "Cen Yuangji, you’re quite unique to consider Chen Ping'an a rogue."

The girl took a few steps back, cautiously asking, "Who are you, sir?"

Ordinary people had no right to know the name of a great mountain deity from the Great Li.

However, Wei Ban just smiled without replying and began walking up the mountain first.

The girl hesitated for a moment, maintaining her distance, silently following behind the white-clad immortal.

Upon reaching the courtyard of Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafeng, Wei Ban gleefully recounted the incident. Zheng Dafeng laughed heartily, while Zhu Lian wiped his face, feeling distraught, thinking he was in for a rough time.

Seeing the familiar old immortal Zhu, Cen Yuangji finally felt at ease.

What puzzled her was why the three world-renowned experts had such diverse expressions.

Chen Ping'an descended Pearl Mountain and went to the town, and this time he was finally not turned away. He was led by a youth named Shi Ling Shan to the backyard.

Old Yang was sitting on the steps, puffing on a pipe, still there, clouding the air with smoke.

Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but wonder how long this scene had been going on—one hundred years? One thousand years? Or ten thousand years?

Back when he chose Desolate Mountain, why did this old man show that expression when Old Yao was mentioned?

Chen Ping'an had too many questions he wanted to ask this old man.

Because Old Yang must know the answers; it was just a matter of whether he was willing to share or if he was willing to make a deal.

But in the end, what Chen Ping'an said was simply, "What will happen to Zheng Dafeng in the future?"

Old Yang replied nonchalantly, "Let’s wait and see."

Chen Ping'an fell silent, simply sitting quietly.

The old man didn’t hurry him.

Eventually, a light drizzle began to fall, quickly increasing in intensity.

Chen Ping'an borrowed an umbrella from the reluctant youth at the medicine shop.

He stood under the eaves of the medicine shop, gazing for a long time at the deserted street, before stepping out into the rain.

 ### Chapter 529: Halfway Through the Ten-Year Agreement

After leaving the Yang family pharmacy, Chen Ping'an made a stop at the old academy, which had neither been abandoned nor put back into use. He stood outside, holding an umbrella, gazing through the window into the familiar space. 

The sounds of reading drifted into his ears, reminiscent of his childhood days spent crouching by the wall, listening to the teacher's lectures.

After leaving the academy, he visited the newly established Chen family's academy along Longwei Creek, which was far larger than the old one. Chen Ping'an halted outside the archway, then turned and walked away.

As he passed by a place commonly known in his hometown as the Crab Square, he looked up and strolled around, observing the four plaques inscribed by the sages: Confucianism's "Let It Be," Buddhism's "Do Not Seek Outside," Daoism's "Speak Naturally," and the Militarists' "The Energy to Charge at the Bull."

After the Ru Zhu Cave Heaven shattered and fell, it was meticulously inscribed by the Da Li Court using secret techniques, stripping away all the essence contained in the characters. As for which opportunities these would fall to, no one knew.

Gazing at the character "Xi," he recalled what Cui Dongshan had mentioned in his letter. Chen Ping'an's expression turned inscrutable as his thoughts drifted.

He then passed by the iron lock well, now privately owned and transformed into a forbidden area, where locals were prohibited from drawing water. A low fence surrounded it.

This reminded Chen Ping'an of the young man from Fengwei Ferry, a disciple of Liu Laocheng from Gongliu Island. This tall, gentle young man in black was not just someone Chen Ping'an thought well of; even Pei Qian regarded him as a good person, so he must truly be a good person. Later, Chen Ping'an had the courage to venture onto Gongliu Island, thanks to him. He felt that someone capable of teaching such a disciple as Liu Laocheng couldn't be completely corrupt. In retrospect, Chen Ping'an was right, but the scheming between him and Liu Laocheng still left him feeling uneasy.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an smiled. He didn't know why, but standing outside the well at this moment felt a bit like when he had gazed from a distance at the "Heaven's Gate" leading to the Sword Qi Great Wall while at the Upside Down Mountain. There, a swordsman sat atop a stone tablet, with a little Daoist boy reading on a mat. As Chen Ping'an traveled far and wide, he felt that the only place that could rival this little town in terms of hidden talents was likely the Upside Down Mountain, which stood as the largest mountain seal in the world of righteousness—a remarkable work by Daoist Lao Er.

Chen Ping'an looked up at the sky.

After retracting his gaze, he caught sight of the two temples dedicated to the ancestors of the Yuan and Cao families. One was located at Old Porcelain Mountain, and the other at Immortal Tomb, both of considerable significance.

Chen Ping'an did not approach the temples, especially the Old Porcelain Mountain one, which he had hardly visited since childhood. He kept his distance but lingered near the newly renovated Immortal Tomb, where many statues of Bodhisattvas and Heavenly Officials had been restored to their former glory by the skilled craftsmen of Da Li. Each statue was being carefully placed anew, though the work was not yet complete, with many workers bustling about on high wooden frames.

It was said that the Da Li Court intended to expand the Wenchang and Wudang Temples further, planning to house the Bodhisattvas and Daoist Heavenly Officials within a single shrine. Once completed, this county temple would become the most grand and spectacular Wenchang Temple in all of Da Li, sure to attract countless distinguished officials to offer incense and pay respects.

Originally, Chen Ping'an had entrusted Ruan Xiu to oversee the funding for the restoration of the statues and the construction of the shelters. However, it was soon handed over to the Da Li government, which then prohibited any private involvement. Among the three statues that had originally collapsed, Chen Ping'an had once tossed three golden coins into them. Although he was now in need of such items, he harbored no intention of pursuing clues. If they still existed, it would be fate—a bond of incense. If discovered by the local children or villagers, turning into their unexpected fortune would also be fate. However, Chen Ping'an felt this latter possibility was more likely, given that in recent years, locals had combed the mountains and rivers in search of ancestral treasures and heavenly materials, later selling them at the Niu Jiao Mountain's Paofu Studio to exchange for money, allowing them to buy grand homes in Longquan County and live lives they had once only dreamed of.

Chen Ping'an didn't see their actions as wrong; he simply thought they should wait a bit longer to sell. The prices would only rise. Even for the same immortal artifact, selling it a few years later could yield several times the profit.

Why did Paofu Studio, like the Xu family in Qingfeng City, initially choose to withdraw from Longquan County, abandoning a heavily invested immortal ferry to make a profit for the Da Li Song family?

At first, Chen Ping'an believed that Paofu Studio had made a poor bet, banking on the Zhu Ying Dynasty. However, it now appeared they had likely acquired too many town treasures at low prices, earning enough immortal money that even they felt uncomfortable with their gains. Hence, when the situation in the central region of Baopingzhou became clearer, Paofu Studio weighed the pros and cons and traded an immortal ferry for a protective talisman from Da Li's iron cavalry, extending their incense ties with the Da Li Song family. In the long run, Paofu Studio might end up profiting even more.

Chen Ping'an felt that this line of thought was likely the truth.

Engaging in underhanded dealings with the officials brought quick money, but it was fleeting and ultimately not the right path. As for how to engage in legitimate business, Chen Ping'an naturally had no idea. He assumed that figures like Sun Jiashu from Old Long City and Liu Chongrun from Zhu Chai Island would be more knowledgeable about the rules within. He would have the opportunity to ask them in the future.

The layout of the Immortal Tomb had changed significantly; upon returning to familiar ground, many places he wanted to visit were inaccessible, while places he had never been allowed to go were now adorned with pavilions and observation platforms.

Chen Ping'an rested in a little pavilion with upturned eaves.

Among the many assistants, there was a notable number of Lu family refugees who had migrated to Longquan County. Chen Ping'an had seen many convicts in the past, as they had worked on building the Mountain God Temple and maintaining the incense path. Compared to those days, the refugees now busying themselves at the Immortal Tomb were mostly young adults and teenagers. Although they remained quiet, they no longer bore the same despairing demeanor, likely having found small hopes amidst their long struggles.

Yu Lu, the deposed prince of the Lu dynasty, and Xie Xie, a favored one among the mountain's deities, could not be said to be merely fish that slipped through the net. They were pawns chosen by Cui Zhan and the Da Li Empress, the result of a behind-the-scenes deal, and had now become students at the Daisui Mountain Academy. Yu Lu had a good relationship with Gao Xuan, a bit like brothers in misfortune—one in exile, and the other serving as a hostage in enemy territory.

As for Xie Xie, he had indeed suffered greatly at the hands of Cui Dongshan in previous years.

However, just as the Cui family elder would not interfere in Chen Ping'an's and Pei Qian's matters, Chen Ping'an would not take advantage of being Cui Dongshan's "teacher" to meddle.

How to extend goodwill to others was a profound matter.

It wasn't enough to simply say, "I think..." to compensate for any negative consequences that may arise from well-intentioned actions going awry.

The place where he had fought against Ma Kuxuan had undergone a drastic transformation; outsiders could no longer enter. Wei Ban mentioned that during the day, one could freely visit the Immortal Tomb and Old Porcelain Mountain without restrictions, but at night, practitioners of Yin-Yang and Mo families would appear, setting up formations to manage the mountain's roots and water flow, making it unsuitable for nocturnal visits.

Chen Ping'an regretted not being able to return to that "battlefield" where he had fought Ma Kuxuan. Following a familiar route that often appeared in his dreams, he slowly walked along, stopping halfway to crouch down and scoop up some soil, lingering for a moment before continuing on to the swordsmith's shop that had not been relocated to Shenxiu Mountain. He heard it was run by a woman who had been expelled from the Wind and Snow Temple and had taken Liu Qiong as her master, practicing her skills while overseeing the "ancestral property." She had even cut off her own thumb, proving to Liu Qiong that she had severed ties with her past. 

Walking along the Longxu River, he knew he would not find a single Snake Heart Stone—the opportunities were fleeting. He still had a few high-quality Snake Heart Stones, five or six, if he recalled correctly, but ordinary ones, which had been plentiful, were now scarce.

Chen Ping'an did not return to Luopo Mountain immediately but instead crossed a stone arch bridge that had long since been dismantled. He sought out a small temple, which once had many names written on its walls, including his own, Liu Xianyang's, and Gu Can's. The three of them had crowded together, inscribing their names at the top in a blank space. The ladder they had used was stolen by Liu Xianyang, and the charcoal was brought by Gu Can from home. 

Upon reaching that spot, he found that the small temple for resting had vanished as if it had never existed, and he suddenly remembered that it had likely been taken under the wing of Old Yang. He wondered what significance lay within.

Returning to the banks of the Longxu River, Chen Ping'an followed the current downstream. The path across the river had been widened into one of Longquan County's main roads, which had once been the road he took when he first left home. Back then, he was accompanied only by a little girl in a red cotton coat.

He had cared for that girl as they traversed green mountains and clear waters.

Yet in truth, it was the girl who silently supported the mud-legged young man, allowing him to travel far and not give up.

Chen Ping'an passed by a water deity shrine that had been officially recognized by the Da Li Court. It had little incense, and its reputation was peculiar; it seemed to merely have a golden body and a temple, lacking even a decent plaque. Even now, few understood whether it was a river god temple or a river goddess shrine, while downstream, the Jiang Shen Temple of the Iron Fu River was grandly constructed. The townsfolk would rather walk over a hundred miles to offer incense and pray at that temple.

Of course, there was one more important reason: according to the elders of the town, the statue of that goddess bore an uncanny resemblance to a young woman from Xinghua Alley. The older folks, especially the elderly women from the streets, would never miss an opportunity to advise the younger generation not to burn incense there as it could attract evil spirits.

Chen Ping'an did not enter the shrine but continued onward, planning to reach the Jiang Shen Temple of the Iron Fu River.

Now, the Iron Fu River was one of the top rivers in Da Li, highly respected, which meant its ceremonial standards were considerably higher than those for the Xiuhua River and the Yuye River. If Longquan had not just become a county, the governor should have been a regional official personally coming here to worship the river god each year, praying for favorable weather and the absence of natural disasters. In contrast, for the Xiuhua and Yuye Rivers, it was sufficient for the local governor to visit the river god temple personally, and even if they occasionally had to delegate the task to subordinate officials due to pressing matters, it wasn't seen as an offense.

As Chen Ping'an moved further away, behind him, within that nameless shrine, a little clay statue of the goddess, with incense dwindling, rippled with energy, and a visage of a young woman emerged, appearing sorrowful and disheartened.

With few offerings, she couldn't help but complain about her plight, but after a moment's ranting, she lost the fervor she once had while cursing in Xinghua Alley—it was truly hunger that could cure all ailments.

Chen Ping'an quickened his pace, moving faster and faster.

Finally, he began to practice the six-step stance, having set aside the three stances of the Huan Mountain Sutra for three full years, feeling somewhat rusty.

According to the old Cui family's expertise, Chen Ping'an's current physical condition was a mixed bag. The good news was that he had the physique of a martial artist; after three years of silence at Shujian Lake, his foundational strength remained intact. The fire dragon from Beiju Luzhou had given him three pointers in the air, which greatly benefited him. Otherwise, he might have truly walked into Qingxia Island and laid down to leave Shujian Lake.

However, the path of cultivation was fraught with difficulties. After the shattering of that golden body artifact, the aftereffects were significant. The original creation of his Five Elements-based life item had been crucial for rebuilding the Changsheng Bridge.

The higher the rank, the greater the relation. After collapsing, the higher he climbed, the harder he fell. This was similar to what the old Cui family elder had witnessed time and again—the sword immortal's demeanor would leave large holes in Chen Ping'an's heart. Rebuilding after a shatter was increasingly difficult. Thus, quickly refining his third life item had become urgent.

Hence, in a letter left behind by Cui Dongshan in the bamboo tower, he changed his initial intention and suggested that Chen Ping'an choose the new Five Mountain soil from Da Li for his life item, even though Chen Ping'an had previously abandoned that idea. Cui Dongshan did not elaborate on the reason, merely asking Chen Ping'an to trust him once. As the "national teacher" of Da Li, once he absorbed the entire Baopingzhou and made it part of Da Li, he would surely have decided which five mountains to designate as the new Five Mountains long ago. For example, Da Li's own Longquan County, with Piyun Mountain being promoted as the Northern Mountain—there were hardly a handful of people in all of Da Li who knew about this, not even including the late emperor Song Zhengchun.

The Central Mountain was the former Central Mountain of the Zhu Ying Dynasty. Moreover, the mountain deity, who had to change allegiance due to prevailing circumstances, had still managed to maintain its temple's golden body, stepping forward to become the Central Mountain of the entire continent. As a return favor, this "unchanged" deity would need to help stabilize the new landscape's fortune for the Song family of Da Li. Any cultivators within the territory would not only receive protection from the Central Mountain but were also bound by its constraints. Otherwise, they should not blame the Da Li iron cavalry for turning against them and dealing with their golden body as well.

The Mo family hero Xu Ruo personally took charge of this matter, stationed near the Mountain Temple.

At that time, Liu Qiong would also leave Longquan County to go to the new Western Mountain, which wasn't too far from the Wind and Snow Temple. The new Western Mountain, named Ganzhou Mountain, had never been part of the local Five Mountains; this time, it marked a meteoric rise.

A group of Da Li's top offerings, mostly Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators, would head to the new Eastern Mountain called Qi Mountain, patrolling the borders to prevent the remnants of fallen countries from infiltrating, willing to risk their lives to destroy the local landscape.

As for the Southern Mountain, Fan Junmao would be the mountain god there.

Regarding the site selection for Da Li's new Southern Mountain, Cui Dongshan kept it a secret, saying that Chen Ping'an could wait and see, at which point he would understand what "Accumulating Soil to Form Mountains" truly meant.

Thus, Cui Dongshan candidly stated in his letter that he would take this opportunity to excavate soil from the other new Four Mountains early. Could matters related to scholars be considered theft? Moreover, even if Chen Ping'an ultimately remained unwilling to select the five-colored soil of the mountains as his next life item, he could at least collect a basket full of rare soil, which would still amount to a considerable sum of money. Since the current oversight was not strict, it would be a shame not to take advantage of it. As for Beiju Luzhou's Wei Ban, well, you and he shared the same interests, so why be polite?

Unbeknownst to Chen Ping'an, he had already arrived at the imposing Jiang Shen Temple.

The incense here was flourishing, unlike the declining River God Temple; even in the dead of night, over a thousand pilgrims waited outside, eagerly hoping to enter the temple to burn incense. After all, the population around Longquan County was still small, so once Longquan was elevated to a state, and the Da Li Court continued to migrate people here, the bustling scene at the Da Li Jiang Shen Temple could easily be imagined.

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment before stepping inside, where ancient cypress trees towered, most of which had been transplanted from the western mountains.

Upon reaching the main hall, Chen Ping'an crossed the threshold and lifted his gaze to the brightly painted clay statue of the goddess, towering four zhang high, lifelike and adorned with colorful ribbons as if she were about to ascend.

The height of a god's statue often indicated their rank within the country's celestial hierarchy.

For example, the shrine Chen Ping'an had passed earlier had a statue no taller than one zhang.

Chen Ping'an was aware of the temple's secret.

This river goddess was named Yang Hua, formerly a personal maid to the Da Li Empress. She once wielded an ancient sword with a golden tassel. However, for reasons unknown, she shed her mortal form and became a deity of this river, enduring immense suffering as she crafted her golden body. This event had attracted unusual phenomena, and her high-quality body led the Da Li Court to take her seriously, first promoting the river to a river god and subsequently elevating her to the highest position within the ranks of river deities.

Chen Ping'an neither offered incense nor performed any gestures of reverence. After lingering for a moment, he left the main hall and walked out of the vast temple, retracing his steps.

Throughout his visit, the Jiang Shen Temple remained quiet, save for the soft wafts of incense.

This time, Chen Ping'an did not bother Wei Ban. By the time he walked back to Luopo Mountain, it was already dusk the following day. Along the way, he had also visited several mountain peaks. Years ago, he had obtained several bags of golden copper coins, and Ruan Qiong had suggested he purchase mountain peaks. Chen Ping'an, armed with a geomantic map drawn by the kiln supervisor, traversed the mountains and ultimately selected five peaks, including Luopo Mountain and Zhenzhu Mountain. Reflecting on it now felt surreal.

After ascending the mountain, Chen Ping'an first stopped by the bamboo tower. After all, while the monk might have escaped, the temple could not. He couldn't hide from the elder every day; besides, even if the elder intended to hit him, he couldn't run away.

Chen Ping'an wrote several letters on the first floor, planning to send them to the Mountain Cliff Academy, Liu Zhimo and Gu Can at Qingxia Island, and the mountain villa of Song Yushao from the Shuishui Kingdom. Among the letters sent to Gu Can, he would also convey a message to Liu Chongrun from Zhu Chai Island. As for the flying sword communication to Liu Zhimo, he mentioned the situation of the female official Hong Su from the Spring Court.

Liu Zhimo had miraculously survived. He had not only emerged safely from the water prison of Gongliu Island but had also returned to Qingxia Island, transforming into a revered offering at the Yuguizong under Liu Laocheng's tutelage, ranking third. The many factions at Shujian Lake that had previously ganged up on Qingxia Island would likely be regretting their actions. As for the disciples and offerings on Qingxia Island, they would probably be facing repercussions, especially that clever person from Su Lin Island, Tian Hu Jun, who had plotted everything based on the premise that Liu Laocheng would perish.

Thus, the old saying about leaving a way out in human relations held a significant truth.

The last letter was addressed to Zhong Kui from Taiping Mountain on Tongye Island, needing to be sent to Old Long City first, then transmitted across the continent via flying sword. Other letters could easily reach the sword room at the ferry on Niu Jiao Mountain. As long as they weren’t heading to excessively remote places or mountains with weak influence, they would arrive smoothly. However, the sword room’s flying swords were now tightly controlled by the Da Li military, so he would still need to borrow Wei Ban’s influence. This was unavoidable; if it were Ruan Qiong, it wouldn’t require so much effort. After all, Luopo Mountain hadn’t yet gained sufficient influence.

After writing the letters, he found Pei Qian and Zhu Lian, asking them to take them to Niu Jiao Mountain.

Pei Qian was enthusiastic.

He wanted to call the little boy in blue and the little girl in pink to join him on the journey, believing that fun was better shared. 

However, Chen Ping'an stopped him, and Pei Qian had to head down the mountain with the old chef. He asked if he could take the horse named Qu Huang, to which Chen Ping'an agreed. Only then did Pei Qian swagger out of the courtyard.

He had thought that he would have to wait until his next adventure to ask his master for a little donkey, but unexpectedly, he could ride a fine horse now. He thought perhaps he wouldn’t need to roam the world anymore and could simply ride around Luopo Mountain. That would still count as wandering the world, without encountering so many unwelcome bad people. If he got hungry, he could run back to Luopo Mountain, where he wouldn't have to worry about food or clothing. Such a life was modest, but she really liked it.

Zheng Dafu was no longer on the mountain. He had said he was going to Longquan County to settle a few debts before coming to stay at Luopo Mountain. It seemed Zheng Dafu had racked up quite a tab at the taverns and inns and had borrowed money from Zhu Lian. As for when he would repay it, who knew?

The girl named Cen Yanji stood in the courtyard, at a loss, her face flushed, too shy to meet the gaze of the young master of Luopo Mountain.

Chen Ping'an, of course, didn’t mind the little misunderstanding. To be honest, he initially thought he was being overly sentimental, mistaking Zhu Lian's words. However, he soon received a blow of reality from the innocent girl, leaving him a bit disappointed.

It wasn't that Chen Ping'an had any ulterior motives, but what man wouldn’t like being handsome and likable?

Chen Ping'an also didn’t intentionally ignore Cen Yanji. He reiterated what he had mentioned earlier at the entrance to the Cen family in Longquan County: since she had come to Luopo Mountain to learn martial arts, there had to be rules. It was best to clarify everything with Zhu Lian first. As long as she acted within the rules, she could do and say whatever she wanted without hesitation. Even if she faced punishment in the future and felt she had done nothing wrong, she wouldn’t need to worry. She could come directly to Chen Ping'an to explain her side, and no one would stop her. As long as she made sense, he would recognize her reasoning.

Cen Yanji nodded, still not saying a word.

She felt both relieved and worried. She was relieved that Luopo Mountain was not a den of tigers and dragons, but worried that aside from Zhu Laojian, the young master, and the mountain lord's eldest disciple, along with the two little attendants in blue and pink, were quite different from what she had imagined of cultivators in the mountains. The only one who matched her impression of an immortal was "Wei Ban," but he was not even a cultivator on Luopo Mountain.

As for the old man named Shi Rou, he was taciturn and strange, looking quite eerie.

Cen Yanji sighed inwardly, deciding to focus on her martial arts training.

Chen Ping'an led the little boy in blue and the girl in pink toward the cliffside stone table near the bamboo tower.

The girl in pink sat beside Chen Ping'an, positioned to the north so she wouldn’t obstruct his view toward the south.

The boy in blue sat opposite him, and as soon as he reached out, the girl in pink took out a handful of sunflower seeds. Having spent so much time with Pei Qian, who loved snacking on them, she had become somewhat like a seed vendor.

Chen Ping'an said seriously, “You both still lack proper names, and that's not good. Luopo Mountain might have a sect in the future, and perhaps even a Patriarch Hall. However, keep your true names hidden well. I haven’t asked you in all these years, and I won’t in the future. Even if Luopo Mountain becomes a legitimate cultivation mountain, I won’t request your true names. I can assure you of that. In the future, if anyone talks too much, you can tell me, and I’ll discuss it with them. But names that can be recorded in the Patriarch Hall must exist, so do you have any preferred pseudonyms?”

For the spirits and monsters of mountains and rivers, their so-called true names must be carefully inscribed somewhere within their hearts.

Especially after taking on human form, such names were indispensable, akin to declaring their identity to the world, like a national title.

It was said that if a spirit or monster didn’t wish to be “registered,” they would be marginalized by the great Dao of the righteous world, facing numerous obstacles. Many spirits far removed from the human realm struggled to advance because they were unaware of this principle, leading to centuries of nameless wandering, slow progress, and not being recognized by the righteous world—this was one of the fundamental reasons.

However, once a true name was grasped by a cultivator, the spirit or monster would be at their mercy.

Thus, Chen Ping'an had never inquired about the true names of the little boy in blue and the girl in pink.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an chuckled, full of confidence. “If you can’t think of your own, it’s okay. I can help you come up with names. It’s my specialty!”

The boy in blue, who had been absent-mindedly eating seeds, looked as if struck by lightning. He dropped the seeds on the table, bracing himself on the stone table, and wailed, “No! I can think of a name myself slowly. My lord, you’ve worked so hard already; don’t burden yourself further…”

Even the girl in pink, who was usually quite affectionate, began to stiffen her cute little face.

Chen Ping'an glanced at the boy in blue and then at the girl in pink. “Truly don’t need my help? Once this opportunity passes, it won’t come again. Don’t regret it later.”

The boy in blue quickly rubbed his cheeks and muttered, “Damn it, surviving calamity.”

The girl in pink, fearing her lord's disappointment, pretended not to be as happy, holding her rosy little face tight.

Not giving up, Chen Ping'an tentatively asked, “While traveling back home, I thought of quite a few names. Why don’t I share some with you?”

The boy in blue looked ready to cry. “My lord, I’ve heard that a scholar’s knowledge diminishes with use. With four swords, on the first and fifteenth, we subdue demons and slay monsters. Your knowledge and talent should be nearly exhausted. Save some for later!”

The boy's head thudded onto the stone table as he feigned death, but feeling bored, he occasionally reached for a sunflower seed, slightly tilting his head to sneak a nibble.

Chen Ping'an sighed. “Alright then, if you regret it later, just let me know.”

With his face pressed against the table, the boy in blue made a face at the girl in pink.

She stifled a laugh.

Chen Ping'an smiled gently, ruffling her little head.

While riding back home, Chen Ping'an perused bamboo slips, carefully reviewing the beautiful words written on them to find good names for the two little ones.

Such a pity; there was no opportunity for a hero to demonstrate their worth.

After discussing serious matters, the two little ones stood up to bid farewell, running off swiftly.

Chen Ping'an chuckled to himself, sitting still. The table still had some sunflower seeds left uneaten by the boy in blue, which he picked up one by one, munching on them alone.

Regarding the matter of signing a mountain contract with the Da Li Song family, a deputy minister from the Ministry of Rites would be dispatched by the court.

Chen Ping'an clapped his hands, pulled out the talisman of the Night Wanderer, hesitating slightly.

Wei Ban had mentioned that although the Li family on Fulu Street had deep roots, their ancestor had forcibly broken through the Golden Core bottleneck, stepping into the Nascent Soul realm at great expense. This relatively “young” Nascent Soul cultivator, accustomed to the small world after the barriers of the Ru Zhu Cave Heaven were broken, found that the benefits he previously enjoyed had reverted to the vast world, which had become a calamity. He had a weak foundation and a high realm, leading to the precarious situation of seawater flooding in, requiring the expenditure of immortal money to construct dams to prevent the continuous invasion of malevolent energies.

Moreover, the Li family had taken over a dilapidated mansion belonging to the descendants of fallen nobles in Da Li's capital, which incurred immense expenses. Thus, the Li family was genuinely in need of money now.

The four prominent families along Fulu Street and Taoye Alley had changed significantly.

Some had relocated, vanishing without a trace, while others had fallen silent, leaving unclear whether they were conserving strength or conspiring behind the scenes to injure their vitality. Meanwhile, families that had not been on the list back then, such as the Xie family from Taoye Alley, had risen to prominence due to the emergence of Xie Shi, the ancestor of the Heavenly Monarch of Beiju Luzhou, now standing as a leading family in Taoye Alley.

On the second floor, the elder said, “Start practicing your punches tomorrow.”

Chen Ping'an responded affirmatively, rising to head to the small pond behind the bamboo tower. The water in the pond was crystal clear, a simple feat after Wei Ban excavated it, as the source of fresh water came directly from Piyun Mountain, into which he had tossed a golden lotus seed.

Crouching beside the pond, Chen Ping'an gently patted the ground, smiling, “Come out.”

A little lotus person burst forth from the soil, completely clean of dirt, giggling as they tugged at Chen Ping'an's green robe, swiftly hopping onto his shoulder.

Chen Ping'an had already told Wei Ban to help keep an eye on the little lotus being. At that time, Wei Ban had seemed dazed but simply nodded.

After watching the little pond for a while, he naturally couldn’t see any flowers blooming.

Chen Ping'an stood up, carrying the little lotus being as he walked toward the first floor, which served as his formal residence.

Many items were left there. When Chen Ping'an wasn't at Luopo Mountain, the girl in pink would clean the place every day, ensuring it was spotless and not allowing the boy in blue to enter at will.

Sitting at the table, Chen Ping'an suddenly smiled. Since he was still in his green robe, why not act as a steward again? Time to take stock of his current possessions.

The little lotus being jumped onto the table, starting to scurry around, checking whether the items and books on the table were arranged neatly. It scrutinized everything meticulously, and if anything was out of place, it would gently adjust it. The little one was extremely busy.

Chen Ping'an's gaze suddenly fell upon a seal box on the table. When he opened it, he found a personal seal inside. After several travels, he hadn’t carried it with him. By chance, it could be considered Luopo Mountain’s current treasure.

He raised the seal high, which was engraved with three characters.

Chen Shiyi.

Chen Ping'an stared at those three ancient seal characters for a long time.

He placed the seal horizontally on the table, resting his chin on his crossed arms, gazing at the inscription on the bottom.

Sitting up, he twisted his wrist, summoning the water character seal of his life item from his Water Mansion, and gently placed it beside the other.

Now, the two seals were no longer solitary.

Chen Ping'an lay back on the table, speaking to himself, “I hope that one day, when someone tries to reason with me without logic, they will first ask about my fists and swords, whether I agree or not. But right now, my boxing skills are still low, and my swordsmanship is lacking. What should I do now that the ten-year agreement has passed its halfway point?”

At that moment, behind him, the sheathed sword immortal let out a sound like a dragon’s roar, echoing against the wall.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 530: There is No Distinction in Striking

On the first floor of the bamboo building, a row of antique shelves had been neatly arranged. The wood was a simple, elegant color, with many compartments but few treasures.

Chen Ping'an wanted to take some items from the small collection to enhance the appearance of his place. However, he paused, realizing that despite years of travel and having encountered many fine things, he seemed to have very little left. Aside from the items gifted by Lu Tai from the Fortune-Telling Sect and the presents from Wu Yi at the Ziyang Manor, plus the lady's painting he bought on Yelling Street in Chishui City and a few small trinkets given by the old shopkeeper, it appeared his possessions were fewer than he had imagined. One by one, these treasures drifted away like leaves on water, easily lost or given away.

He couldn’t help but think of the checkpoint on the border between Shihai Kingdom and Meiyou Kingdom, aptly named "Leave Behind." Though it suggested a place to stay, it was clear that nothing could truly be held there.

Some items were borrowed from others, like the ancestral armor "West Peak" that Wei Xian wore, the narrow dagger "Stop Snow" at Lu Baixiang's waist, the "Love-Struck Sword" on Sui's back, and the jade token "I Cultivate the Auspicious Qi" in Wei Ban's hand. Many more treasures had already been given away, like the City God’s seal he received from the Yanzhi County in the Colorful Clothes Kingdom, and many people from Falling Fortune Mountain had been gifted by Chen Ping'an. Not to mention that even in a dog meat shop in Shihai Kingdom, he had given away a small amount of summer coins, and in the spring flower forest of Meiyou Kingdom, he had spent money and gifted medicine. Even earlier, on Osmanthus Island, he had scattered snake gall stones into the water to feed a young dragon.

Chen Ping'an self-deprecatingly thought, "The moment of generosity was grand, but later I feel the heartache."

After thinking for a moment, he rubbed his chin, nodding to himself, "Good poetry!"

The little lotus person, who had been resting on the table, immediately fell backward, lying on the ground with only one little arm left, vigorously patting its belly and laughing incessantly.

Seeing the lively and adorable little creature brought a smile to Chen Ping'an's face. In Falling Fortune Mountain, as long as it wasn’t flattery, he found every word pleasant to hear.

He extended a finger, gently tickling the little one’s armpit. The little creature rolled around on the ground, ultimately unable to escape Chen Ping'an's antics. It had no choice but to sit up straight, puffing its cheeks, and with its remaining arm, it pointed to a stack of books on the desk, seemingly trying to tell the young scholar that the desk was not a place for play.

Chen Ping'an chuckled and stopped his playful actions.

He took out some belongings from the small collection, placing them neatly on the table.

While his possessions were fewer than expected, Chen Ping'an still had a decent amount. Not only had he received income from his mountain, but he was also carrying a sword fairy on his back, which was no small matter—it was a genuine semi-immortal weapon, not just a mere trinket from the Fu family in Old Dragon City.

The golden nectar robe taken from the old dragon in the Jiao Long Valley was indeed a relic of an overseas immortal. That nameless immortal, unable to ascend, had to undergo a reincarnation, and the golden nectar had not vanished into thin air. It served as a testament to its existence. Thus, when Chen Ping'an learned that the golden nectar could grow into a semi-immortal weapon by consuming golden coins, he was not overly surprised.

There was also an incomplete walnut bracelet; each carved walnut could deliver a lethal blow comparable to that of an ordinary Golden Core Earth Immortal.

He had a light blue robe, which, while not reaching the status of a magical artifact, was one he particularly liked, as he felt the white robe of golden nectar was too eye-catching.

He planned to carry the walnut bracelet and blue robe with him when heading to North Ji Lu Prefecture.

The table was cluttered with items.

Two seals were placed right in the center, surrounded by everything else.

Chen Ping'an quietly began to tally accounts. Not repaying debts was certainly not an option.

Zhu Lian had once shared his experience, saying that borrowing money was a litmus test for friendship. Often, many so-called friends would become estranged after lending money. But there would always be one or two who would repay. Zhu Lian also mentioned that there were two types of repayments: one where the person pays back as soon as they have the money, and another that is more valuable—those who temporarily cannot repay but will keep in touch, not avoiding the topic, and will repay once they are financially stable. If you press them for repayment, they would feel guilty and apologize, never harboring resentment.

Zhu Lian said that the latter type of friend could sustain a long-term relationship, and one would not feel bothered even after a lifetime, because of shared memories and gratitude.

At that time, Chen Ping'an had jokingly asked Zhu Lian if he planned to borrow money from him and if he would take a long time to repay it.

Zhu Lian had bowed slightly, rubbing his hands together, saying, "Young master, you truly are a learned scholar, able to predict the future."

The hunchbacked old man indeed had the audacity to borrow some summer coins from Chen Ping'an, claiming he wanted to build a private library behind his residence.

Of course, Chen Ping'an lent him the money. A wandering martial artist, to some extent, was connected to the fate of his nation. For him to borrow ten summer coins, Zhu Lian wouldn’t need to dilly-dally for half a day, and Chen Ping'an felt quite indignant on Zhu Lian's behalf. However, he insisted that ten summer coins were ten coins—no more.

Chen Ping'an required that once Zhu Lian built the library, it must be a forbidden area of Falling Fortune Mountain, not to be entered by anyone without permission.

Zhu Lian agreed. Chen Ping'an estimated that the bookshop business in Longquan County would soon flourish again.

The little lotus person was still busy arranging the items, meticulously placing them in order. Chen Ping'an had no idea where this habit of the little creature came from.

He allowed it to busy itself while he continued calculating his accounts.

The secret warehouse on Qingxia Island and Liu Chongrun on Pearl Hairpin Island were both in debt.

However, the real big expenditures would certainly come from organizing the grand Daoist and water-land ceremonies in cooperation with Gu Can. If they were to go all out, it could become two bottomless pits, definitely not something that a few spring rain coins could cover.

Typically, when a small nation’s ruler or a wealthy individual held a grand ceremony or a Daoist event, the invited Taoist priests and monks were often not practitioners themselves. Even if there were, they were few and far between, which kept the costs manageable. 

Spending tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of taels could easily fund a couple of such events. Even if it required spending five hundred thousand taels of silver—and converting that into summer coins equates to five small summer coins or half a spring rain coin—this would be a major event in any of the vassal states of Baopingzhou.

However, once it involved practitioners, especially if they hired Earth Immortals to preside, and dealt with renowned temples and old deities, even if they were benevolent, with a compassionate heart saying “just do as you see fit,” how could Chen Ping'an and Gu Can truly take it lightly when it came to parting with their silver? Moreover, before leaving Shujian Lake, Chen Ping'an had discussed with Gu Can that the two ceremonies should be grand rather than small and must ensure that there were no opportunists looking to gain fame and fortune, or else it would not just be wasting the money of the immortals but would also hinder the karmic blessings and reincarnations of those spirits and ghosts.

Thus, within two years, Gu Can would have to consecutively hold two ceremonies, which would be an extremely exhausting, eye-testing, and patience-requiring endeavor.

This was also a form of training for Gu Can. Since he chose to amend his mistakes, it meant embarking on an arduous and difficult path.

Years ago, in the mountains south of Shujian Lake, demons roamed, and evil cultivators lurked amidst the miasma. Yet, what was even more challenging was the burden Gu Can carried—the two underworld Yama Halls and the many send-offs. Twice along the way, Gu Can nearly gave up.

Amending one’s mistakes was not simply saying, “I know I was wrong,” and then breezing through it, taking a long detour, and throwing some money around, feeling justified as if one had done something remarkable or virtuous.

Such good things simply did not exist!

However, Chen Ping'an was well aware that Gu Can had not moved from one extreme to another. His disposition was still wavering, but after experiencing great hardship at Shujian Lake, he nearly choked on it. Thus, Gu Can's current state of mind was somewhat akin to how Chen Ping'an felt when he first traversed the Jianghu, mimicking those closest to him, observing their ways, and after contemplation, adapting them for his own use. His character had changed, but not drastically.

Gu Can was still fundamentally Gu Can.

He just understood better the weight of rules.

Chen Ping'an stood up, hanging the sword fairy on the wall.

He stepped outside under the eaves, where he and the little lotus person sat on a small bamboo chair. The ordinary material had yellowed over the years.

Chen Ping'an sat there, starting to doze off. The bamboo building was warm in spring and cool in summer, throughout the four seasons. Even a frail, mortal scholar could sit here for an extended period without worrying about catching cold or overheating. It was even more celestial than Cui Dongshan’s courtyard at the Cliffside Academy.

Tomorrow, he would be practicing his punches again.

In his drowsy state, he seemed to see a flower blooming in a distant, filthy place filled with human hearts and ghostly tricks, swaying elegantly.

Chen Ping'an did not wake up but fell into a deep slumber.

The little lotus person sitting at the edge of the neighboring chair raised its head, gently swinging its legs, seeing Chen Ping'an with a smile on his face, as if he were dreaming of something beautiful.

The sun rose, and soon the sky was painted with brilliant colors.

The bamboo building shook as Chen Ping'an, who had slept through the night in the chair, suddenly woke up.

He kicked off his boots, rolled up his sleeves and pant legs, and climbed to the second floor.

Upon reaching the outside of the second floor, Chen Ping'an paused, lowering his gaze and turning to look.

Cui Dongshan must have sat here at that time, not entering the house, finally reuniting with his grandfather after a hundred years, maintaining his youthful appearance and temperament.

The two sat across from each other, but no one knew what they spoke of.

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to step inside, he suddenly said, “I’ll go greet Shi Rou, be right back.”

The barefoot old man ignored him, sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed in deep concentration.

Chen Ping'an jumped down the stairs without putting on his boots, quickly heading towards the adjacent residences. Zhu Lian and Pei Qian had not yet returned; only the reclusive Shi Rou remained, along with a newly arrived Cen Yanji.

Not seeing Shi Rou, he first spotted Cen Yanji. The tall girl seemed to have just returned from a walk to enjoy the scenery. Upon seeing Chen Ping'an, she hesitated, wanting to speak but holding back. Chen Ping'an nodded in acknowledgment and knocked on the door of Shi Rou's residence. After Shi Rou opened the door, she asked, “Is there something you need, Young Master?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, saying, “Once Pei Qian returns, tell her to keep an eye on the shop in Qilong Alley. You accompany her. Also, remind her not to take Qu Huang to the small town. With her memory, she might forget everything if she plays too much. Keep an eye on her copying books. If Pei Qian wants to attend school, it should be the one run by the Chen family at Longwei Creek. If she agrees, have Zhu Lian check with the county office to see if there are any requirements. If there’s nothing needed, that would be even better.”

Shi Rou agreed but hesitated for a moment, asking, “Young Master, can I stay on the mountain?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “If you really don’t want to interact with outsiders, you can. But I suggest you adapt more to this little world in Longquan County. It would be good to visit the Wenwu Temple and further out, the Iron Talisman River Water God Temple, to become familiar with the surroundings. Your roots will eventually be exposed. Even if Wei Ban doesn’t speak, there are plenty of talented individuals in the Great Li Kingdom. It will be seen through sooner or later, so it’s better to appear first. Of course, this is just my personal opinion; I won’t force you on what to do.”

Shi Rou’s face brightened, nodding, “Then I’ll give it a try.”

Chen Ping'an helplessly said, “In the future, don’t refer to yourself as a servant in front of outsiders. It will make people look at you and then look at me oddly. By then, perhaps the first famous thing about Falling Fortune Mountain will be that I have strange habits. Longquan County isn’t very large; once this spreads, our reputations will be ruined. I can’t explain it to each and every mountain.”

Shi Rou stifled a laugh, “Young Master, your thoughts are meticulous; I’ve learned.”

Chen Ping'an was even more helpless, quickly waving his hand, “Falling Fortune Mountain doesn’t lack your flattery.”

Shi Rou naturally covered her mouth and laughed.

Chen Ping'an sighed inwardly and returned to the bamboo building.

Because not far from the house, a girl who seemed to be casually walking but was secretly observing had already gotten goosebumps. Cen Yanji tiptoed away, feeling as though she had glimpsed some incredible truth. After closing the door, she gently patted her chest, muttering to herself, “Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid, this is probably a good thing, so he won’t harbor any ill intentions towards you.”

The girl felt a mix of bitterness. Having thought that moving away would free her from dealing with those dreadful nobles, she unexpectedly found herself in the very fairy mansion she had once yearned for, only to encounter such a seemingly unlearned mountain lord. After arriving at Falling Fortune Mountain, regarding the young lord, the old god Zhu did not speak much, allowing her to guess around. All she heard were ambiguous praises. She didn’t dare take them seriously. As for that girl named Pei Qian, she was like a ghost, appearing and disappearing like the wind, making it difficult for Cen Yanji to say anything to her.

**On the Second Floor.**

When Chen Ping'an stood still, the barefoot old man opened his eyes and stood up, speaking in a deep voice, “Before we begin practicing punches, let me introduce myself. I am Cui Cheng, former head of the Cui family.”

Chen Ping'an was somewhat surprised.

This was the first time the old man had introduced himself.

Cui Cheng continued slowly, “The gentleman Cui Minghuang, the young man who previously represented the Guanh Lake Academy to collect debts from the Lihuzhou Cave Heaven, according to the family tree, he should call Cui Zhan 'granduncle.' That lineage was once a side branch of the Cui family, but now it has become the main line. My branch has been disowned due to my reckless actions. All members of this branch have been removed from the family tree, living and dying separately. The pain of being in a noble family is immense. The reason for my downfall is that I once lost my senses and wandered the streets for over a century. If this debt were to be tallied, it would be quite simple to settle it with a martial artist’s methods—just a punch or two at the Cui family temple. However, if I, Cui Cheng, and my grandson Cui Zhan or Cui Dongshan, still consider ourselves scholars, it becomes difficult because there’s no fault to be found in the family rules.”

Chen Ping'an nodded in understanding.

In the long river of time in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, there had been powerful officials in the history of Songlai Kingdom who, being born of a concubine, had disputes with local families over their mother’s memorial tablet and family tree. They sought to discuss it with their elder brother, who had no official title. After writing many letters home, their elder brother initially ignored them. Eventually, perhaps tired of this younger brother’s persistence, he replied with a letter that flatly rejected the suggestion. In that letter was a rather impolite phrase, “You can meddle in worldly affairs as you please, but family matters are beyond your qualification.” That high-ranking official never got what he wished for before his death, and at that time, the entire officialdom and scholarly community recognized this as “a small rule.”

So why didn’t Cui Cheng emerge from the family to settle things with the temple’s ants? Why didn’t that high-ranking official use public power for private means, forcing a document to be enacted?

Clearly, he could have done so but chose not to break this seemingly fragile rule.

Chen Ping'an pondered for a moment.

This was probably why Cui Cheng was able to attain the state of being untroubled today, while that high-ranking official could reside in lofty temples; they were fundamentally different.

If Chen Ping'an truly decided to establish a sect on Falling Fortune Mountain, it could be complicated beyond measure or relatively simple. It was merely a matter of practicality, like a swallow carrying mud, accumulating little by little, while the essence lay in people, adhering to principles, moving slowly but surely, and steadily moving upward.

All of this required Chen Ping'an to think more, learn more, and do more.

Cui Cheng suddenly said, “That Cui Minghuang kid is not simple; don’t underestimate him.”

Chen Ping'an was somewhat at a loss for words.

What qualifications did he have to “underestimate” a scholar from the academy?

He had already experienced the brilliance of the wise Zhou Ju from the Guanh Lake Academy at the Shunshui Mountain Villa.

And Zhong Kui from Tongyezhou had also been a gentleman from the academy.

Cui Minghuang was renowned as the “Little Lord of Guanh Lake.”

He was one of the most outstanding gentlemen in the Baopingzhou Academy.

According to the agreement with the Grand Master of the Great Li Nation, who was also his granduncle, Cui Minghuang would leave the Guanh Lake Academy openly, taking up the position of the vice master of the Great Li Lindu Academy as a gentleman from the academy. The first master of the Piyun Mountain Academy was supposed to be that old dragon, who was a former minister of Huangting Kingdom, along with a local scholar from Great Li as the two vice masters. All three masters were transitional, and once the Lindu Academy received the title of one of the seventy-two academies, Cheng ShuIDong would step down from the master position, and the local scholar from Great Li would have neither the strength nor the desire to compete. 

Cui Minghuang would then smoothly take the position of the next master.

This arrangement would benefit the Guanh Lake Academy, while the profits would still largely fall into Cui Zhan's hands. Cui Minghuang, who had long conspired with him, would obtain the coveted position of academy master, which was a tremendous honor—the pinnacle for a scholar. Moreover, as long as Cui Minghuang remained in Longquan of Great Li, with Cui Zhan’s calculating ability, no matter how lofty Cui Minghuang’s ambitions were, he would mostly be a teacher under Cui Zhan’s watchful eye.

However, later on, the situation became unpredictable, and many outcomes were beyond even the Grand Master Cui Zhan's expectations.

For example, the imitation of the White Jade Capital in Great Li nearly became a fleeting joke, and the late emperor, Song Zhengchun, was severely injured. The Great Li Iron Cavalry advanced southward, and Cui Zhan's many plans in central Baopingzhou began to unfold, with the Guanh Lake Academy responding vigorously, dispatching numerous gentlemen and wise men to either personally visit the palaces of various countries to admonish their rulers or to resolve the chaos in various regions.

In particular, the crash of the cross-province ferry at Jiaojiao Mountain in the Zhu Ying Dynasty and the sudden emergence of the heavenly lord Xie Shi from North Ji Lu Prefecture, putting pressure on the Guanh Lake Academy behind Zhu Ying, not only drew the ire of the cultivators of the entire region but also led to a complete rupture between the Guanh Lake Academy and the Great Li Song family. Cui Minghuang could only remain within the academy and could not assume the vice master position of the Lindu Academy. It was said that this gentleman had spent these years diligently studying in his study, without wasting a single moment, earning high praise from the academy.

Chen Ping'an found it strange.

This time, the old man seemed unusually unhurried in “teaching him how to be a person.”

In the past, he would come straight to the point, making every punch land hard, as if it were the greatest joy for him to watch Chen Ping'an suffer. Today, however, he opened with casual conversation and chatted quite a bit.

Cui Cheng was not the type to be awkward. Although it didn’t quite match his temperament, he still took the initiative for the second time to mention Pei Qian’s martial arts training, asking, “Are you really looking to give Pei Qian a carefree life?”

It truly was a shame to waste Pei Qian's exceptional talent.

Chen Ping'an hesitated for a moment, “A certain careless remark from a senior might be forgotten as soon as it’s spoken, but a child might hold it in their heart forever, especially if it’s a heartfelt word from a predecessor.”

Cui Cheng frowned.

There was a hidden meaning in his words.

It was naturally a complaint about his earlier, intentional jab at Pei Qian. That was nothing. However, Chen Ping'an's attitude was what deserved deeper consideration.

It seemed Chen Ping'an was deliberately avoiding the topic of Pei Qian's martial arts training. On the surface, it was to go with the flow, but on a deeper level, it seemed he feared that she might surpass him, his somewhat inadequate master. Of course, Cui Cheng, being familiar with Chen Ping'an’s nature, understood that he was not worried about Pei Qian outpacing him in martial arts but was more concerned about something else, such as the worry that good things might turn into bad ones.

Cui Cheng said displeased, “Speak your mind.”

Chen Ping'an hesitated once more.

Cui Cheng chuckled, “If you won’t speak now, I have my ways to make you open your mouth.”

Chen Ping'an, however, stood firm, “How will you do that? If you disregard the difference in realms, I can speak now. But if you’re willing to spar at the same level, I’ll say it after I lose.”

Cui Cheng replied, “Then you can speak now. The moment I see that look on your face, I can’t help but want to throw a punch.”

Chen Ping'an cursed inwardly.

On this trip back home, facing Zhu Lian’s “feeding punches” incident, the only confidence he held deep within was that he could spar at the same level, hoping to vent his frustrations and at least land a few punches on the old man. As for whether he would be beaten worse afterwards, he didn’t care. There was no way he could practice punches from the third realm to the fifth realm and not even touch the old man's corner of clothing.

With a sigh, Chen Ping'an finally shared that strange dream with the old man.

This was the first time he had confided in someone about it.

The old man remained silent.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Can you help interpret this dream? Or according to the old tales from my hometown, dreams come in reverse?”

The old man scoffed, “Oh, here we go again, a major knot in your heart. One is the fear of death, and the other is the fear of not measuring up. What’s going on, Chen Ping'an? You’ve traveled far, and your courage is diminishing?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “It’s precisely because I’ve seen more of the world that I understand that out there, exceptional individuals abound. There’s always someone better. It’s not that I look down on myself, but I can’t be overly arrogant, thinking that just because I’ve practiced hard, I can win against anyone. Human strength has its limits...”

The old man looked disdainful, sneering, “Foolish!”

Chen Ping'an sincerely sought advice, “Please, senior, enlighten me.”

The old man suddenly stood, and Chen Ping'an sensed it, but his limbs were slower than his mind, just like when he used to make porcelain, with his palms not aligning, leading to frequent errors.

It wasn’t that Chen Ping'an was too “slow” to get up; it was genuinely that a pinnacle martial artist of the tenth realm was too fast.

Chen Ping'an had no choice but to raise both arms to block in front of himself, only to take a knee to the forehead from Cui Cheng, sending him flying high against the wall, crashing down. Then, he received a kick to the abdomen, propelling him up to the ceiling before he landed heavily on the ground, and finally, a kick to the forehead sent him sliding away, spitting blood with no power to retaliate.

Truly vengeful.

Using a knee strike to ambush was Chen Ping'an’s previous tactic.

Cui Cheng crossed his arms, standing in the center of the room, smiling, “If you don’t put in some effort, I fear you won’t appreciate the value of my golden words.”

Chen Ping'an stood up, spitting blood.

Cui Cheng asked, “If fate is predetermined, can Pei Qian slack off in her martial arts training and escape? Only a martial artist of the highest caliber can wrestle with the heavens! After you wandered for so long in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, what have you learned about the world? Don’t you get it?!”

Chen Ping'an didn’t need to use his eyes to catch the old man’s figure; in that instant, his heart and mind sank, entering a state of “no one in front of me, only myself,” a profound state of being. He stomped heavily on the ground, throwing a punch into emptiness.

However, this punch was easily deflected by Cui Cheng, as if he had been struck by a heavy hammer in the chest. Chen Ping'an's back pressed against the wall, his elbow bracing it, along with the sudden force of his relaxed punch, shooting forward faster than his retreating body, lunging at the old man. Unexpectedly, he crashed right into the old man's arm, which struck his neck, sending Chen Ping'an crashing to the floor, the force so great that he bounced multiple times before being kicked in the forehead by the old man.

Cui Cheng looked down at Chen Ping'an, who was bleeding from all seven orifices. “Not bad, but your strength is too small, your punches too slow, and your ambition too shallow. Every move is flawed; you dare to clash with me head-on? A little girl playing with a longsword, are you not afraid of breaking your waist?”

Chen Ping'an clapped his hands on the ground, flipping over with his feet in the air, his head sliding out from under the old man's soles, and with his hands bracing on the ground, he spun rapidly, barely dodging the old man's casual whip kick.

Unexpectedly, the old man slightly raised his sleeve, and a punch force “brushed” against Chen Ping'an, who was welcoming the attack with the earth stance, sending him crashing into the bamboo building’s northern windows.

The old man did not pursue but casually asked, “Have you spoken with Wei Ban about the new site selection for the Five Mountains of Great Li?”

Chen Ping'an struggled to rise, shaking his head, “I thought about it but decided against it. The top secrets of Great Li are not something I dare to disclose lightly. Friends are friends, but I can’t sell out my own student for favors. Moreover, Wei Ban is currently in a precarious position, and it’s best to be cautious.”

Cui Cheng nodded, still standing in place, “As for personal matters, some can be done while others should not be mentioned. When it comes to speaking of good and bad, it’s best to remain silent.”

Chen Ping'an silently memorized these two old sayings from the elder; having an elder at home is as valuable as a treasure, worth more than gold.

Cui Cheng shouted, “Dare to be distracted while fighting?!”

Though it seemed Chen Ping'an was distracted, in reality, he was employing the Sword Qi Eighteen Stops secret technique, applying it to the pure transformation of his true energy, forcibly extracting half a mouthful of true energy. After enduring a punch from the old man, he gritted his teeth and, ignoring the soul-wrenching pain, threw a punch, turning it into two fingers, just an inch away from striking the old man’s brow.

The old man reached out and grabbed Chen Ping'an's two fingers, yanking and kicking him, sending Chen Ping'an soaring several steps backward. Then, he shifted direction, leaning into Chen Ping'an, colliding with a loud bang. Chen Ping'an once again found himself at odds with the bamboo building’s wall, ultimately collapsing against it, unable to stand. That half mouthful of true energy was a desperate measure, intended to harm the enemy while injuring oneself; when facing the old man, it meant only self-harm.

The old man rubbed his chin, smiling, “I must say, as of now, you aren’t entirely useless. Back when you were hardening your foundation at the third realm, your punches could only be described as foolish, but today, with this newfound intelligence, it seems the more punches you take, the sharper your mind becomes.”

Chen Ping'an remained expressionless, wiping his face, blood covering his hands. Compared to the agony he had suffered in the past, this level of injury was merely an itch; it was truly a small matter.

Leaning against the wall, Chen Ping'an slowly stood up, “Let’s do it again.”

The old man smiled, asking, “Let me ask you one last question. Are you so afraid of death because you have money now and cherish your life, or do you think you cannot die?”

Taking the opportunity, Chen Ping'an countered with a question, “Is there a difference?”

The old man’s punch was already approaching, “No difference; both mean getting hit.”

After Pei Qian and Zhu Lian delivered the letter to Niujiao Mountain, she had just become good friends with the horse Qu Huang. They had agreed that they would become friends and that in the future, whether she could wander the Jianghu by day and return home for dinner at night would depend on Qu Huang’s stamina. The better Qu Huang’s stamina, the bigger her Jianghu would become; perhaps she could even go back and forth between Falling Fortune Mountain and the small town. As for this so-called agreement, it was merely Pei Qian leading the horse and chattering away by herself, each time asking, “If you don’t respond, I’ll take it as you agree,” and at most giving a thumbs-up to praise, “No wonder you’re my friend, always willing to help, never refusing; keep up the good habits.”

This made Zhu Lian wear an expression as if he had pulled a fly out of his bowl.

Once back at Falling Fortune Mountain, Shi Rou relayed Chen Ping'an’s instructions.

Pei Qian could only bid a reluctant farewell to Qu Huang, following Shi Rou down the mountain toward the small town.

At the years-old New Year’s shop in Qilong Alley, aside from the pastry chef who had remained unchanged, the rest of the staff had been completely replaced. A girl had gotten married, and another had found a better job, working as a maid in a big family at Taoye Alley, enjoying a leisurely life. She often returned to the shop, frequently talking about how good that family was, saying that they treated their servants like their own children. Working there truly felt like a blessing.

There was also a woman whose family had unearthed two long-neglected heirlooms, becoming rich overnight and moving to a new county town. She had visited the shop twice, actually to boast to that “unqualified” Miss Ruan, having spent enough time with her that all the talk about Master Ruan’s only daughter and the distant Dragon Spring Sword Sect didn’t impress her. She merely found that the girl treated everyone coldly, unappealingly, especially after a small incident where she caught Miss Ruan in a compromising situation, which made her feel quite awkward, leading her to grumble internally about how a young lady like her, with no identity tied to Chen Zhanggui, spent all day at the shop pretending to be the hostess.

Compared to the fragrant New Year’s shop, Pei Qian preferred the nearby herbal shop. Rows of tall, treasure-laden cabinets were filled with antiques that the Sun family had once sold off in bulk.

Back when Miss Ruan was in charge, she had sold some items that were referred to as spirit artifacts by the mountain’s practitioners for high prices, but afterwards, sales had declined considerably. Mainly, a few items had been secretly preserved by Miss Ruan, who had once taken Pei Qian to the back storage room to “appraise” them, explaining that these were all top-notch goods, the treasures of the shop, and could only be brought out for big customers or fools; otherwise, it was better not to waste money.

Pei Qian had been thrilled at that time, laughing so hard that she couldn’t close her mouth. When Miss Ruan saw her expression, she probably found it amusing and gave her a piece of pastry. That was the first time Miss Ruan had shared pastry with her. After that, whenever Pei Qian wanted some, Miss Ruan wouldn’t refuse.

Today, Pei Qian set a small stool behind the counter, standing there just right to make her head “rise above water,” as if her head were placed on the counter.

As for Pei Qian, she felt more like a mountain bandit, surveying her small territory.

Shi Rou stood beside Pei Qian; the counter was indeed a bit high, and she was only slightly better off than Pei Qian standing on the stool.

Shi Rou found it strange that Pei Qian, who clearly relied on her master, still obediently came down the mountain to stay quietly here.

Unable to resist, Shi Rou asked, “Pei Qian, aren’t you worried that your master might make a mistake while practicing punches?”

Pei Qian remained unmoving, staring intently ahead, as if playing a game of “who’s a wooden person.” She merely moved her lips slightly, “I’m worried, but I can’t do anything, so I can only pretend not to be worried, to keep my master from worrying that I’m worried.”

Shi Rou rubbed her forehead with her finger, following Zheng Dafeng’s saying, feeling a headache coming on.

Pei Qian sighed, still staring straight ahead, “Sister Shi Rou, what do you think about someone living in someone else's home, and that person is not your friend? Do you need to pay?”

What she said was convoluted and sounded even more perplexing.

Shi Rou puzzled, “What are you talking about?”

Pei Qian sighed, “Sister Shi Rou, let’s copy books together in the future; we’ll have company.”

Shi Rou was amused and exasperated, “Why would I copy books?”

Pei Qian, with a serious expression, replied, “Copying books makes one smart.”

Shi Rou finally understood that Pei Qian’s comment about “living in someone else’s home” was a veiled jab at herself for residing in the inherited relic gifted by her master.

Shi Rou extended her finger, wanting to lightly flick the little girl on the forehead, just like Chen Ping'an would.

However, Pei Qian, who was pretending to be a wooden person and looking straight ahead, dodged lightning-fast, then resumed her original stance, never glancing at Shi Rou, and Pei Qian complained, “Don’t mess around; I’m trying to think about my master!”
