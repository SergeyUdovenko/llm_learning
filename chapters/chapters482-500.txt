 ### Chapter 482: The Waves of Hengbo

Chen Ping'an and Tan Yuanyi arrived at Hengbo Manor almost simultaneously, but one was bright while the other was shrouded in darkness.

Liu Zhimiao personally led the accountant, holding a charcoal stove, into a secret chamber. To Chen Ping'an’s surprise, the walls and floor were covered in snowflake coins, with only four meditation cushions placed around. Tan Yuanyi, the island master of Grain Island, was already seated on one of the cushions, eyes closed in rest. When Liu Zhimiao and Chen Ping'an entered side by side, he opened his eyes, stood up, and smiled, “Mr. Chen, your reputation precedes you.”

Chen Ping'an asked a rather aimless question, “Regarding the situation at Shujian Lake, can you tell me about your colleague from the Green Wave Pavilion, Li Baozhen, who is currently in the Qingluan Kingdom?”

Tan Yuanyi replied, “Every so often, there are exchanges of critical intelligence. If you prefer that your name isn't mentioned too much in these reports, I can personally help you with that.”

Chen Ping'an naturally expressed his gratitude with a bow. Tan Yuanyi then offered some polite words, noting that Mr. Chen was a mountain lord in Longquan County and a dear friend of the North Mountain's deity, Wei Bo. Within the Green Wave Pavilion, everyone had long admired Chen Ping'an's name.

In reality, Chen Ping'an felt neither surprise nor gratitude; instead, a sense of worry began to take root in his heart regarding tonight’s secret meeting. The officials of the Great Li Dynasty, especially those spies placed outside the dynasty, were strictly bound by rules and laws. Tan Yuanyi’s so-called “help” was an exception. If it were any other practitioners from Shujian Lake, this could be understood as a gesture of goodwill for business dealings. However, Chen Ping'an was extremely familiar with some operational rules of the Great Li, and he had a history with a former enemy who happened to be the original owner of the Green Wave Pavilion—a certain lady in the palace, the most powerful woman in the Great Li Dynasty. Tan Yuanyi’s willingness to bend the rules, even slightly, indicated that he needed to make up for it quietly with Chen Ping'an, which was simply business as usual. Many friendships faltered over money, turning once-friendly faces into enemies—not merely due to the supposed unkindness of those so-called friends but also because of one’s inability to see clearly. Furthermore, the sequence of events and the balance of right and wrong often became muddled due to emotional entanglements, leading to mutual ruin.

The three took their seats together.

One was the head of a Great Li spy, an expert in crossing rivers.  
One was a Yuanying (Nascent Soul) practitioner from Shujian Lake, a local powerhouse.  
One was an accountant with roots in Longquan County and serving in Qingxia Island, a passing traveler.

Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged, his hands resting on the charcoal stove, and asked directly, “Due to the recent upheaval in Old Dragon City, the Great Li Song Clan owes me a significant sum of gold and copper. Does the island master know anything about this?”

Tan Yuanyi nodded, “This is a top secret of the Green Wave Pavilion. Only I have access to some general information regarding the spies hidden in the central part of Baoping Continent. The specific details remain beyond my authority to know, as they are intentionally vague in the Great Li documents.”

Chen Ping'an inquired further, “As for the Great Li military, are the two cavalry units that arrived at the borders of the Zhu Ying Dynasty dissatisfied with you, Master Tan?”

Tan Yuanyi's expression shifted slightly.

The Great Li was known for its martial spirit, from the official court to the rivers and lakes, and even among the common people. Their fierce national character was not an exaggeration; thus, they had long been mocked by Baoping Continent as “northern barbarians.” 

Most of the influential families in the Great Li had deep roots in the military, with various cavalry units accustomed to the old battles, and no one could fully control a border army. Typically, two or three major families would balance and ally with each other, but rivalries like that of the Yuan and Cao families also existed. If it weren't for the national teacher Cui Zhan, the civil officials of the Great Li would have had no chance to shine. Even though the embroidered tiger had managed the court for a hundred years, last year it led to a major embarrassment. One of the southern expeditionary cavalry’s envoys came to the capital demanding funds, only to be received by a department vice-minister, whose rank was higher than his. The department had to follow protocol—first lamenting their financial woes, then claiming poverty, and finally spreading their hands in defeat. If there was some connection to the officialdom’s ties, they might express some heartfelt words of effort in private, but if there was no relationship, it was a matter of indifference; they could just as easily storm into the department if they dared.

The individual demanding funds from the department was not well-connected. After enduring their excuses, he finally lost his temper and slammed the table, glaring at the vice-minister, cursing vehemently. He laid out the facts of his cavalry's achievements in the southern campaigns and detailed the tragic losses of his soldiers on various battlefields. According to Cui Zhan, this was “how a soldier should speak in a manner that a civil official can understand.” In the end, he questioned the vice-minister’s conscience, asking how he could dither regarding military pay. He detailed how much gold the department held, leaving the vice-minister stunned, who could only lament that this man should have taken a post in the department instead.

Ultimately, the result was that he returned with a full load, along with an unexpected bonus—the vice-minister separately allocated a sum of money, which was not urgent, to the influential cavalry stationed in the capital.

However, before he could leave the capital with good news, he was summoned back, along with the vice-minister and his superior, the official revered as the Great Li God of Wealth, the Minister of Revenue. The three gathered in one room.

In the main seat sat the embroidered tiger, National Teacher Cui Zhan.

At that moment, Cui Zhan sipped tea, smiling, “You all dare to delay the meager funds we owe to our poor scholar? Aren’t you also from scholarly backgrounds? If I remember correctly, Vice-Minister Song Yan was once a village student, so how can you be so unwilling to use those few coins? Is our Great Li really that impoverished?”

Ignoring the trembling vice-minister, Cui Zhan turned to the elderly but vigorous Minister of Revenue, “Mr. Han, who do you blame for Great Li's poverty? Me? Or you?”

To his surprise, the old minister was unafraid, pointing at Song Yan, “How can I blame the National Teacher? I may be old, but I have a great appetite for power. Besides, our department isn’t poor; we have plenty of silver, but we’re just reluctant to spend it recklessly, so it’s not my fault. If there’s blame, it lies with Song Yan. We in the department have handled the funds according to the National Teacher’s requirements, clear and straightforward—not a single coin more or less. But Song Yan has messed things up; a brave man takes responsibility for his actions. Song Yan, come on, show a little backbone as a department official.”

The cavalryman demanding funds widened his eyes, stunned. What kind of behavior was this from high-ranking officials in the Six Departments? Was this any better than the rough men from the border army? 

It seemed that shamelessness in this world had a universal quality. 

Cui Zhan took a sip of tea and smiled at the old minister, “Alright, no need to twist in circles here asking your subordinates for a way out. Song Yan has indeed made a significant mistake, but it’s not enough to lose his position. His performance in the capital has been decent thus far. Just take out three years’ salary and allocate it to the funds.”

Song Yan, whose knees felt weak, was relieved, “I’m willing to contribute ten years’ salary…”

The old minister smacked his forehead, “You foolish idiot, seeking your own demise.”

Cui Zhan remained calm, holding his tea cup, and waved his hand at Song Yan, “This isn’t how an official should behave. After you return, reflect on yourself, calm down, and take some time to learn from the old minister about how to be in office. Don’t always think that just because you can earn money, you can stand in the center of the court.”

The old minister departed the main hall with the relieved vice-minister.

The two wiped their sweat together, and the old minister, furious, kicked the vice-minister's leg, muttering, “If I were thirty or forty years younger, I could kick you out of here.”

The vice-minister could only smile bitterly. Was this really the same old minister who loved to quote classics all day?

The one who had created a ruckus in the Ministry of Revenue swallowed hard; after all, he was a clever individual who could demand silver from the department. He then imitated the old minister's shamelessness, saying, “National Teacher, please don’t kill me; this is my duty.”

Cui Zhan nodded, “You did nothing wrong; in fact, you did well. I will remember your name. Keep it up, and perhaps you will achieve great things in the future. At least you won’t have to make a special trip to the department, gritting your teeth to buy a new outfit that doesn’t disgrace your military status. You can claim the cost of that clothing from the Ministry of Revenue; it isn’t your money to spend but rather a debt owed to you by the civil officials of Great Li. The military funds you obtained from Song Yan, aside from the portion meant for the scholar, can all be taken out of the capital.”

The cavalryman was utterly baffled, “National Teacher, is it really just that simple?”

As for why the illustrious National Teacher of Great Li knew such trivial matters as someone buying clothes, he had no time to ponder.

Cui Zhan smiled, “Of course, it’s more than that. This matter has distracted me, especially since it has left me a bit displeased. Since I can’t lay the blame on you, and Mr. Han is too slippery to give the Ministry of Revenue any chance to be reprimanded, I can only take it out on your commander. On his way south, I plan to discuss some accounts with Su Gaoshan. Tell him that the court, after deducting his achievements in defeating the Nightwalker Kingdom, is somewhat hesitant about the patrol envoy that should have been a sure thing. Next, with both sides advancing against the Zhu Ying Dynasty, he should exert more effort. If he can lead the charge into the capital of the Zhu Ying Dynasty first, it will be a great achievement. He, being from a woodcutter background, likes to chop the dragon throne for firewood, right? I can promise him that chair today—if Su Gaoshan gets there first and sees the high city walls of the capital, that chair, the most valuable one in the central part of Baoping Continent, will be his firewood. Consuming the flames of that chair means the fire python he raises will have a chance to ascend to the Golden Core stage.”

The cavalryman’s face turned ashen. 

This was clearly a push for General Su to risk everything to break into the heart of the enemy!

Cui Zhan set down his teacup, “I have other matters to attend to, and you do as well, so I won’t invite you for tea. A cup or two of tea won’t calm your anxious heart.”

The man hesitated, ultimately abandoning the thought of negotiating further with the National Teacher. His disruptive actions in the Ministry of Revenue had been driven by necessity, a last-ditch effort, and here, it would be meaningless.

 ### Chapter 483: A Full Meal of Cool Breeze

Before leaving, the man mustered his courage and said, “Master Guoshi, could you delay a bit longer? Just let me say one more thing.”

Cui Chan smiled and replied, “That’s already two things.”

The man laughed heartily, “I’ve always heard that the big shots in the court like to speak in vague, clouded terms, leaving us to guess their meaning. Although you, Master Guoshi, do have your twists, you’re not overly complicated. To be honest, even if today’s events have given you some trouble, I still feel quite pleased.”

Cui Chan waved his hand dismissively. “You can boast to others in the future, but don’t go too far. It’s best to avoid those brotherly titles between us.”

The man sincerely admired him, clasping his fists in respect. “You truly are a celestial being, Master Guoshi.”

It was hard to imagine that a border soldier, just last year, had gone to the Ministry of Revenue over a paltry sum, and that this seemingly unrelated matter would ultimately influence the fate of tens of thousands of wild cultivators in Shujian Lake.

The main general of the Great Li Iron Cavalry, Su Gaoshan, had one thought in his head for an entire year: he was broke, desperately broke.

Especially after charging straight into the territory of the vassal State of Shihau under the Zhu Ying Dynasty, capturing it posed no difficulty. However, after weighing the military strength of Cao Ping, Su Gaoshan felt disheartened; that pretty boy seemed to have the better chance of claiming the glory of conquering the capital of the Zhu Ying Dynasty.

One couldn't just let oneself die from holding in their urine, especially someone like Su Gaoshan, a high-ranking general with real power. Therefore, within all established norms, he needed money—he needed celestial money even more.

So he set his sights on Shujian Lake.

He personally sent someone to Chishui City to meet with Tan Yuanyi of Grain Island.

For Su Gaoshan, it didn’t matter who became the leader of Shujian Lake—Liu Zhimao or Ma Zhimao—as long as they provided enough funds. With sufficient silver, he could hasten his advance southward, supporting whoever was in charge. Those wild cultivators, who were like rats in the street, would have no say in the matter. This time, as he marched south, he was prepared to level not just the earthly immortals but also over forty major peaks of the established celestial masters. 

Currently, excluding the secret scribes provided by Great Li, he had over two hundred cultivators gathered under his command. That was just a fraction of the number he could attract; otherwise, it would have long exceeded a thousand. Furthermore, if he was planning a major battle, behind his mighty army lay the celestial masters who had either been defeated or acknowledged as vassals by Great Li—those who had bowed to him would have to come rushing to his aid at Shujian Lake.

Moreover, within his army, there were specialized giant sword ships crafted by the Mo family’s mechanists, capable of launching thousands of flying swords in a single volley.

It was all about money, and it was a hefty amount of celestial money. Each time he used a sword ship, Su Gaoshan felt as if someone had carved flesh from his heart.

Whenever he heard the civilian officials calculating the costs of deploying the sword ships, saying it was a loss, Su Gaoshan wished he could tear down the ancestral halls of those old masters to sell for funds, digging three feet into the ground to scavenge again. If he happened upon a hidden treasure, perhaps they could break even or even turn a profit. This sort of thing had indeed happened during his journey south, and not just once. Those old mountain cultivators were like mice digging holes, each hiding deeper than the last.

Thinking of the wild cultivators at Shujian Lake, who had saved up their wealth over hundreds of years, Su Gaoshan nearly felt embarrassed to approach that pretty boy, Cao Ping, to borrow a few sword ships.

As a powerful general of Great Li, Su Gaoshan preferred to keep things straightforward.

However, for Tan Yuanyi of Grain Island, who was used to calculating gains and losses on the edge of a blade, encountering someone like Su Gaoshan—one of the top ten figures among the border generals and a future patrol envoy—was both a joy and a headache.

The surplus from Grain Island over the past years, along with a little celestial money earned from Qingzhuang and Tianmou Island, amounted to just a drop in the bucket compared to the military expenses required by the rapidly expanding Iron Cavalry.

Su Gaoshan, relying on war to fund war, could no longer sustain this. After all, along the way south, besides the thunderous hooves of the Great Li Iron Cavalry, there were also the military supervisors and civilian officials responsible for cleaning up the aftermath, who would do their utmost to prevent excessive exploitation of the defeated territories. In this, Master Guoshi Cui Chan had long established a set of intricate guidelines. Whether the border generals liked it or not, it didn’t matter; they had their aides to clarify things, and once they violated the rules, they had to pay a price. 

Military achievements could offset the consequences as long as they were substantial enough. If a general faced a stubborn city that resisted and suffered severe losses, once they finally succeeded in breaching its walls, they could order a massacre. Not only could they kill the two-legged beings, but they could also wipe out pigs and dogs without a trace. However, such an act of venting one’s frustrations by flouting the Southern Campaign Regulations would lead to the military supervisors and remaining civilian officials merely offering advice; they wouldn’t press charges or initiate impeachment. After all, this situation still fell within the guidelines set by Master Guoshi. 

If a general had sufficient military exploits, they could simply consult the regulations book, tally the military achievements accumulated through slaughter, and calculate the costs of the city massacre. As long as they were willing to sacrifice some military contributions and didn’t mind missing out on a newly established official title of “Patrol Envoy,” they could do as they pleased. The Great Li court would definitely not hold it against them later.

But if one’s military contributions were lacking, and they dared to indiscriminately slaughter the city or execute surrendered troops, they would be dealt with swiftly—with execution. The military supervisors could directly command the secret scribes among the troops, even the trusted ones beside the main general, to obey orders from the token given by Master Guoshi. They would execute the general who ordered the massacre on the spot, ensuring that their head was presented to various Great Li border armies. One head wouldn’t suffice; the families back in Great Li would help make up for it, until it was enough. If even that wasn’t sufficient, it wouldn’t matter. Master Guoshi had already said that it would be considered Great Li showing leniency for the years of service in battle.

But what if Liu Laocheng didn’t appear?

This deal would have been a win-win situation for Tan Yuanyi, Liu Zhimao, General Su Gaoshan, and Great Li.

Then Liu Laocheng, who hadn’t shown his face in Gongliudao for two hundred years, popped up.

Thus, Liu Laocheng’s disruptive presence caused Liu Zhimao to lose control over Shujian Lake overnight. Tan Yuanyi’s fate wouldn’t be much better than that of Gu Can and that creature from Qingxia Island, both victims of unforeseen disasters.

At this moment, Liu Zhimao sat quietly, observing with a detached demeanor, as if in deep meditation.

Chen Pingan slightly raised his hand, rubbing his palms together. “Island Master Tan, what’s your relationship with that Great Li general, Su Gaoshan, who’s attacking Shihau?”

Tan Yuanyi replied candidly, “Our relationship is rather ordinary. What Su Gaoshan is interested in is the tribute and mercenary money from the over a thousand islands of Shujian Lake. If I can’t provide that, he could turn hostile at any time—even I, who am half one of his own, might not be exempt. Although military generals cannot interfere with the affairs of Lübo Pavilion, there are over a dozen spies like me within it. Not to mention there are equally capable organizations like the Niuma Pen and the Tongren Dongluo Terrace, which are no less significant than Lübo Pavilion.”

Chen Pingan chuckled. “What’s worse is that Lübo Pavilion was originally crafted by that lady herself. Though it has now become the adopted child of the Great Li Guoshi, it still isn’t her biological offspring. The most unfortunate part is that another spy within Lübo Pavilion who holds a position equivalent to yours, Island Master Tan, is bound to have a smoother path of promotion than you, while seasoned officials like yourself will find it a bit tougher.”

Tan Yuanyi smiled. “When it comes to Niuma Pen and Lübo Pavilion, Master Guoshi certainly won’t show favoritism.”

Chen Pingan pointedly remarked, “When it comes to Niuma Pen and Lübo Pavilion, of course, there will be no favoritism. However, will there be favoritism towards every senior insider of Lübo Pavilion promoted by that lady? It’s possible Master Guoshi has a broad mind and won’t, but it’s also possible he doesn’t have that much tolerance and will. Perhaps today, in times of chaos, he won’t, but tomorrow, when peace is restored, he might. Perhaps today, one has submitted a letter of loyalty, drawing a clear line with the lady, but tomorrow, they could suddenly find themselves in disaster, implicated by someone not too bright. It all seems possible.”

Tan Yuanyi sighed, not rebutting.

Liu Zhimao maintained a nonchalant demeanor, appearing as if he were an outsider.

Chen Pingan sighed inwardly as well.

For Tan Yuanyi, whether or not to break the deadlock held significance, but it was not substantial.

Nonetheless, even so, knowing the result would not be satisfactory before starting a negotiation made tonight’s discussion a necessary step.

Chen Pingan needed to sift through the subtle clues revealed by Tan Yuanyi, uncovering each small truth to clarify his doubts, and then summarize the seemingly vague but traceable currents of the overall situation.

Chen Pingan smiled. “The situation isn’t too favorable, but it’s in adversity that friendships are forged. Island Master Tan, Island Master Liu, shall we act as sincere allies this time? Let’s start discussing the details and steps? Let’s check for any gaps together?”

Tan Yuanyi straightened slightly, speaking earnestly, “If Mr. Chen is willing to offer a peach, I will certainly return a plum!”

Liu Zhimao chimed in, smiling. “That sounds wonderful!”

———

In the dead of night, Chen Pingan left Hengbo Mansion alone and returned to the mountain gate of Qingxia Island. He put away the charcoal basket that had long since extinguished, hung up his sword nurturing gourd, changed into a golden robe, and then donned a thick blue cotton cloak. Drawing the sword from the door, he sheathed it on his back and walked directly toward the ferry, untying the ropes of a small boat, setting off for Gongliudao.

The waterway was long.

Yet Chen Pingan was not in a hurry. With a pole in hand, he propelled the boat through the water, like an arrow flying across the surface.

Shujian Lake was vast, and even though the boat sped like a swift bird, by dawn, there was still no sign of Gongliudao.

Heavy snow fell, and birds flew overhead.

After resting for a moment, Chen Pingan stopped the boat at a tranquil spot in the lake, holding a chopstick, placing it over a white bowl, and gently tapping it, creating a soft, melodic sound.

He listened closely.

He resembled both a street beggar asking for alms and a young immortal who had retreated to the mountains, living like a wild crane.

Chen Pingan savored this moment for a stick of incense, before finally putting away his bowl and chopsticks.

He rubbed his cheeks and took a deep breath.

A full meal of cool breeze!

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 484: Scholar Meets Soldier

Outside of Sui Mountain.

A quietly arrived Grand Scholar of the Academy was still patiently waiting for a response. Even the golden-armored deity felt a twinge of sympathy. A promising scholar, who had hopes of becoming a vice leader in the Confucian Temple, was left hanging for over half a month by an old scholar who had even smashed a statue. If word got out, the flood of indignation from scholars across the realm would likely drown Sui Mountain.

At the peak of Sui Mountain.

Regarding the stir from the Confucian Temple, the old scholar remained unfazed. Each day, he spent his time at the mountaintop, contemplating the situation, venting his frustrations, appreciating the inscriptions, and meandering about. As the Great Deity of Sui Mountain put it, the old scholar was like a fly that couldn’t find any dung to feast upon. Far from being offended, the old scholar clapped a hand on the deity's golden armor and cheerfully declared, "That’s a good one! When I see the old man next, I’ll tell him this is your final word on those Confucian Temple scholars."

The Great Deity of Sui Mountain wore a cold expression. "If you dare say that, you can forget about coming back to Sui Mountain."

The old scholar quickly spat into his palm and wiped it across the golden armor. "You don’t even understand a joke; you’re not funny at all."

The deity, known for his notoriously bad temper, remained still, holding his sword and gazing into the borders beyond Sui Mountain. It seemed he had grown accustomed to the old scholar’s antics. One could tell from this that over the years, he had suffered at the hands of the old scholar to the point of becoming numb to it.

The old scholar scratched the back of his head while standing next to the golden-armored deity. "As a teacher, you’ll never know which words you’ve spoken, which principles you’ve taught, or what actions you’ve taken that will truly be etched in the hearts of your students for a lifetime. If one considers themselves a true scholar, dedicated to enlightening the masses, there’s a deep-seated fear that lingers within. I’ve been trapped in this immense dread for many years, unable to escape. In the end, I feel disheartened because I discover my disciples all have various flaws. Most likely, they are all my doing."

The golden-armored deity sneered, "So it’s not only the mediocre who suffer needlessly."

The old scholar jumped up and cursed, "I warn you, don’t think just because we have a good relationship, you can start talking like those fake scholars with your cryptic nonsense! Don’t you know that’s what I hate the most? I’ve tolerated you for hundreds of years! If you don’t change that horrible temper of yours, I will really just stay here every day to annoy you."

The golden-armored deity chuckled, "I’m terrified."

The old scholar muttered, "When a scholar meets a soldier, reason cannot be made clear."

The golden-armored deity asked, "Based on your deductions, is Cui Chan beating around the bush in Baoping Continent, scheming against that child? Besides wanting to pull Cui Dongshan to his side, does he have a larger conspiracy?"

The old scholar smiled slyly, "As a person who knows the heavens and the earth, of course, I know Cui Chan’s true ambitions, but I refuse to say."

The golden-armored deity nodded, "Then I beg you not to say anything."

The old scholar sighed, gently plucking a hair from his head and handing it to the Great Deity of Sui Mountain beside him.

The golden-armored deity frowned and asked, "What for?"

The old scholar replied sternly, "For you, the stubborn blockhead who refuses to learn, take this hair and hang yourself."

The golden-armored deity smiled, "Are you trying to find an excuse to back down? If you anger me, I’ll just slice you out of Sui Mountain’s territory with one sword strike, and you’ll have to face that Grand Scholar."

The old scholar clicked his tongue, "You’re not as foolish as I thought."

The expression hidden behind the deity’s mask suddenly grew serious. "Are the major events you’ve been deducing still unclear?"

The old scholar gathered his mirth. "It’s quite troublesome. That ancient pass, even if I personally intervene, it would help somewhat, but it’s extremely slow, and far water can’t quench nearby fire. So, I feel a bit uneasy about meeting that Grand Scholar from the Academy at the Sui Mountain border. The biggest issue is that this wild frontier is genuinely on the move. There are several seemingly born geniuses over there. The contest at the Sword Qi Great Wall was merely a small trial for those young fellows, yet it was already quite impressive! That’s why I need to go to Posha Continent and find that stubborn fellow to remind him not to accidentally meet his end and be cursed for a thousand years."

The golden-armored deity was about to speak when the old scholar shook his head. "Heavenly secrets cannot be leaked. I no longer trust the Yin-Yang scholars from the Lu clan in the Central Plains. I have nearly reversed all their calculations just to listen."

The golden-armored deity said, "Bai Ze over there, the Grand Scholar of the Rites Academy, hit a wall. On the overseas islands, the Grand Scholar of the Ya Sheng lineage fared even worse. I heard he didn’t even get to meet anyone. In the end, this one, too, faced a closed door. All three Grand Scholars of the three Academies have had such bad luck. What’s going on? Have you Confucians really sunk so low? Former allies and kin have all chosen to sit on the sidelines, watching the world crumble?"

The old scholar lamented, tugging at his beard, "Heaven knows what the old man and the Sage of Rites are thinking."

The golden-armored deity scoffed, "Aren’t you the one who prides yourself on being clever?"

The old scholar shook his head, speaking seriously, "In true major matters, one never relies on cleverness. It relies on… foolishness."

The golden-armored deity retorted, "With such nonsense, you've taken all the rights and wrongs of the world upon yourself."

The old scholar continued to shake his head. "No, this isn’t ambiguous nonsense. You don’t understand. It’s not that you aren’t clever; it’s because you aren’t part of the human world. Standing only on the mountaintop, do the joys and sorrows of the world concern you? A bit, but they can easily be ignored. This leads you to find it hard to truly empathize with smaller matters. But you must understand, with so many people in the world, when small matters accumulate, they can surpass even a hundred Sui Mountains. I ask you, if in the end, when storms arrive, we discover that the grand structure built over generations by Confucian sages to shelter the masses from wind and rain looks large and solid but is actually just a house of cards that can collapse at any moment, what will happen to the common people living inside? To say nothing of the countless lives lost under the rubble of collapsed buildings, the many displaced, and the numerous sufferings endured. Should we rely on Buddhist teachings to comfort ourselves? I can’t do it."

The golden-armored deity shook his head. "Don’t ask me."

The old scholar stamped his foot and gazed into the distance. "Every scholar who ascends to a high position should reflect deeply on what conscience truly is."

The old scholar murmured, "When granaries are full, one understands rites; such wise words, why don’t you listen? Must we continue to let that old fellow Daozu mock us Confucians for another ten thousand years?"

The golden-armored deity, having witnessed the two debates of the Three Teachings, understood that the old scholar's words were a shocking argument. Though he considered himself a friend of the old scholar, he felt powerless to win the debate. Yet, in the end, the old scholar managed to convince the other two teachings’ disciples. 

During that all-encompassing debate, there had been a fierce argument about "When the Dao is abandoned, there is virtue; when virtue is lost, there is benevolence; when benevolence is lost, there is righteousness; when righteousness is lost, there are rites. Rites are the thin veneer of loyalty and trust and the root of chaos." 

The conflict of the Three Teachings was not merely three geniuses sitting in high positions and exchanging words; its impact on the entire human world was profound and far-reaching.

The golden-armored deity sensed the rare disappointment of the old scholar beside him and felt a pang of compassion. He sought a lighter topic. "Does Qi Jingchun really have no backup plan? Chen Ping’an is the closed-door disciple he helped you select."

The old scholar shook his head. "Interfering to help Xiao Ping’an break through this situation would be a low move. Qi Jingchun wouldn’t do that; it would be equivalent to losing to Cui Chan from the very start."

The golden-armored deity shook his head, helplessly saying, "The human heart is so muddled, which is why you have your cultivation path. Why would Qi Jingchun seek trouble for himself?"

The old scholar suddenly laughed, shaking his sleeves and standing with his hands behind his back. "That’s why you deities will never understand why the human world, despite being so murky and miserable, is also so grand and beautiful. As long as a person lifts their head, they can see it; perhaps most people only take a glance and then lower their heads to continue working, but it ultimately inspires a small group to ponder, discuss, and take action!"

The old scholar suddenly raised his arm, pointing high towards the heavens. "I overlook the world; I treat the world kindly!"

After a moment of silence.

The golden-armored deity remarked, "The old man you speak of… should not be able to hear your grandiose words."

The old scholar stomped his foot in frustration, angrily saying, "What a waste of my passionate, heartfelt emotions!"

 ### Chapter 485: The World’s Affairs Are All Like Mustard Seeds (Part 1)

In the grand towers of the Fan family in Lake Pool City, there was now an empty silence. This towering observation pavilion, once the pride of the Fan family, had been the first choice for guests visiting the city. However, now the Fan family had locked it down, forbidding anyone from entering, as if they were closing their doors to visitors. The streets outside were devoid of the usual bustling crowds.

Fan Yan stood below the pavilion today, as the true master of the Fan family. In the past, if he had issued a decree forbidding entry, he could have broken his own rules and enjoyed the view of the lake from his own building. But now, he dared not do so.

This "foolish young lord" of Lake Pool City, who had deceived nearly everyone, was still in a state of shock, as if his heart had been carved up with a knife. The mere thought of that knife, especially the person wielding it, made his heart ache. Just recalling that person and the blade was enough to give Fan Yan a splitting headache.

On the day that Cui Dongshan left Lake Pool City, it had not yet begun to snow. However, Fan Yan faced a storm in his life that felt like it could freeze him to death. Even now, he felt a bone-chilling cold.

That day, Cui Dongshan had called for Fan Yan.

Before that, Fan Yan had received numerous loud slaps from his parents on the top floor. After leaving, he had forced his own parents to slap each other in front of him in the Fan family’s secret chamber. Blood flowed from their mouths, their faces bruised, and they didn’t dare utter a word of complaint.

Just a few days later, Fan Yan went to "pay respects" to the young man in white.

The two stood together, leaning on the railing and admiring the scenery.

Cui Dongshan hopped up and sat on the railing, beginning to share what he called his "heartfelt words," which made Fan Yan’s heart race with fear. But Fan Yan dared not ask him to stop; he could only listen.

Cui Dongshan said, “Ignorance is a comfortable and blissful state. When a person rises higher and becomes smug, it feels even more wonderful. Because they understand nothing of fortune or misfortune, they simply endure. If they can weather it, they become heroes; if they cannot, they curse the heavens. I’m not saying this is wrong. In fact, I sometimes envy those who exist in these two states.”

“I once traveled far and wide with my first teacher. One time, while visiting a street-side bookstore, I encountered three young scholars. One was from a noble family, one was poor, and one, though dressed modestly, had a certain refined air. All three were participants in the county examinations, and there was a young lady nearby looking for books.”

“The wealthy scholar, wishing to catch the attention of the beautiful lady, casually pulled out a book and began to boast. The poor scholar, feeling a bit intimidated, couldn’t help but admire him; after all, a poor student rarely had the chance to read many books.”

“The bookstore owner, a down-and-out scholar, had endured this for a while before he could no longer hold back and spoke up.”

He pointed at the wealthy scholar and said, “I come from a family of prestige in the county. My family has a deep academic background, and I’ve had esteemed teachers since childhood. I’ve read the classics of various schools of thought. Do I need you to teach me how to be a person? What are you even worth?”

“My poor teacher took on the role of peacemaker. He believed everyone could make mistakes, and even if they did, they could be corrected. He persuaded the bookstore owner not to be angry, saying there were many principles to consider, and everyone had their own. He gently pressed down on the scholar’s finger and said, ‘It’s inappropriate to speak to others like this. Even if you have a point, it just sounds unreasonable.’”

“That scholar had a fiery temper and slapped my teacher’s hand away, cursing him to go cool off.”

“My teacher, of course, didn’t get angry. Then the young man who appeared the most refined and scholarly smiled and said three words of reason. The first was, ‘This is a bookstore, and we are here to buy books. Be careful not to be kicked out before you find the books you want.’ Fan Yan, do you understand the cleverness here? It lies in the confusion of order. He didn’t start with the customs of the place; instead, he assumed that the bookstore is the owner’s domain. If a customer gets kicked out, that’s ‘reasonable.’ Is it really reasonable? Anyone else wouldn’t think so. So following this line of reasoning, the owner became the unreasonable party. If someone else didn’t know the context and just heard this statement or stumbled upon the scene of the owner kicking someone out, would they even care about right or wrong? Of course not; in life, who has the time to explore these nuances? They just want to see the spectacle. Hearing this, I found it amusing and thought this guy was quite clever.”

“The second was, ‘Old sir, perhaps you’ve found the book you want to buy. Don’t be biased towards the owner because of that; if you do, it would disgrace literature. I see you’re also a scholar; why act so lowly? Why flatter a bookseller?’ Isn’t that even more interesting? Anyone who speaks up for the owner while being an outsider is seen as a flatterer. Some bystanders, even if they disagree, would still feel a bit uneasy, right?”

“The third was, ‘If the owner truly had great knowledge and wisdom, why would he be here selling books for money? Shouldn’t he already be in a high position or creating lasting literature?’ How’s that? A bit heart-wrenching, right? This actually presupposes two things: one, that the principles of the world are supported by status and reputation, which means this bookseller has no right to speak of sage-like principles. The second is that only those who achieve success and fame are deemed worthy of principle; principles are found only in the sacred texts, not in the bustling streets or the pleasant-smelling bookstores, where no principles exist.”

“Guess what happened? My teacher slapped that clever scholar across the face. It was the first time I saw my usually kind teacher not only get angry but actually curse someone. He berated that poor fellow, saying, ‘From your parents to your teachers, and even in the sacred texts, you should have learned at least one or two good principles. Instead, you’ve turned your eyes to cow dung and stuffed your belly with dog’s waste?!’”

“Now that guy was dumbfounded. Do you want to know what happened next? The one who was hit lost all his courage, his eyes filled with deep hatred, plotting his revenge. Meanwhile, the wealthy scholar and the awkward scholar rolled up their sleeves, ready to beat up my teacher. What could my teacher do? He ran. What could I do? I ran after him.”

“After running a long way, we finally stopped. My teacher turned back, saw they weren’t pursuing us, and first burst out laughing. But then, as he continued laughing, he suddenly stopped. That was the first time I saw my teacher show such disappointment.”

“On our way back, my teacher was silent for a long time. Finally, he found a wine shop on the street, ordered a pound of wine, and while happily drinking, he spoke of his frustrations. He said that the disputes over knowledge between scholars, the common quarrels in the streets, and the debates about principles between people—all depended on the attitude with which one approached reason. If the attitude is good, that’s the best outcome; if not, even if they don’t listen to others, it’s not a big deal. In the end, it all becomes clearer after debate. Even if a quarrel turns one red in the face, that’s not a bad thing. So in the bookstore, the young man’s bad temper wasn’t really a fault; both he and the owner were just talking past each other, each expressing their own heartfelt views. As someone who teaches, listening to them express their reasoning, no matter their intentions or character, still brought me joy. Yet the one who spoke last, his words were the most cutting and his heart the worst!”

“My teacher, who rarely judged anyone’s character, slammed the table and declared that guy had serious character flaws! Such a person, cloaked in Confucian robes, only seeks personal gain. The more they read, the more they become a scourge. When faced with matters, they prefer to hide in the shadows, subtly scheming and speaking vile words. They calculate everything, weighing benefits and drawbacks. Either they lack the guts to do anything, or if they gain courage, it’s usually calculated. Thus, when they truly set out to do something bad, they can profit more than anyone else. A person like that, if allowed to climb higher year after year, without needing to say anything, will influence their family, friends, and the entire atmosphere of the officialdom, possibly even the moral fabric of the whole nation. All could suffer.”

“Those who still wish to discuss and listen to reason, regardless of their size or character, can actually be taught and saved. If that fails, those who become wise and virtuous, especially us who’ve had bad luck and feasted on cold pork head meat, should work harder to patch up this world.”

“If everyone in the world were like that third type of self-serving scholar, I think the old man was right to scold the Dao Ancestor. The old man was not wrong to be scolded; he should never have spoken those principles aloud, written them in books, and taught them to the world!”

“We Confucians have too many principles, each contradicting the other. The principles in this book are negated by that book, and the principles in that book render others worthless. This leaves the common people feeling lost. That’s why I always advocate that in arguments, one should never think they have all the reason on their side. Even if the other party speaks well, even in the disputes among the three teachings, I still listen attentively to the paths of the Buddhists and Daoists. When I hear something insightful, I smile because I’m hearing such good reasoning. Shouldn’t that make me happy? Is it embarrassing? Not at all!”

“Principles that are too lofty might lead common people to believe that only scholars can speak of them. Yet principles aren’t just found in books; even a child can articulate good reasoning. Even an uneducated villager can act upon the best principles. Even a bookstore owner who hasn’t achieved fame might say something incorrect now, but could later utter something that would make even the old man and the Sage of Rites smile in agreement.”

By this point, Cui Dongshan spoke lightly.

Upon hearing this, Fan Yan had a single thought: he was doomed.

After confirming that Cui Dongshan would no longer recount that "old story," Fan Yan suddenly knelt down, hitting the ground with a thud, and remained silent.

Cui Dongshan turned his head, the young man in white with a mole on his brow, truly charming and carefree.

He smiled and said, “You scholars of Lake Pool, don’t you all enjoy the thrill? As long as I have a reason that can convince myself, I can act without remorse. With a fist as strong as mine, can I just kill whoever I want? What’s so hard about that? It’s hard to be a good person in this world, but being a bad person? Even a child can do that. The slightly more difficult part is just being a clever bad person. So let me ask you, if you were to learn from me, seeking the thrill of Lake Pool, and if I were to squash you like an ant, would you be thrilled right now?”

Fan Yan lay prostrate on the ground, trembling as he spoke, “I implore the esteemed National Master to use your immortality techniques to erase this memory from my mind. And as long as you are willing to exert effort, I am willing to offer half of the Fan family’s fortune.”

Cui Dongshan leapt down from the railing, “You’re quite clever. I almost can’t bring myself to kill you. What do you think? With you, Fan Yan, watching over Lake Pool, that’s a good thing. From now on, don’t be a person; just be a dog of the Great Li, and you’ll survive.”

Fan Yan immediately began to bow, the sound echoing in the air. He raised his head, tears of gratitude filling his eyes as he looked at that lofty “young master.” This gratitude came from the depths of his heart, as if he were about to be moved to the heavens.

Cui Dongshan squatted down, shaking his head, “A clever person like you has ended up as a dog; how tragic.”

He patted Fan Yan’s cheek, again and again, with not-so-gentle force, “Don’t you feel your luck is particularly bad, running into someone like me, whose fist is just a bit bigger than yours?”

Fan Yan shook his head vigorously.

Cui Dongshan, curling up, withdrew his hand, looking at the face filled with anxiety and fear, “I suddenly feel a dog, even if it would be obedient in the future, is still somewhat annoying. What should I do?”

Fan Yan remained confused.

Cui Dongshan’s fingers came together and jabbed toward Fan Yan’s brow.

With that jab, Fan Yan would surely lose his soul.

But in a flash, someone appeared behind Cui Dongshan, bent down, grabbed the back of his collar, and pulled him backward. Cui Dongshan was yanked back just in time to save Fan Yan, whose brow was about to be punctured.

Held in that person’s grasp, Cui Dongshan continued to glare at Fan Yan, “Do you know how many old scholars and Chen Pingan there are in this world who have owed you a debt?! Who will pay it back in the future? The monsters that breach the Sword Qi Great Wall?! Come, come, come! Hurry and break in, teach all the fools of the righteous world a lesson! Teach them that there are no free lunches in this world, you bastards! You will have to pay it back! Do you understand?!”

The unexpected guest who stopped Cui Dongshan from killing was none other than Cui Chan, returning to Lake Pool.

This elderly scholar in a green robe said calmly, “If you kill Fan Yan today, it will be very hard for you to ascend to the fifth realm. Also, don’t say childish things. You’re not young anymore. I don’t care if you enjoy acting young and annoying me, but if you act foolishly, I won’t tolerate it, because you still have many things to do.”

Cui Dongshan struggled a bit, and Cui Chan released him, causing him to plop down onto the ground.

Cui Chan waved at Fan Yan, “Get lost. From now on, you should consider what to say and do; otherwise, if he can’t kill you, I will.”

Cui Dongshan leaned on the railing, lost in thought.

Cui Chan then placed a hand gently on Cui Dongshan’s head, “If you don’t hold any hope for this world, you will never be disappointed. You won’t hate bad people, nor will you like good people. And since you happen to be a scholar, and you don’t deny it, you understand the complexities of this world well. So when you’ve considered the best and worst outcomes, along with the consequences you must bear, then go and do it. Therefore, don’t let Chen Pingan be your exception. Once you confuse the two, it may seem genuine, but it will only harm others and yourself.”

Cui Dongshan replied irritably, “Take your hand off me.”

Cui Chan smiled, hands clasped behind his back, gazing at Lake Pool, “Determining good and evil is very difficult; even the old scholars don’t dare to speak casually about it. In this respect, the Buddhist teachings indeed articulate it better. The old scholar admits this, not privately, but in discussions among the three teachings. Do you remember? Several Confucians accompanying the sage turned pale at that moment; the Buddhist and Daoist disciples weren’t scared, but our own people almost were. We’ve heard this firsthand and witnessed it ourselves. That’s why the old scholar is the old scholar. I acknowledge your good reasoning, but you must also recognize mine!”

“After the last debate among the three teachings, what did the old scholar do after winning? This shabby old teacher sat up straight and extended his hands, saying, ‘Please, Dao Ancestor and Buddha Ancestor, take your seats.’”

“And then? After countless ages without meeting, those two truly arrived. The Sage of Rites came too, and the old scholar merely ignored them.”

“What happened next?”

“So the old man’s friend also arrived, and as soon as he did, he isolated the world. Not long after, the old scholar, who had secretly appeared before us, was grinning, tilting his head, and rubbing his ears?”

At this point, Cui Chan stopped speaking.

“Let’s go. The outcome of Lake Pool no longer needs to be seen. There’s something I’ll tell you later. At that time, I’ll share a bigger chessboard than Lake Pool with you.”

Cui Dongshan jumped back onto the railing, extending his hands, mimicking the pose of the old scholar from years ago, but he didn’t utter the words “Please, Dao Ancestor and Buddha Ancestor, take your seats.”

Instead, he declared loudly, “The heavens are high, the earth is vast, and the principles are grand.”

“Humans are like mustard seeds, and affairs are as light as hair!”

Cui Chan smiled, “Three times is enough. I don’t want to hear childish words for a third time.”

Cui Dongshan twisted on his toes, his white sleeves fluttering, placing his hands behind his back, then clenched his fists, bowing as he handed them to Cui Chan, “Guess which one is reason and which one is…”

With a loud thud.

Cui Dongshan was struck and fell into Lake Pool, splashing waves high into the air.

After resurfacing, paddling to the shore, he walked along the lakeside path, his sleeves flying as he gradually moved further away, leaving Lake Pool behind.

Cui Chan, however, did not leave the railing immediately.

He reminisced about the affairs of people from years gone by.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 486: The Affairs of the World Are But Mustard Seeds (Part 2)

As dusk fell, the outline of Gongliu Island (宫柳岛) became vaguely visible. Unlike other islands, which were blanketed in heavy snow, Gongliu Island was lush and green, with hardly a trace of snow in sight. 

This was hardly surprising; one of Liu Lao Cheng's (刘老成) life treasures was the Golden Fire Spirit Seal, a treasure that repelled water and fire. It seemed that Liu Lao Cheng was not fond of snowy landscapes, so he employed celestial techniques to make Gongliu Island stand out in its own unique way. 

Yet, it was hard to imagine that such a vast island could be so empty, with only Liu Lao Cheng as its sole occupant. 

A small ferry boat, no larger than a mustard seed, steadily approached the jurisdiction of Gongliu Island. 

From a distance of a thousand feet, the traveler, known as "the ferryman," pulled out a bamboo pole from the water and hoarsely called out, "Chen Ping An (陈平安) pays respects to Island Master Liu." 

Moments later, although Liu Lao Cheng offered no verbal response, Chen Ping An noticed that the ferry began to move forward on its own, eventually coming to a gentle stop at the island's dock. 

After securing the ferry, Chen Ping An stepped onto the island. The willow trees swayed gently, and even in the depths of winter, the island was vibrant and alive as if it were midsummer. 

Most of the buildings on Gongliu Island were dilapidated and in disrepair. Once chosen as a site for the selection of the leader of the martial world, Qingxia Island (青峡岛) had funded the repair of several main halls on Gongliu Island. 

However, for reasons known only to him, Liu Lao Cheng had attacked Qingxia Island, turning this "good intention" into the subject of ridicule among many wild cultivators from the mountains. Liu Zhi Mao (刘志茂) truly got what he deserved; upon returning to Shujian Lake (书简湖), the first thing Liu Lao Cheng did was pay a visit to Qingxia Island, showcasing the immense face he had gained as the new ruler of Shujian Lake, known as the "Heavenly Monarch of Jiang." 

As Chen Ping An pondered Liu Lao Cheng's whereabouts, the wild cultivator from the Jade Purity realm appeared in his line of sight. He seemed to move slowly, but in reality, he arrived in an instant, walking along the uneven path of Gongliu Island. Chen Ping An followed closely behind him. 

Liu Lao Cheng said, "Since you managed to stop me from killing on Qingxia Island, I’ll give you the chance to say three sentences. If I’m not satisfied, I will send you away." 

Chen Ping An replied slowly, "Two sentences will suffice." 

Liu Lao Cheng, hands clasped behind his back, did not turn, but smiled, "Perfect." 

Chen Ping An spoke, "The Red Su (红酥) from Zhu Xian Mansion (朱弦府), I have persuaded Liu Zhi Mao to lift his unique restrictions. Whether the Island Master borrows her to Gongliu Island or allows her to live a peaceful life on Qingxia Island, it’s entirely up to your wishes, Island Master Liu." 

Pausing for a moment, Chen Ping An quickened his pace to walk alongside Liu Lao Cheng, extending his hand to present a jade tablet engraved with the words "I nurture the expansive righteous energy." "This item, I can't dare to gift; it’s inappropriate for it to become the personal possession of Island Master Liu. So I wish to lend it to you, and when the day comes that you reach the realm of immortals, you can return it to me." 

Liu Lao Cheng glanced at the jade tablet in Chen Ping An's palm, his footsteps unbroken. "Is that all?" 

Chen Ping An nodded, remaining silent. 

Only then did Liu Lao Cheng turn to look at Chen Ping An, "You’ve got some cleverness about you." 

Liu Lao Cheng chuckled, "Speak if you wish. Your previous two sentences didn’t convince me, but they were enough to let you walk this distance." 

Chen Ping An then said, "To seek survival, one must be blunt, and to live well thereafter, one must be wise and strategic." 

Liu Lao Cheng grunted in acknowledgment, "Similar to my views from years ago." 

Liu Lao Cheng asked, "If you were to leave empty-handed, I can answer you one question. What do you wish to ask? Why kill Gu Can (顾璨)? That would be unlikely; you, this accountant, aren’t so foolish. Why not give any face to the Tian Tan Yuan Yi (天谭元仪) of Li Zu Island (粒粟岛) and the soldiers of the Great Li (大丽) to the north? That’s a more valuable question you could ask. Go ahead, ask away, but after this, don't come here again to test your luck; next time I might not be so patient." 

Chen Ping An inquired, "Will the Island Master personally kill Red Su?" 

Liu Lao Cheng halted his steps. 

Chen Ping An almost simultaneously stopped. 

Liu Lao Cheng pointed at the sword-raising gourd hanging by Chen Ping An's waist. "Asking such a damned question, don't you need a drink for courage?" 

Chen Ping An indeed took down the gourd, "I’ll remedy that." 

Liu Lao Cheng shook his head and continued walking, "Alright, I’ll tell you straightforwardly, this is something I promised you. It's simply a past hurdle; wild cultivators from the mountains often get hurt, suffering serious injuries is common. After being nearly killed countless times, I wouldn’t care about reopening that wound. Red Su, originally named Huang Han (黄撼), was my direct disciple and later my partner. Red Su is just a nickname Liu Zhi Mao used, as he preferred to tease her with cleverness, leaving her with such a name that isn’t a real name. Huang Han's talent wasn’t remarkable; among my disciples, she was the weakest. But later, relying on the vast amounts of celestial money I spent, she became a Golden Core Earth Immortal. Her temperament, akin to her real name, was straightforward and direct, unlike other female cultivators, and her heart was vastly different from the rest of the cultivators in Shujian Lake. In the eyes of a wild cultivator like me, her naive and silly demeanor was truly troublesome..." 

As he spoke, Liu Lao Cheng snapped a willow branch and began skillfully weaving it. "I had good talent and even better fortune; in the path of cultivation, I often stumbled and faced losses, yet at crucial moments, I always moved forward smoothly. So I had long reached the Nascent Soul stage. But, against all odds, I fell in love with her, even worse, I let her see it. At first, I avoided her by leaving Shujian Lake, but decades later, I found that the willow branches of Gongliu Island had all been broken by her. I softened a bit, thinking it was better to follow my heart. Previously, I had been too callous, which led me to be unable to reach the upper five realms. Perhaps, quietude would inspire movement, and it could break through my bottleneck, so I formed a partnership with her. Indeed, my bottleneck loosened, but afterward, due to her wanting to be with me more, she sought to extend her life. At that time, she didn’t want to ask me for help, fearing I would look down on her. She found some fragmented secret manuals from who knows where, the methods were too bizarre, and she nearly went mad. I had to spend a large amount of Gu Yu money, causing Gongliu Island to lose half of its savings back then. Thankfully, through much hardship, she became a Golden Core cultivator. However, I soon discovered that her existence was a nightmare for me. I didn't want to kill her to mend the flaw in my heart and reach the upper five realms, so I pushed her onto the throne of the martial leader, then left Shujian Lake. But I was wrong, terribly wrong. Over time, she, whom I had left on Gongliu Island, began to change. Out of fear of death, her Golden Core was half true and half false, leaking from all sides. Her previous shortcut to forming a core through wicked methods had caused her state of mind to deteriorate. With my departure, it only fueled the fire, leading her to become increasingly deranged. Eventually, one day, she left Shujian Lake and crazily searched for me, visiting every place I had ever been. With her temperament, after leaving Gongliu Island and losing the title of martial leader, she endured great suffering along the way. If it weren’t for the two treasures I left her, she might have perished..." 

"For both of us, it was a fortunate thing." 

Liu Lao Cheng, one hand behind him, lightly spun the willow circle, "When I found her, her soul was already fragmented, shattered like countless pieces of porcelain. Even until today, I can't fathom how she managed to hold on until the day I appeared. Had it been a Nascent Soul cultivator, they might not have endured. At that time, she was completely out of her mind, vaguely sensing that I was different from others. She stood there, looking at me with eyes that... do you know what that feeling was? You wouldn’t understand; she was trying her hardest to remember me, as if she were challenging the heavens." 

With a gentle wave, Liu Lao Cheng let the willow circle fall into Shujian Lake. 

Ripples spread across the water, and the grand formation of mountains and rivers quietly activated. 

Liu Lao Cheng's tone grew cold, "At that moment, as a Nascent Soul cultivator on the brink of entering the upper five realms, my Dao heart nearly shattered on the spot, just like the state of her soul. It was only then I realized she was indeed the great opportunity for my path to enlightenment. My choice to follow my heart back then was not wrong. So I severed my heart's demons and personally killed her." 

Liu Lao Cheng chuckled coldly, "But at that time, I was heartless enough yet not perfectly aligned with my own Dao, which led to the existence of the current Red Su. Her soul should have completely dissipated, without a chance for rebirth or reincarnation, and there wouldn’t be any Red Su appearing at Zhu Xian Mansion, only to be used as leverage by that foolish Liu Zhi Mao. Having killed her once, what difference would it make to kill her again?" 

Liu Lao Cheng's expression turned serious, "That moment of leniency nearly caused me to become fodder for the outer celestial demons when breaking through my Nascent Soul bottleneck. That battle was the most brutal fight of my life. The outer celestial demon took on Huang Han's appearance... no, it was her; she was it, the Huang Han in my heart. Above the lake of my heart, my golden body Dharma form was as high as hers; my cultivation was as strong as hers. Yet my mind was damaged while she felt no harm, dispersing and reappearing without end. She fought me to the bitter end, and eventually, she spoke, cursing me, Liu Lao Cheng, as a heartless man, scolding me for killing her again and again for the sake of my path to enlightenment." 

Liu Lao Cheng chuckled self-deprecatingly, "That must have been the first time she cursed me. So to say I killed her once is inaccurate; it was actually a hundred times." 

"Were those encounters perilous?" 

Liu Lao Cheng asked and answered himself, "Compared to what came later, it was like children play-fighting, just a little skin off and they cry." 

"After being killed countless times, she actually stood there dazed, just like back then, staring at me with that longing gaze, as if she were desperately trying to remember. In an almost mystical revelation, she regained a fragment of clarity, blood streaming from her eyes, her face smeared with blood, her heart voice intermittently telling me to act quickly, not to hesitate, to kill her once more, claiming she had no regrets for loving me in this lifetime, only hating herself for not being able to walk with me to the end..." 

"At that moment, my mind was thrown into chaos; I nearly lost my will to live. Was it really worth it, for the sake of reaching the upper five realms and securing a place on the mountain peak? Without her by my side, could I truly be free and divine?" 

"She staggered toward me, her limbs stiff, still desperately repeating three words in her heart, ‘I beg you.’ Finally, she uttered a phrase, ‘Just live for me.’" 

"I went mad and shattered her. The world fell silent." 

"I collapsed." 

"When I opened my eyes again, I saw her soaring in the sky, Huang Han, graceful and ethereal, ribbons dancing around her. She said nothing, but her eyes conveyed everything; all her struggles and profound feelings were merely an act." 

Liu Lao Cheng fell silent, refraining from sharing the final outcomes with Huang Han or the outer celestial demon, but turned his gaze. 

He then saw a young man, furrowing his brow and staring into the distance, his lips slightly trembling. 

Liu Lao Cheng chuckled and shook his head, "Looks like you have a girl you fancy. Just a little empathy, and you can’t take it." 

The two continued walking, and Liu Lao Cheng reflected, "The reason I share this with you is that I’ve let go. Moreover, you will uncover Red Su's origins and the true reason for your visit to Gongliu Island. Everyone in Shujian Lake would surely never guess it was for a trivial pawn. As for the answer to your question, I can tell you, whether Red Su or Huang Han, she must die; otherwise, my bottleneck in reaching the realm of immortals would pose a great calamity. Even if it’s just ‘what if,’ I would kill her with my own hands. In the path of Dao, what is often termed as ‘what if’ usually encompasses everything. At that time, you can try again to see if you can stop me. As for whether my killing you would be as tragic as Du Mao’s (杜懋), haha, as a wild cultivator from the mountains, who hasn’t scavenged like a wild dog beneath the feet of the celestial masters, eating their leftovers while being beaten half to death? Did I not manage to reach the upper five realms back then? Would I now dare not?" 

Chen Ping An remained silent. 

The old cultivator, who had been anything but the "Island Master Liu of Shujian Lake," now turned imposing, "If you dare to say you want to try, I’ll kill you on the spot." 

"If you think to use Red Su as a stepping stone to scheme against me, to achieve some hidden agenda, only to be driven to a dead end and immediately choose to give up, do you really think I, Liu Lao Cheng, am as foolish as Liu Zhi Mao? I won’t directly kill you, but I’ll make sure you can’t get out of bed for four or five years, all your plans and hard work will go to waste." 

"If you were to approach it differently, assessing the situation, knowing you cannot save Red Su, and choose to let go, yet prepare to make me pay dearly for it, that’s fine. But in this Shujian Lake, right under my nose, being the good guy, playing the hero, you should be ready for my retaliation. Rest assured, it will be much harder than being beaten to the point you can’t get out of bed for years. A dull knife slicing flesh won’t cause heavy injuries, allowing you to walk without hindrance, but it feels almost like being useless. I have all the time in the world to play with you." 

"Chen Ping An, it’s now my turn to ask you: what will you do?" 

Chen Ping An exhaled a breath of turbid air, "Then I choose the third option." 

"You want to kill Red Su; I can’t stop that. But I’ll use this jade tablet to drain half the spiritual energy from Shujian Lake, and then ‘borrow’ the jade tablet and the spiritual energy all at once for someone from the Great Li." 

Chen Ping An looked Liu Lao Cheng directly in the eye, "Although I don’t know why you underestimate the Great Li’s iron cavalry, it shows how extraordinarily you value Shujian Lake. This isn’t just some transaction; it’s the foundation of your Dao. Even if you become an immortal, you won’t abandon this foundation, and you’ll likely convince the Song family of the Great Li to allow you to carve out your territory here. The more so, choosing the third option means you’ll suffer even more." 

Chen Ping An spread his hands, "The jade tablet is right here; why not try to take it? Otherwise, you can kill me now or destroy my last life’s energy mansion. But I’m sorry; the jade tablet has begun to drain the spiritual energy of Shujian Lake." 

The jade tablet, translucent and shimmering, glowed with the inscription, "I nurture the expansive righteous energy." 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 487: All Human Affairs Are Like Mustard Seeds (Part 2)

From all directions, centered around Palace Willow Island, spiritual energy and water currents converged into visible streams, flowing into the six characters inscribed there. 

Liu Lao Cheng's expression was grim.

Chen Ping'an said, "Now it’s your turn to make a choice. Either kill me, and the spiritual energy of the Book Lake will be completely drained, all contained within this jade tablet you can’t even grasp, let alone open or close. Or you can beat me to the brink of death, and I will siphon off half of the Book Lake’s water currents. Alternatively, we could conduct a proper transaction, each stepping back a bit to seek maximum mutual benefit. The prerequisite is that you let me leave Palace Willow Island. Once I safely return to Qingxia Island and activate the restrictions on the jade tablet, it will then be able to 'open a cave dwelling upon my death.' At that point, we can sit down and negotiate again, whether at Qingxia Island or here at Palace Willow Island."

Liu Lao Cheng scoffed, "Do you really think I would believe that you have the ability to control this jade tablet?"

Chen Ping'an's heart stirred slightly, and the jade tablet in his palm gradually slowed its absorption of the heaven and earth's spiritual energy. It no longer surged like a tempest, causing the wild cultivators within a hundred miles of Palace Willow Island to panic, mistakenly believing Liu Lao Cheng was about to ascend to immortal status. They began to act rashly, planning to frantically devour the water currents of Book Lake, leaving no escape for the wild cultivators.

Liu Lao Cheng laughed, "Chen Ping'an, you’re ruthless. You’ve hunted eagles all your life, and yet almost got your eyes pecked out."

The old cultivator waved his hand dismissively. "Once you return to Qingxia Island and settle your matters, we can talk again."

But Chen Ping'an countered, "I think it would be better for you to accompany me back to Qingxia Island. Otherwise, I worry that on the way back, you might sneak off to Qingxia Island. By then, Liu Zhimiao wouldn’t dare to use the mountain and water formation of Qingxia Island to shield the heavenly secrets for me, preventing you, a jade purity realm immortal, from using your powers to observe the mountains and rivers, to see if I really possess the ability to use my life and death as the key to the jade tablet's cave dwelling."

Liu Lao Cheng clicked his tongue in admiration. "How cautious! No wonder you've lived until now. But if that’s the case, aren’t you just exposing your own hand? Otherwise, why worry about my ability to observe the mountains and rivers to verify if you can accomplish this?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "The greater the Dao, the more one must gamble on chance. This is what you, Liu Island Master, said. What if I really did die and gave you an immense surprise?"

Liu Lao Cheng clapped his hands and laughed. "Although I can almost guarantee you don’t have such abilities and are just bluffing, it’s fine. I’m willing to escort you back to Qingxia Island myself. Once there, you can do two things: use those two little trinkets you stole from who knows where to send a message to Liu Zhimiao before we approach Qingxia Island, asking him to open the mountain and water formation. You can make up any reason you like; if you can’t think of one, I can help you out, so he doesn’t even have the courage to open the formation. And then, visit the Zhu Xian residence and bring Hong Su to the vicinity of the mountain gate. I want to see her."

Chen Ping'an asked seriously, "What if you were just pretending to deceive me? If you don’t actually want to kill Hong Su, but when you see her getting a bit too close to me, you get jealous and want me to suffer a bit, what should I do? I can’t just get angry and continue forcing the opening of the jade tablet’s restrictions, nor can I reason with you to seek justice."

Liu Lao Cheng was taken aback, seemingly not having thought of that angle. He shook his head and laughed. "Who taught you to play chess? That Mr. Qi from the Li Pearl Cave who almost tore the heavens apart?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head.

Liu Lao Cheng smacked Chen Ping'an on the head, almost knocking him off balance. "Let’s go. Don’t worry, I don’t have a vinegar jar to overturn."

The old man and the young man set off, with Chen Ping'an rowing steadily, though in Liu Lao Cheng’s eyes, they were slowly making their way back to Qingxia Island.

However, Liu Lao Cheng did not refuse to let Chen Ping'an return in his own way, only teasing, "You really are using every means possible. With such a show of force, after this, who among the wild cultivators at Book Lake would dare to speak against Chen Ping'an?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Make the most of what you have; every bit counts."

Liu Lao Cheng smiled dismissively, not taking it seriously. Sitting at the front of the boat, the old cultivator curiously asked, "Since you have this jade tablet, why not just directly siphon off half of the Book Lake’s water currents? By then, those wild cultivators kneeling and begging for the return of the spiritual energy would number no less than eight thousand."

Chen Ping'an responded slowly, "There are things one should refrain from doing if they wish to achieve something. That kind of method might yield immediate results, but it’s not a long-term solution."

Liu Lao Cheng thought for a moment. "What great ambition! If you didn’t fit into our line of work, you could easily be a lawless wild cultivator. What a pity."

Chen Ping'an fell into a daze.

It seemed he had never considered whether he was indeed a wild cultivator.

He certainly didn’t belong to any sect in the conventional sense.

Liu Lao Cheng suddenly laughed. "You’re not that bold, are you? Wearing a robe beneath your cotton clothes and still sweating profusely?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "I’m not an idiot. When my life hangs by a thread, it’s hard not to feel nervous."

Liu Lao Cheng shook his head. "Not quite the same. I’m curious about your horse-tethering post; what exactly is it? Afraid of death, yet you can still engage in a battle of wits and courage with me."

Chen Ping'an answered, "If it were you, Liu Island Master, back when you just broke through the outer demons, I bet even if you were about to face an ascended cultivator, you would still place your life and death aside."

Liu Lao Cheng smiled. "Seems like you’ve faced quite a bit of hardship at Qingxia Island."

Chen Ping'an used pure true energy to row, deliberately avoiding any intermediate islands’ territorial waters to prevent the jade tablet from absorbing the spiritual energy and affecting the water currents of any island.

Liu Lao Cheng shook his head, unable to watch any longer. "I take back what I said earlier; it seems you’ll never be a wild cultivator in this lifetime."

Chen Ping'an raised a hand, pointing to the sword immortal he carried on his back. "I am a swordsman."

Liu Lao Cheng glanced at the half-immortal weapon. The old cultivator sat at the bow of the boat and casually smashed a nearby island’s mountain gate from several dozen miles away. The sect’s founder, a Golden Core Earth Immortal, was startled and quickly withdrew his hidden supernatural abilities. He hadn’t been spying on the boat and the two of them with his power to observe mountains and rivers, but had stealthily sent a fish with a listening talisman swimming near the boat, intending to eavesdrop on their conversation.

Liu Lao Cheng sat cross-legged. "After so many years, I’ve seen all kinds of people, yet I still can’t understand why so many are drawn to death. People like you and me are so rare."

Chen Ping'an said, "Perhaps in Du Mao's eyes, my actions in Old Dragon City were reckless. In the eyes of certain influential figures, during those unknown years, Liu Island Master would be viewed the same way."

Liu Lao Cheng replied, "Seems similar, but in reality, it’s vastly different."

Chen Ping'an nodded, his expression dim.

Liu Lao Cheng suddenly said, "You dare to come to the island to find me, besides possessing the jade tablet and some mutual knowledge, I guess there are other reasons, right? But I can’t figure it out for now."

Chen Ping'an didn’t hide it and nodded. "A very important reason, one that’s quite trivial."

With nothing better to do, Liu Lao Cheng began to ponder this trivial matter, treating it like a riddle.

Chen Ping'an smiled. "What you can’t guess, don’t waste your effort."

Liu Lao Cheng lightly tapped the boat railing. "I already figured out the answer."

Chen Ping'an was skeptical.

That trivial matter was indeed quite trivial.

In Bee Tail Alley, there was a tall and striking young man who happened to live there, and coincidentally, he was someone Chen Ping'an knew. He was the lucky one who had gained an opportunity from the Iron Lock Well in Li Pearl Cave, and he had informed Chen Ping'an of where to buy the authentic Water Well Immortal brew.

Pei Qian had said before that he was a good person.

Chen Ping'an thought so too.

And Bee Tail Alley was the only place in Baoping Continent where a wild cultivator had reached the fifth realm, Liu Lao Cheng's territory.

The master who could raise such a "good person" disciple might not necessarily be a good person, but he certainly had his own distinct principles, a kind of unbreakable rule.

One must know.

The world is complicated; everyone’s behavior, according to the six major circles Chen Ping'an had divided, shows that human hearts are ever-changing. Yet upon deeper inspection, Chen Ping'an increasingly realized that there might be one or two fundamental threads supporting everything. This is akin to the "contextual barrier" that Cui Dongshan once mentioned and the "origins and endings" that the old Daoist advocated. These concepts share a similar essence. Therefore, if one were to view the negative "contextual barrier" from a different perspective, it could be used to discern human hearts.

Then, applying the teachings of the literary Sage in a sequential manner allows for specific handling of matters.

While these two perspectives hold some conflicts, they also possess greater complementary meanings.

Chen Ping'an’s venture onto the island was to see with his own eyes and hear with his own ears to determine the sixth line of Book Lake.

The thread's beginning lay with Hong Su, and the end was with that tall young man.

Gaining as much knowledge as possible was ultimately a good thing.

The more one knows and considers, the fewer mistakes one would make.

Cui Dongshan once asked at Cliffside Academy, if one were to achieve the correct result through an incorrect method, is it right or wrong?

Even now, Chen Ping'an couldn’t provide an answer.

However, the connections forming within Book Lake had gradually become clearer, revealing how to make fewer mistakes and what mindset to adopt to correct them.

In an indescribable way, that kind of mysterious feeling felt like… the mountain is high and the moon small, the water recedes and the stones emerge.

Liu Lao Cheng asked, "Aren’t you curious why I’m willing to share my 'path to harmony' process with you in such detail? Is it simply because I’ve accumulated so much over the years and can’t keep it in any longer?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "Of course, I’m very curious, but after thinking it over, I can’t come up with an answer, so I’m no longer curious."

Liu Lao Cheng sighed. "A person never knows which connection will bear good or bad fruit."

Chen Ping'an switched to pure true energy, feeling no restraint.

If Liu Lao Cheng truly wanted to kill him, it would be as easy as a snap of his fingers.

The jade tablet, the sword immortal, the sword nurturing gourd, the robe, the martial arts, and sword techniques.

Liu Zhimiao of Qingxia Island, Tan Yuanyi of Grain Seed Island, and the iron cavalry of the Song clan from the Great Li.

And that small matter that emboldened Chen Ping'an to come to the island.

Every little detail, like accumulating soil to form a mountain, brings about the wind and rain.

All of this was to ensure Hong Su's safety, and only then would he think of his own plans.

One must not skip the first step.

Otherwise, Chen Ping'an would be unsettled.

For Chen Ping'an, the concept of friendship could be found in the warmth of spring and autumn, as well as in sacrificing one’s life and forgetting death.

Liu Lao Cheng asked, "Is it worth it for a chance encounter with Hong Su?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "Don’t say it’s you; I myself think it’s not worth it."

Liu Lao Cheng was momentarily taken aback.

Chen Ping'an quickly added, "But I’m happy."

Liu Lao Cheng looked at the young man's eyes, then withdrew his gaze, chuckling as he tapped the railing, not commenting further, merely surveying the surroundings. "When one has free time, they become the masters of worldly pleasures. Only when one truly becomes an immortal will they understand, and they won't have any leisure."

Chen Ping'an hesitated, then asked, "If I were to say something unpleasant, could Liu Island Master be magnanimous?"

Liu Lao Cheng shook his head. "Then just keep it to yourself. I’m not in the mood to listen."

Chen Ping'an indeed held his tongue.

He had wanted to scold Liu Lao Cheng, telling him to stop sitting around here talking as if he were unscathed.

On the small boat, the two fell into silence.

The islands of Book Lake that witnessed this scene or heard the news were already buzzing with excitement.

Liu Lao Cheng, who had been meditating with his eyes closed, suddenly opened them and joked, "Oh? Is your heart unsettled? This is a rare occurrence, Chen Ping'an. What are you thinking about?"

The world was vast and boundless.

A small boat, two mustard seeds.

Chen Ping'an stopped rowing, sat down, resting the bamboo pole across the boat. He took a sip of wine and fell into silence.

Although his current state of mind didn’t allow him to practice martial arts or swordsmanship, this didn’t mean he was giving up.

Quite the opposite; this was the first time Chen Ping'an truly delved into the essence of martial arts and swordsmanship.

Rather than just being diligent in pursuit of results.

At that moment, on the lake outside Yunlou City, when his body and soul were nearly burdened to the breaking point, Chen Ping'an could still strike down a nearby martial cultivator with a single punch. Although limited by his physical state, making the punch was strenuous and left him with many aftereffects, in terms of mindset, Chen Ping'an had never experienced such fluidity from the intent to strike to the punch reaching the enemy. The flow of power had never been so natural.

That was the realm revered by both practitioners of martial arts and chess—where no one stood before oneself.

Chen Ping'an wouldn’t dare claim that he had fully entered this realm, but he had certainly stepped in with one foot and half a foot. This was not arrogance or ignorance of his limitations.

This brought Chen Ping'an a slight sense of reassurance.

When laboring diligently, one should not toil to correct one mistake only to unknowingly commit another.

Otherwise, all the segmentation and definitions in Book Lake would end up being a joke.

After resting for a moment, Chen Ping'an stood up again to row, slowly saying, "Liu Lao Cheng, although I don’t like your character or your way of doing things, your story with her, I find it very..."

Chen Ping'an pondered for a long time but still couldn’t find the right words, so he simply gave a thumbs up to the great cultivator in the jade purity realm and said, "But if I were in your position, I would definitely do better than you."

At this point, the young steward, looking haggard with sunken cheeks, while still holding the bamboo pole to row the boat, suddenly felt tears streaming down his face. "Since you’ve encountered such a good girl, how could you bear to let her down?"

 ### Chapter 488: The Coldness of the Charcoal Stove (Part 1)

As they reached a certain lake, Chen Ping'an stopped rowing the boat, set down the bamboo pole, and pulled out a portion of dried rations from the nearby supplies to quell his hunger.

Suddenly, Liu Lao Cheng smiled and asked Chen Ping'an if he liked fishing. He mentioned that the Book Simplifying Lake had three culinary delights, all of which were exquisite dishes served at the banquets of the Zhu Ying Dynasty's powerful elite. Among these was a type of fish caught during winter, known as the winter crucian carp. The harsher the snow and cold, the tastier this fish became. Liu Lao Cheng pointed to the lake bottom, indicating that they were abundant in this area. Before he could elaborate further, Chen Ping'an had already retrieved the fishing rod from Purple Bamboo Island that he had yet to use and took out a small jar of fermented corn as bait.

Liu Lao Cheng was equally adept, though his bait was slightly different, as his fishing rod was made from a special green bamboo that appeared vibrant and full of spiritual energy.

In the end, Liu Lao Cheng caught three winter crucian carp, each the size of a palm, while Chen Ping'an reeled in two. They both pulled in their lines almost simultaneously, and thereafter each showcased their skills with various utensils—cutting boards, stoves, clay pots, firewood, oil, salt, sauces, vinegar, and sugar, they had it all.

One sat at the bow, and the other at the stern, each preparing their fish.

Steam rose as the two sat cross-legged, one holding chopsticks and the other a wine jug. They exchanged smiles, starting to chat as they ate.

In this moment of levity, amidst the scheming and lurking dangers, they set aside their tensions.

After finishing their meal and cleaning up the stove and clay pots, Chen Ping'an clapped his sword-raising gourd, and fifteen flying swords shot away. Before Liu Lao Cheng, he said, “First, go to Qingxia Island and inform Liu Zhimiao that Liu Lao Cheng from Gongliu Island is with me. Ask him to activate the mountain-protecting array, and I will disembark alone.”

Liu Lao Cheng asked, “You’re just giving orders without making up an excuse? Otherwise, wouldn’t Liu Zhimiao become suspicious?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “The more I say, the less he would dare to activate the array.”

Liu Lao Cheng nodded, “Direct and to the point. Either intimidate the opponent or tear off the mask; that’s the way to deal with someone like Liu Zhimiao. We can't give him any leeway.”

Chen Ping'an's eyes brightened.

Liu Lao Cheng chuckled, “What? Just a casual remark and you’ve gained insight?”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I only vaguely knew I should do it this way before, but it’s not as clear as what you’ve said, Island Master Liu. It’s like you’ve laid a ruler before me. In the past, I’ve always sought a middle ground in human affairs, but you’ve taught me that when dealing with someone like Liu Zhimiao, it’s exactly the opposite; we should push him to the extremes.”

Liu Lao Cheng acknowledged with a nod but added, “Speak with others about seven or eight parts of the truth; don’t lay your whole heart bare. Between us, we’re still enemies. When can we speak candidly?”

Chen Ping'an leaned on the bamboo pole, “That’s a different matter. If I only wanted you dead, I wouldn’t need to come to Gongliu Island. Ultimately, I hope for a win-win situation. Island Master Liu still gets that significant benefit, while I just want peace of mind. I won’t compete with you for profit.”

Liu Lao Cheng remained noncommittal, slowly sipping his wine.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “When I learned to play chess, I had no talent for it. I learned slowly; even a strategy long since figured out by others took me ages to comprehend, and I never grasped the essence. So I like to think randomly, wondering if there’s a chessboard where everyone can win—not just a win or lose, but where both sides can benefit, with only minor differences in gains.”

Liu Lao Cheng shook his head, “Don’t talk to me about chess; it gives me a headache. I’ve never liked it. The skill of chess has nothing to do with doing things well.”

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to speak—likely wanting to engage the old cultivator further—Liu Lao Cheng raised a hand, “Shut up. Don't overstay your welcome. As a mere accountant, you’re not even good at calculations. The boat is this big; if you babble on, I’ll have to throw you into the lake. With your current physique, you can’t withstand much more. Right now, you’re relying on a vital acupuncture point to hold on. If this residence were to break, your Longevity Bridge would likely shatter again. By the way, how did your Longevity Bridge break before? I’m curious.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “It was broken by a female cultivator from the mountain back in my hometown. However, she was mostly manipulated by Liu Zhimiao. That calamity was quite perilous; Liu Zhimiao had meddled with me at that time. If not for some luck, the female cultivator and I would likely have ended up dead without understanding why—a muddled slaughter. You mountain immortals, aside from your vast powers, also enjoy killing without bloodshed.”

This was Chen Ping'an's first time sharing personal matters with Liu Lao Cheng, and it was a show of sincerity. Otherwise, he truly worried he might have angered the unpredictable old cultivator before reaching Qingxia Island.

Liu Lao Cheng seemed to be touched, “Mountain cultivators fear getting entangled in worldly affairs. At Book Simplifying Lake, I should be the one most qualified to say this. That’s why the military cultivators are envied by the other Qi practitioners; no matter how they kill, they fear no karmic retribution. So compared to the Law School, the Vertical and Horizontal School, and the merchants and farmers, they prefer to practice in the mountains. Sword cultivators in the four great mountains are challenging, but they feel more at ease with fewer constraints.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “I’ve seen Law School cultivators and the Daoist from the Sword Room. The only ones I haven’t encountered are the Merchants of the Ink School.”

Liu Lao Cheng scoffed, “I advise you not to provoke the Merchants of the Ink School. They’re the hardest to deal with among the difficult ones, practically the gatekeepers for Yama.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I will be careful.”

The journey was long, but it eventually reached its end. The ferry passed several subordinate islands, including the Plain Scales Island, and arrived in the territory of Qingxia Island, where Liu Zhimiao had indeed activated the mountain's water array.

To Liu Zhimiao, this would certainly provoke Liu Lao Cheng's displeasure. However, he and Chen Ping'an were like grasshoppers on a single line; should he refuse Chen Ping'an's request, he would have to bear the corresponding consequences. Thus, he could only choose the lesser of two evils. Although Liu Zhimiao could not fathom why Liu Laozu would accompany Chen Ping'an back to Qingxia Island, he continuously reminded himself that Chen Ping'an liked to play by the rules. No matter what Liu Lao Cheng wanted to do, the person was brought by Chen Ping'an; he could not handle everything on his own but would at least help tidy up the mess, rather than washing his hands of it.

This was the invisible influence brought by a so-called “good person,” like a spring breeze entering the night, nurturing things silently.

Even someone as notoriously wicked as Liu Zhimiao had to acknowledge this.

Liu Lao Cheng kept his promise, hovering outside the wharf on the lake.

Chen Ping'an secured the ferry rope and went to the mountain gate’s house. After a moment, the jade tablet stopped absorbing the spiritual energy from Book Simplifying Lake.

Chen Ping'an visited Zhu Xian Mansion, but upon returning, he did not bring back Hong Su and returned alone to the wharf.

Liu Lao Cheng frowned.

Chen Ping'an said, “I don’t want to see Hong Su die by my side while I remain helpless; that’s my greatest fear.”

Liu Lao Cheng laughed heartily, giving Chen Ping'an a thumbs up. He then soared into the air, transforming into a streak of rainbow light returning to Gongliu Island, creating a series of rumbling sounds like winter thunder.

Chen Ping'an stood at the wharf for a long while, waiting until Liu Lao Cheng had completely departed before he finally released a sigh of relief and raised his hand to wipe the sweat from his forehead.

Liu Zhimiao arrived at the wharf, smiling wryly, “Mr. Chen, can you tell me honestly what’s going on here?”

Chen Ping'an said, “On the way here, I was chatting casually with Liu Lao Cheng, testing each other out. From that, I came to a conclusion: Liu Lao Cheng seems to have never met the Great Li martial general Su Gaoshan.”

Liu Zhimiao's expression changed slightly.

Both were intelligent men; words spoken with intent would resonate in understanding. Su Gaoshan, the main commander of the Great Li Iron Cavalry, had already killed his way into the capital of the Shihou Kingdom. He was a mountain that even Tan Yuanyi of Li Zuli Island could not surpass. When the three of them allied at Hengbo Mansion, they all thought that Liu Lao Cheng had already established a connection with Su Gaoshan. Thus, they did not even bother discussing major matters with Tan Yuanyi, a mere spy leader from Green Wave Pavilion. They assumed Gongliu Island directly obtained some sort of response from the central authority of the Great Li through Su Gaoshan, which was why they acted so arrogantly, completely ignoring the conditions set by Liu Zhimiao and Tan Yuanyi. If that were the case, Liu Lao Cheng's current position would be roughly equal to that of Su Gaoshan.

Now, it appeared that all three had guessed wrong and underestimated this fifth-layer cultivator. Liu Lao Cheng didn’t even regard the great general Su Gaoshan as significant; Gongliu Island must possess an even higher and more concealed connection, possibly allowing direct communication with the Song clan of the Great Li or even the Grand Master of the Great Li.

Liu Zhimiao’s face grew more bitter, “Mr. Chen, you’re not considering the situation and planning to abandon Qingxia Island for Gongliu Island, are you?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “If I were to do that, I wouldn’t bother telling you this. Besides, Island Master Liu has a keen eye; you must see that my relationship with Liu Lao Cheng, while appearing harmonious, isn’t as good as the Book Simplifying Lake cultivators imagine. It’s not that we hit it off at first sight or wish we had met earlier. I don’t mind telling you, if it weren’t for that jade tablet, which made Liu Lao Cheng wary, Gongliu Island would have almost become my burial place.”

Liu Zhimiao smiled, “Then I can rest easy. If Mr. Chen chose to ally with Liu Lao Cheng, I fear that even if I had two more legs, I wouldn’t be able to escape the Book Simplifying Lake.”

Chen Ping'an joked, “After the new year, I might often leave Qingxia Island, even venturing beyond the borders of the Book Simplifying Lake. You don’t need to worry that I’m secretly conspiring with Tan Yuanyi to carve out a path for myself. However, I might indeed encounter Su Gaoshan on the way. You shouldn’t harbor any suspicions; the alliance at Hengbo Mansion is something I value more than both of you. But let’s agree on this beforehand: if either of you suddenly changes your mind and wants to back out, just tell me directly; we can still negotiate. Once someone betrays the trust first, regardless of the reason, I’ll make sure you suffer the consequences.”

Liu Zhimiao laughed bitterly, “I can only guarantee that if I change my mind, I will definitely inform Mr. Chen in advance. As for Tan Yuanyi, I will relay your words to him at Li Zuli Island.”

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Liu Zhimiao did not deny that when Liu Lao Cheng accompanied Chen Ping'an to Qingxia Island, the more Chen Ping'an spoke plainly and clearly, distancing himself from Gongliu Island, the more uncertain Liu Zhimiao felt, his heart wavering.

Because that was a “what if.”

What if Chen Ping'an's courage and impatience led him to discover another option? What if Chen Ping'an himself turned out to be more ruthless than him and Tan Yuanyi?

He was well aware of how that arrogant little loach had jumped into the pit of fire and suffered, and how Chen Ping'an had ultimately turned the tables.

Suddenly, Liu Zhimiao felt some regret. Should he have never stepped into Chen Ping'an’s “rules”? Would he awaken one day to realize that he had ended up with a fate just like that little loach?

Chen Ping'an clasped his hands in his sleeves, gazing out at the lake and mountains, smiling, “Island Master Liu, you have no choice now, so don’t get distracted, or it will only add to your troubles. This isn’t the mindset a Yuan Ying cultivator should have.”

Liu Zhimiao sighed, “A word to awaken the dreamer; I’ve learned once again.”

Chen Ping'an teased, “I wouldn’t dare to claim that. I’m just a down-and-out accountant from Qingxia Island, reliant on others, and still need you, Island Master Liu, to take care of me.”

Liu Zhimiao joked back, “Sometimes I have wicked thoughts, wondering if it would be better if Mr. Chen suddenly punched someone to death for no reason.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Likewise.”

After Liu Zhimiao left the wharf, Chen Ping'an returned to the house, took down the sword immortal hanging on the wall, removed his ceremonial robe, and donned a thick cotton robe to fend off the cold. He tossed charcoal into the small stove, igniting the coals, and paced around the room for warmth.

Zeng Ye came over to knock on the door to check on him. After Chen Ping'an opened the door, he inquired about Zeng Ye's progress in cultivation. After their chat, Chen Ping'an was somewhat satisfied; he estimated that by the end of the year, Zeng Ye should be able to use his own physique to carry the souls of Yin entities and walk freely in the Yang realm. By then, Zeng Ye could rely on this superior secret technique and his unique roots to refine and enhance his cultivation. Perhaps he would break through quickly, much faster than the harmful shortcuts on Maoyue Island, allowing him to become a true cave-dwelling cultivator crossing the first major threshold of the fifth layer.

Seeing Zeng Ye dawdling and seeming reluctant to leave, Chen Ping'an asked, “Are you curious why I fought with Liu Lao Cheng not long ago, but now we can stroll around Book Simplifying Lake like old friends?”

Zeng Ye felt a bit embarrassed, nodding. Even though he firmly remembered to observe more and speak less on Qingxia Island, the tall youth was genuinely curious and couldn’t hold back.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “It’s a bit complicated and not something to share as gossip or interesting tales.”

Zeng Ye quickly stood up, “Mr. Chen, I’ll go back to my cultivation now.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “When the day comes that I can tell it, you can treat me to a drink, and I’ll share it with you then.”

Zeng Ye gently closed the door, his face full of smiles, and through the last sliver of the door crack, he cheerfully said, “Mr. Chen, it’s a deal!”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 489: The Coldness of the Charcoal Stove (Part 2)

Afterward, the many islands of Bookletter Lake welcomed yet another heavy snowfall, even before the last remnants of snow had completely melted away. It was indeed a curious occurrence; how strange it was that just after a brief interval, two unprecedented snowstorms, rare for decades, had already arrived this year.

However, no one seemed to mind, for this meant that the abundant spiritual energy of the entire Bookletter Lake would receive a boost, a clear sign that the heavens were rewarding them with sustenance.

In recent days, discussions had been rife among cultivators, with nearly all of them buzzing about the accountant from Qingxia Island. This included the four major cities around the lakeside—Chishui, Yunlou, and others, who were not exempt from the chatter.

Yu Huai took the initiative to visit the mountain gate of Qingxia Island for the first time. He sat for a while by Chen Ping'an's residence, making a small deal in the process. He sold Chen Ping'an a high-quality spirit tool that was only a step away from being a magical treasure, at a low price. Its effects were similar to that of the "Underworld" Yama Hall, resembling a loft styled after the "Liuli Pavilion" of the White Emperor City in the Central Lands. Although the number of "houses" that could harbor ghosts and spectral entities was limited to just twelve—far fewer than the Yama Hall that came from Qingxia Island's secret treasury—the quality of these houses was superior enough to comfortably accommodate the ghostly banners cultivated by the soul-repairing ghosts of Zhu Xian Mansion.

Chen Ping'an felt a bit helpless; the items were indeed excellent, but he lacked the funds and could only defer payment to Crescent Moon Island. Upon hearing this, Yu Huai laughed, saying that Chen Ping'an was being unreasonable, asking for a promissory note while getting such a low price—how shameless was that? Chen Ping'an chuckled in response, saying it was no trouble at all, especially with someone like the island master Yu. Yu Huai was even more delighted, but business was business, and he insisted that Chen Ping'an have the treasury administrator, Zhang Ye, issue the promissory note in the name of Qingxia Island. Otherwise, he wouldn’t feel at ease and requested Zhang, the old gentleman, to keep an eye on Chen Ping'an. He joked that he and the treasury would become sworn brothers in hardship.

Zhang Ye smiled and nodded in agreement, refusing to lend Chen Ping'an money to pay for the little Liuli Pavilion, as he knew that Chen Ping'an was already in debt to Qingxia Island. However, he did agree to write up a promissory note, which satisfied Yu Huai, who then casually invited Zhang to visit Crescent Moon Island when convenient. Zhang readily accepted, setting a date without any hesitation.

In the end, Chen Ping'an felt like an outsider in this exchange.

The island master of Zizhu Island arrived radiantly, riding a spirit-powered ferry, bringing with him three tall bamboo stalks from his ancestors. He seemed happier giving than receiving. After a brief visit to Chen Ping'an's house, where he only had some hot water without even tea leaves, he took his leave. Chen Ping'an saw him off to the ferry terminal with clasped fists.

Many others who had previously been turned away or had visited the island without seeing the island master also seemed to have arranged visits to Qingxia Island.

As the heavy snow finally ceased, at noon that day, Liu Zhimo arrived at Chen Ping'an's place. He knocked on the door but did not enter.

Chen Ping'an emerged with the charcoal stove, looking fatigued. The two strolled together.

Liu Zhimo, a bit gleeful, suggested, "Should I step in and help you refuse those folks at the door? Just find any excuse—say Qingxia Island is closing for the season."

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "No need. I find joy in my suffering and am enjoying it. Dealing with these island masters has taught me quite a lot, though it is indeed tiring. Small talk and pleasantries have never been my forte. I see it as a way to fill in the gaps and practice my social skills."

Liu Zhimo chuckled. "Everyone has to go through such a day. Once you have your own mountain stronghold to manage, you'll need to consider all aspects, which will be even more taxing. Getting used to it sooner rather than later isn't a bad thing."

As they walked a considerable distance from the mountain gate, Liu Zhimo glanced back and suppressed a smile. "Chen Ping'an, your aunt has come out of the Spring Courtyard to find you. If I remember correctly, this is the first time she's come to see you since you moved out, shall we turn back?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "Let's walk a bit more."

Liu Zhimo nodded. "If you are really as hard-hearted as we cultivators, then there is no need for such convoluted emotions."

Chen Ping'an held the charcoal stove and replied, "Let's strive for a good parting. Even when the incense has burned out, I still hope she can have a better life."

Liu Zhimo remarked, "Some half-baked family matters, whether it's a shabby house, a grand mansion, or a mountain stronghold like Qingxia Island, it's hard to do good deeds and be a good person. Chen Ping'an, let me give you some advice, even if in a few years or a decade, that woman may not understand your good intentions now. She will only remember your faults. Regardless of whether she is doing well or poorly at that time, it will be the same. Perhaps if she is struggling, she might remember your kindness, but the better she does, the deeper her resentment toward you will be."

Chen Ping'an's expression remained calm. "Does that have anything to do with me?"

Liu Zhimo laughed heartily. "It seems so."

Liu Zhimo suddenly grinned mischievously. "Do you think Gu Can's mother brought a maid or two along with her this time?"

Liu Zhimo quickly added, "Not to stir the pot, of course."

Chen Ping'an pondered. "Is it possible that halfway through, she thought it improper and sent them back to the Spring Courtyard? My aunt is very clever; otherwise, she wouldn’t have managed to raise Gu Can back in Mud Bottle Alley. But... no, there are no buts. She did her best in Mud Bottle Alley."

Liu Zhimo clicked his tongue in admiration. "Impressive!"

Chen Ping'an laughed. "Did I guess right?"

Liu Zhimo nodded. "When she left the Spring Courtyard, she had brought along the two most obedient and pleasing maids. Not long after leaving, she realized this was not the posture one should adopt when seeking pity, and quickly sent the maids back, along with that valuable fox fur. So if we keep going, when we return, she'll definitely be out there with her lips blue from the cold, shivering as she enters the house, and most likely will barely manage to say a word. How about we turn back and not give her this chance to play the pitiful victim?"

Chen Ping'an sighed. "Let's go back."

Liu Zhimo chuckled. "You really are tougher than I imagined."

Chen Ping'an shook his head. "I already know everything. Why let her suffer more? Being resentful is the most pointless thing."

Liu Zhimo asked, "Should we return together like last time when we went to the Spring Courtyard?"

Chen Ping'an responded, "Not this time. I can’t keep bothering you, Liu Island Master; I can’t take advantage of Qingxia Island like that."

Liu Zhimo didn’t insist, fading away with a playful grin. "Don’t worry; I won’t eavesdrop on your conversation. I can guess what she’ll say anyway."

When Chen Ping'an returned to his house, he found the woman shivering like a quail, arms wrapped around her shoulders. When she spotted Chen Ping'an from a distance, she hesitated for a moment but then quickly let go.

As a woman, she could see Chen Ping'an from far away.

Of course, Chen Ping'an had seen her long before.

Indeed.

As Chen Ping'an approached the mountain gate, he quickened his steps, handing her the charcoal stove first as he opened the door. "Aunt, what brings you here? You could have sent word, and I would have come to the Spring Courtyard."

The woman entered the house, sitting at the table with her hands resting on the charcoal stove, forcing a smile as she said, "Ping'an, the little mudfish has died. Aunt doesn’t dare to say much, but after all these years, the little mudfish has been with us, and without it... well, not only at the Spring Courtyard but even here on Qingxia Island, we probably wouldn’t have lived. So could you return the little mudfish's body to us so we can bury it somewhere? If this request is too much, Aunt wouldn’t say anything or hold it against you. Just like Gu Can has been saying all these years, besides me, the mother, you are the only one who truly cares about him. All those years in Mud Bottle Alley, it was just a bowl of rice. You’ve done so much for us, both big and small, things we’ve seen and things we haven’t seen—you’ve done them all..."

As she spoke, the woman covered her face and wept, sobbing, "Ending up like this is all fate; Aunt truly doesn’t blame you, really..."

Chen Ping'an listened patiently until the woman was too choked up to speak further.

He quietly moved the large stove from underneath the desk, opened the bag in the corner containing charcoal, and refilled the stove with charcoal. After lighting the coals with a special fire starter, he squatted down to push it under the table so the woman could warm her feet by the stove.

After doing all this, Chen Ping'an sat on the long bench, remaining silent.

The woman quickly wiped her tears, gently lifting her feet to rest them on the edge of the stove, her expression tragic. "If it can’t be done, that’s fine too. The little mudfish came from the water and doesn’t need to be buried like we do, with such fuss over a life lost."

Chen Ping'an’s gaze turned distant.

He vaguely recalled a moment from years ago in a small alley, protecting her as they argued with those long-tongued women and after the fight. They sat on the steps of the courtyard door, and she silently wept, clutching the patched hem of her clothes, not saying a word. When she saw her unruly son swaggering into Mud Bottle Alley, she quickly turned her back, wiped her tears, and straightened her clothes, using her fingers to comb her hair back.

Even now, Chen Ping'an still felt that the aunt from those years was the best mother Gu Can could have.

She softly asked, "Ping'an, I heard you went to Gongliu Island this time and met Liu Laozu. Was it dangerous?"

Chen Ping'an clenched his fists, gently placing them on his knees.

He felt no extreme sorrow now, just helplessness.

Those who perceive deep waters are often met with misfortune.

Taking a deep breath, Chen Ping'an relaxed his clenched fists and extended a finger to point at his own eyes. "Aunt, we’re truly family. We don’t even need to say anything; it’s all right here. When you opened the courtyard door and brought me a bowl of rice, I saw it. After that fight, when you sat at the courtyard door and gestured to me to keep it a secret from Gu Can, so he wouldn’t worry about you, I saw that too."

The woman hesitated to speak.

Under the table, she tightly gripped the bamboo handle of the small charcoal stove.

Chen Ping'an longed to tell her.

"Aunt, perhaps you don’t know, back in Mud Bottle Alley, I realized that for that little mudfish, you hoped for my demise. You wanted Liu Zhimo to harm me."

"Aunt, you might not know that night when you invited Liu Zhimo to the Spring Courtyard to inquire about my background, he didn’t even drink that bowl of tea; he took the water from the cup instead. He actually used the secret method of Echoing Water from the mountain to collect the tea water, then placed it in the bowl on this table. It was just that I shattered the echoes of your conversation."

"Aunt, you also don’t know that when you removed the fox fur, and the maids returned, even that little gesture at the door, when you saw me and immediately let go, all those hidden motives, as well as everything you said upon entering, I am fully aware of it all, crystal clear."

But these words, Chen Ping'an swallowed back one by one, and in the end, he only said, "Aunt, the future Bookletter Lake may not be the same as it is now. You and Gu Can won’t have to be so afraid anymore. If one day the family business can’t be maintained, or if assassins come seeking revenge, Gu Can won’t need to kill again and again. But until that day truly arrives, I hope you can stay at the Spring Courtyard as much as possible."

The woman gently nodded.

Chen Ping'an looked at her and said slowly, "Bookletter Lake will change significantly, and when that day truly comes, I hope you can be cautious, just like moving from Mud Bottle Alley to Qingxia Island. Try to see how to help Gu Can expand the family business of the Spring Courtyard. Since it’s for Gu Can's benefit, then I believe the hardships endured in Mud Bottle Alley for so many years, and the three years since arriving at Qingxia Island, were all worth it. In the future, for Gu Can, can you endure a bit longer? There will surely come a day when we can break through, just like you raised Gu Can, ensuring he had food and clothes that were never inferior to the kids from other neighborhoods. Just like how Mud Bottle Alley turned into the Spring Courtyard, perhaps one day it will be an entire island of our own, rather than just a bigger Hongbo Mansion, right? What’s more, Gu Can’s father might come to Bookletter Lake to see you someday."

The woman vigorously nodded, her eyes moist and slightly swollen.

Chen Ping'an ceased speaking.

After a while, the woman said her goodbyes, and Chen Ping'an walked her to the door. The woman steadfastly refused to take the charcoal stove, saying it was unnecessary. A bit of wind chill was nothing; she had endured far worse in Mud Bottle Alley and had long since gotten used to it.

After watching her leave, Chen Ping'an returned to his house.

The woman walked away, struggling yet without complaints.

As she approached the Spring Courtyard, her demeanor immediately shifted. She straightened her face, her lips moving slightly, but when the maids rushed out, she quickly smiled again.

Chen Ping'an sat at the table, lost in thought, muttering to himself, "It’s useless, isn’t it, Chen Ping'an?"

He rubbed his cheeks and thought, "Then I should do something useful."

Chen Ping'an bent down, shifted the stove, stood on it, still holding the charcoal stove and rested his head on the table, dozing off.

Half-asleep, he felt as if he had returned to his hometown.

In the middle of the night, the barking of a dog and the cries of restless children disturbed his dreams, along with the sound of an old woman’s frail figure washing clothes.

Many would find it annoying.

Chen Ping'an had to endure it back in Mud Bottle Alley as well.

After all, it was all trivial.

And the more he thought about it, the more trivial it seemed. Looking back now, he even felt a sense of nostalgia.

With a loud clatter, the charcoal stove fell to the floor, waking Chen Ping'an. He picked it up and placed it aside on the long bench.

He went to sleep again.

When he awoke, it was already deep into the night, roused by a knock at the door.

Chen Ping'an opened the door, nearly unable to hold back a curse.

It turned out to be Liu Chongrun, the island master of Zhu Chai Island.

Chen Ping'an opened the door, but did not step aside.

Liu Chongrun raised an eyebrow. "What, you won’t let me in?"

Chen Ping'an countered, "If I let you in, how am I supposed to visit Hongbo Mansion to see Ma Yuan's arrival in the future?"

Liu Chongrun waved the porcelain bottle in his hand. "Such an important matter, and we’re discussing it at the door?"

Chen Ping'an frowned. "Are you doing this on purpose?"

Liu Chongrun smiled slyly and nodded.

Chen Ping'an sighed. "Liu Island Master, what are you thinking? This isn’t how business is done, you know?"

Liu Chongrun retorted, "Don’t reason with a woman."

Chen Ping'an was taken aback, then smiled wryly. "That makes sense."

Stepping aside, Liu Chongrun entered the house. Chen Ping'an hesitated to close the door, only to have Liu Chongrun kick it shut behind him.

Liu Chongrun looked down at the large stone slab, then glanced at the wooden chest in the corner and the split bamboo leaning against the wall. Finally, his gaze returned to the stone slab. "So, Chen Ping'an, you’re hiding away here just to mess with these creepy things?"

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Liu Chongrun approached the table and glanced down at the stove. "This thing is quite rare."

Chen Ping'an chuckled. "The common folk find your wealthy household's dragon heating even more astonishing."

As a Golden Core Earth Immortal deliberately hiding his talents in Bookletter Lake, Liu Chongrun settled down, placing his feet beside the stove. "Oh, this is warm enough! I should get one for Baoguang Pavilion too."

Chen Ping'an asked, "Have you thought this through, Liu Island Master?"

Liu Chongrun remained curious, glancing around, and casually said, "I have thought it through. Who would dare be careless with an accountant that Liu Laozu personally escorts? That would be asking for death, right?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "We may need to temporarily set our business aside."

Liu Chongrun angrily exclaimed, "Chen Ping'an, are you messing with me? Who was it that went to Baoguang Pavilion to initiate a deal? Now that I’ve come to give you a personal response, you start acting aloof? What, now that you’re close to Liu Laozu, you want to raise the price? Go ahead, name your price! I want to see if you have the gall to say those words of wanting both wealth and talent."

Chen Ping'an stared at this fallen royal princess. "If it weren't for the many island masters who have visited Qingxia Island before you tonight, you wouldn’t be sitting here cursing me but truly drawing a line with me. Are you genuinely unaware, or are you pretending not to know? You could have waited patiently on Zhu Chai Island; your meddling will only endanger Zhu Chai Island. If I fail, then not only will Zhu Chai Island be forced out of Bookletter Lake, but you won’t even be able to keep your current business intact! Liu Chongrun, I’ll ask you one more time, what exactly are you thinking?"

Liu Chongrun laughed. "My country has fallen, my family has perished, and I’ve endured it all. Now that there’s no chance of my country falling again, the worst I face is just losing my family. What’s there to fear?"

Chen Ping'an's mind suddenly stirred, and he turned his gaze toward the door.

Liu Chongrun was slightly surprised. Did Chen Ping'an truly possess the sharp senses attributed to the Golden Core Sword Cultivators? Otherwise, why would he have such a keen perception?

Because outside, an uninvited guest had sneaked in, like the kind of man who often eavesdrops on others from behind walls.

Chen Ping'an winked at Liu Chongrun and then coldly said, "Liu Island Master, I’ll state it once again—I will not accept Zhu Chai Island’s female cultivator as a personal maid! This isn’t about the matter of divine money..."

However, Liu Chongrun didn’t respond; instead, he lamented, "I didn’t expect you, Chen Ping'an, to be such a heartless man! I misjudged you!"

Liu Chongrun suddenly stood up, flung open the door, and darted away.

Chen Ping'an stood there, dumbfounded.

With a heavy heart, he stood up and walked to the door. Moments later, Ma Yuan from Hongbo Mansion approached with a beaming smile.

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to explain, Ma Yuan exclaimed joyfully and patted Chen Ping'an’s shoulder. "No need to explain! I know, the Crown Princess is just trying to provoke me, wanting me to feel jealous. Chen Ping'an, I owe you this favor! In the future, when I become Dao companions with the Crown Princess, you will be the greatest contributor!"

Ma Yuan left, chuckling and rubbing his fists in excitement.

Chen Ping'an stood there, muttering to himself, "Is that even possible?"

He shook his head in disbelief.

Walking to the ferry terminal, he squatted down, formed a snowball, thought for a moment, and decided to build a snowman, inserting a few pieces of charcoal for its eyes and nose, then clapped his hands.

After some thought, he built another snowman beside it, slightly "slender" in appearance.

Finally satisfied, he pondered about love and relationships, realizing he truly didn’t understand the "reason" behind them. He could only act on his thoughts and desires, even during those two distant travels, one of which involved three hundred years in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, leaving him even more perplexed. Especially with the likes of Zhou Fei, now Jiang Shangzhen of Yu Gui Sect, who made him wonder why so many outstanding women in the Spring Tide Palace devoted themselves so deeply to a man who was almost excessively sentimental.

Now, however, he understood a little better.

It was like understanding one principle opened the door to countless others.

People around him who did not adhere to reason, and had the power to bully outsiders, made him feel particularly at ease.

In marketplaces, in courts, among mountains and valleys, throughout history, there would always be many such people.

In the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, Zhou Fei, notorious in the martial world, was one reason why so many women devoted themselves to him.

People harbor both disdain and admiration for the strong.

This is one of the fundamentals of human nature.

It’s not that all women in the world are like this, but particularly those who are in the Spring Tide Palace, deep down, there seems to be an echo resonating within them, a voice that continuously reverberates outside their hearts. That sound's allure is like the most devout monk reciting scriptures, like the most diligent scholar studying.

That voice keeps telling them that by giving their all, their entirety to Zhou Fei, Zhou Fei could indeed gain more from elsewhere.

In truth, in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, where the martial arts bottleneck isn’t high, the reality is just as they say. Even if the Spring Tide Palace is moved to Tongye Continent, and Zhou Fei becomes Jiang Shangzhen, it still holds true.

Unless Jiang Shangzhen provokes someone like Du Mao or others.

Just like Gu Can’s actions can fully convince himself, and even those around him.

Gu Can’s reasoning is seamless on his end, so even Chen Ping'an, someone who cares deeply for Gu Can, couldn’t convince him until Gu Can encountered Liu Laocheng on Gongliu Island.

You might prefer to be unreasonable; perhaps within certain rules, you can live quite freely, but the path is long, and one day, no matter how strong your fists are, there will always be someone stronger than you who can easily destroy you.

Chen Ping'an's encounter with Du Mao was a coincidence and a necessity.

Gu Can's encounter with Liu Laocheng, however, was solely a necessity. That time, Liu Laocheng appeared early, early enough that even Chen Ping'an felt caught off guard.

However, regardless of who it was, as Liu Laocheng said on the ferry, one never knows whether one’s fate with others is a blessing or a curse.

If Gu Can's meeting with Liu Laocheng was inevitable, then Chen Ping'an’s arrival at Bookletter Lake, embroiled in a deadlock and asking for trouble, was it not also inevitable?

It was the same.

In the future, there will still be an array of inevitabilities quietly waiting for Chen Ping'an to face—some good, some bad.

This is what Daoism refers to as fortune and misfortune having no doors; only people summon them themselves.

It’s just that the complex matter of being reasonable is something Chen Ping'an only recently understood; it was that day in the middle of the lake, after knocking on bowls and chopsticks, and feeling the cool breeze that he finally figured it out.

That is, the most interesting aspect of the vast world is that the strongest people are the most holy and the most reverent, precisely the ones who excel at reasoning.

In that moment, even if Chen Ping'an had great disappointment towards human nature after arriving at Bookletter Lake, and then some small flickers of hope afterward, regardless of all that, at that instant, he suddenly found himself somewhat fond of this world.

He envisioned that one day, after having visited Beiju Luzhou, traversed the Upside-Down Mountain and the Sword Qi Great Wall, he would definitely go to the Central Divine Continent, and meet the Sage of Literature to discuss his experiences and joys since their parting. Next time, he must accompany the old gentleman for a good drink, ensuring he wouldn’t feel lonely or indulge in drinking alone anymore.

He even wanted to muster the courage to ask the old gentleman if he could meet those two even older sages, of course, he could wait until they were free.

The thought of this seemingly bold and rude intention brought a smile to the young accountant's face.

Does it matter how good or bad the world is? It matters a lot.

But does it matter that much? Perhaps not necessarily.

In the night, Chen Ping'an squatted down, looking at the two snowmen side by side, his grin bright as he made a face at them. "Right? Chen Ping'an, and Miss Ning. Hey? You two should talk; don’t just focus on each other, I know you both like each other..."

---

As the year drew to a close, nearing New Year's Eve, the accountant of Qingxia Island, along with a tall youth named Zeng Ye, embarked on his third journey.

This time, they directly left the borders of Bookletter Lake, crossed the southern border of Shihau Kingdom, and headed northward.

That day, they spent the night at Lingguan Temple.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 490: The Great Trends of the World

As winter approached, the chill in the air became particularly biting. 

The roads along the official routes were muddy, while the secluded paths were buried under deep snow, crunching underfoot with every step. According to the estimations of several earth immortals from the Book of Scrolls Lake, a more formidable snowfall was expected by the end of the year. This snowstorm would not only blanket Book of Scrolls Lake but also other vassals of the Vermilion Glory Dynasty, including the Stone Calligraphy Kingdom. The cultivators of Book of Scrolls Lake welcomed this news, while the vassal states would likely face some hardship. It was uncertain whether the three heavy snowfalls after winter would inadvertently slow the advance of the Great Li cavalry southward, giving the Vermilion Glory Dynasty its first chance to catch its breath since its establishment, adopting a strategy of fortifications and scorched earth.

However, these grand trends of the world seemed to have little impact on the daily lives of the cultivators perched atop the mountains, as "the world" was often divided between those above and below.

Inside the main hall of the Spirit Official Temple, Zeng Ye had gathered twigs from the surroundings and lit a bonfire.

Chen Ping'an still wore a thick cotton robe, much like he did on Qingxia Island. The only difference was that he no longer carried a sword. Instead, he had hung a self-made bamboo sword and a replica yellow sword he had purchased from the Monkey's Cry Street in Chishui City at his waist.

As the two munched on their rations, this journey marked Zeng Ye's first long trip. Compared to the quiet Chen Ping'an, the youthful Zeng Ye couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement. Passing through a checkpoint and presenting the genealogy issued by the Patriarch Hall of Qingxia Island to the soldiers at the Stone Calligraphy Kingdom's border felt exhilarating for him. Yet, he dared not show too much enthusiasm; he could sense the weight of worry on Mr. Chen's mind, and Zeng Ye was not blind to the subtleties of human sentiment.

The two spoke little.

After finishing his rations, Chen Ping'an unfurled a map of the Stone Calligraphy Kingdom's administrative divisions. The situation in the southern territories of the Stone Calligraphy Kingdom appeared relatively stable, with only a few scattered scouts from the Great Li cavalry patrolling. Chen Ping'an and Zeng Ye had encountered them twice, but even in the untouched southern regions, signs of chaos were already emerging, as exemplified by the Spirit Official Temple where they currently found themselves.

This was an old, dilapidated temple that had not been maintained in years. According to the nearby villagers, the old priest who managed the incense offerings had died in the autumn. The county office was supposed to appoint a new priest, and generally, as long as the candidate had a clean background and could obtain a signature from a qualified Daoist priest, the state would approve it without needing to trouble the capital. However, with the arrival of the Great Li barbarians, the situation had become chaotic, and such trivial matters were overlooked. After all, the common people were fleeing, and when they returned home, the court would not blame them. But the position of the temple priest, akin to that of the county magistrate, bore the responsibility of "guarding the land," so the two candidates the county office had in mind were reluctant to take on the role, even after the county office had made significant concessions. It was likely that by the time the Great Li barbarians had surrounded the capital of the Stone Calligraphy Kingdom and turned their sights southward, this already sparsely populated Spirit Official Temple would lose all its incense offerings for the coming year.

In chaotic times, the common people had little time to worry about paying respect to deities in temples; their priority was merely to fill their own stomachs. 

Chen Ping'an handed a bamboo box to Zeng Ye, who carried it on his back. Inside was the ghostly treasure known as "Entering the Underworld" from the secret vaults of Qingxia Island. 

As for Yu Huai, who had visited Qingxia Island and actively sold a superior spirit tool that resembled the Glazed Pavilion to Chen Ping'an, it was temporarily stored among his belongings. The twelve rooms capable of nurturing ghost generals were currently occupied by relatively complete and full souls. Except for one room, the other eleven spirits had been Qi practitioners who perished at the hands of charcoal and snow, their resentment heavy and their obsessions deep.

Although Zeng Ye had average talent in cultivation and a somewhat dull temperament, he was a tall youth who was diligent and eager to help. Since leaving the Book of Scrolls Lake, Zeng Ye had been busy throughout their journey northward.

However, Chen Ping'an was not one to indulge in a life of luxury; he did not require Zeng Ye to serve him. Thus, the two traveled harmoniously, like teacher and disciple without the formal title. This journey into the Stone Calligraphy Kingdom required visiting more than forty locations, covering eight provinces and over twenty counties. Zeng Ye was particularly troubled by the fact that half of these places were in the north of the Stone Calligraphy Kingdom, where chaos reigned and they might have to interact with the Great Li barbarians. Yet, just the thought that Mr. Chen was a celestial being eased Zeng Ye's worries a bit. Growing up in poverty and being brought to the Book of Scrolls Lake, Zeng Ye had never traveled with elders from his sect; he had no experience of the "celestial teachers" of the mountains and still harbored a natural fear of the court and its military.

This might seem naive, but to Chen Ping'an, it was the correct mindset. Otherwise, if they encountered unfamiliar cavalry from the far north, mistaking them for the ordinary soldiers of the central region of Baoping Continent, any conflict could lead to disaster. Not only Zeng Ye, a mere Fifth Realm cultivator, but even a Golden Core earth immortal would be at a disadvantage against the Great Li cavalry, with death as a likely outcome.

Regarding this matter, Chen Ping'an did not deliberately remind Zeng Ye. Many seemingly superficial truths must be experienced personally to be understood deeply, at least to be heard and seen firsthand.

Zeng Ye began his cultivation using the secret techniques taught by Chen Ping'an, practicing his breathing and energy control. The more humble his background as a wild cultivator, the more he appreciated this hard-won opportunity.

Chen Ping'an found it challenging to cultivate his mind now and had stagnated in his physical strength, martial arts, and spiritual energy absorption. 

Rising from his seat, Chen Ping'an stepped over the threshold and stood outside the Spirit Official Temple, furrowing his brow slightly.

There was a widely known old saying in the countryside: "One person does not dwell in the temple, two do not look at the well."

The common people might not truly understand its profundity, but cultivators felt it more deeply.

When a person's inner heart is filled with good intentions, it is like a tree that stands firm, but when mixed with distractions and evil thoughts, they rush in like a flood. The same applies to temples and other places that once thrived on incense offerings; without them, the spiritual energy dissipates, making them more susceptible to the attention and intrusion of malevolent spirits.

Many scholarly writings have recorded strange happenings in broken temples, illustrating this principle.

Once, between the Colorful Garment Kingdom and the Combing Water Kingdom, Chen Ping'an had encountered a fox spirit in a dilapidated temple.

That time, there had been both a meeting and a parting.

Lowering his head, Chen Ping'an cupped his hands together and gently exhaled a puff of mist, rubbing his palms together for warmth. After a moment's thought, he closed the door to avoid disturbing Zeng Ye's cultivation.

Zeng Ye was pure-hearted, but he lacked the resilience needed for the path of cultivation and could easily become distracted. Therefore, tonight's effort to refine spiritual energy and nurture his Qi had only just begun when it would be interrupted. If this happened once or twice, it wouldn't matter, but if it became a habit, he would unwittingly form a pattern that could lead to significant problems. Human laziness, greed, and other tendencies often manifest in ways that seem innocuous but are easily noticed by outsiders.

Thus, in the early stages of Zeng Ye's cultivation, Chen Ping'an needed to be more mindful and attentive to the youth.

Though he wasn't a formal master, he resembled a protector.

At this thought, Chen Ping'an couldn't help but chuckle.

He was not feeling heavy-hearted; instead, he felt lighter, perhaps recalling some happy memories from the past. Unbeknownst to him, his brow relaxed, and he smiled, saying, "Come out; I know you're here. Although the Spirit Official Hall has lost its incense offerings, causing one of its manifestations to remain hidden and asleep for many years, the little remaining divine essence of the Spirit Official is not enough to allow it to appear and protect the area's fate. However, you have no enmity with each other; it's better to coexist peacefully than to form inexplicable grudges, right? If you were to encounter a temperamental Spirit Official, they might expend their divine essence and shatter their golden body just to eliminate you. You may freely partake of any remaining incense offerings outside the main hall; I believe the Spirit Official will not grow angry. The distinction between yin and yang means that while ordinary people tend to favor the light, the spirits may not share that aversion to the dark. Your existence beyond death is a matter of destiny and opportunity, so you can wander around the main hall to maintain a bit of spiritual light, but please do not enter the main hall itself."

Chen Ping'an spoke patiently and carefully, for many resentful spirits laden with grief or attachments were often muddled and had less understanding of the world than those who lived. They might even be worse off than a Fifth Realm cultivator like Zeng Ye.

To Chen Ping'an's eyes, he sensed several malevolent spirits lurking near the front and back doors, where the cold winds blew but did not feel oppressive. It was the height of winter, and the warmth emanating from the ordinary people, such as young men, might not allow them to perceive the sinister aura exuded by these spirits. However, for those with weak yang energy who were prone to misfortune, they could very well fall prey to illness brought on by the cold.

The rural remedies for restoring energy might not be effective, as they treat the symptoms but not the root cause. In contrast, the techniques of some shamans might prove to be surprisingly useful.

Uncertain if they were wary of Chen Ping'an or if he had made them understand, the spirits gradually retreated, abandoning their intent to enter the Spirit Official Temple’s main hall.

Since they halted their advance, Chen Ping'an felt no need to say or do anything further.

The first place they needed to go was a small mountain sect in the Stone Calligraphy Kingdom, where a female spirit resided. Chen Ping'an often sought her opinions and could allow her to inhabit Zeng Ye’s body. However, if she felt uncomfortable, she could temporarily take refuge in a fox spirit talisman made from the fur of the Xu clan from Qingfeng City, which allowed a beautiful talisman woman to appear by day and return to the talisman by night. They could accompany Chen Ping'an and Zeng Ye on their travels.

Twelve fox spirit talismans served as lodgings, and many spirits had once been residents of the Stone Calligraphy Kingdom. Thus, when night fell and no one was around, Chen Ping'an would take out the talismans and allow them to manifest. However, he needed to expend some snowflake money; otherwise, the talismans would close, preventing the spirits from returning to the mortal realm and seeing the beautiful winter scenery that was untouched by their ghostly essence.

On regular nights, the atmosphere around Chen Ping'an and Zeng Ye would be lively, filled with chatter and warmth. Even the spirits that were typically shy would have formed bonds with one or two others, sharing secrets and laughter, steering clear of discussions about the Dao or cultivation—such topics were best left untouched to avoid unnecessary heartache.

As for why the spirits had not manifested tonight, it was because Chen Ping'an had asked them to return to their talismans, as they were staying overnight at the Spirit Official Temple, respecting local customs and avoiding any offense to this shrine. Some bolder female spirits had teased and complained about Chen Ping'an, questioning why he, as a divine being of Qingxia Island, should bother with such trivialities. After all, what could a small shrine's deity do if provoked? But Chen Ping'an insisted, and they could only obediently return to the meticulously crafted fox fur talismans.

At this moment, Chen Ping'an stood in the corridor, with the main hall behind him housing a red-faced, bearded deity in a golden robe and armor, holding an iron whip, striking a formidable pose.

It is said that he is one of over two hundred officially recorded Daoist deities.

There was also a highly obscure rumor that had spread in the realm of the righteous over the past century, primarily heard by Fifth Realm masters and earth immortals like Liu Zhimo.

This rumor stated that one of the three Daoist masters who had previously presided over Baiyu Capital, known for his unmatched beauty, had proposed that among the five hundred Daoist deities, all beings in the world, even the Tianshi of Longhu Mountain and those who were not originally Daoist disciples from other teachings or philosophical schools, would have a chance to accumulate enough merit to be reinstated and eventually serve in one of the five city temples of Baiyu Capital, enjoying limitless incense offerings.

Thus, aside from the two hundred deities already "ranked among the immortals," it implied that half of the divine positions remained unfilled, awaiting the destined.

Descending the stairs, Chen Ping'an fashioned a snowball, compacting it gently in his hands. He did not head toward the main hall but instead wandered between the two halls.

This was likely an example of "the well water not intruding upon the river."

Chen Ping'an pondered some matters.

Nanfangzhou, Tongyezhou, and Fuyouzhou—the three regions closest to the Upside-Down Mountain—were all in turmoil, vying for treasures that had emerged. Du Mao's failed ascension resulted in his beautiful glazed body shattering, a colossal opportunity that had sparked contention among many Fifth Realm cultivators from Baoping Continent.

And then there was the talk of five hundred divine positions.

This was the true essence of the trends of the world.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 491: Heaven and Earth Are Unselfish, Humanity Has Its Way

Chen Ping'an had personally experienced the turmoil in Tongye Continent and was caught in the crossfire to some extent. Fortunately, his life was not in danger, but he had been severely tricked by that young Taoist from Taiping Mountain who handed him a jade token from the Patriarch Hall.

Zhong Kui had even fallen into the realm of ghosts because of this, losing his status as a gentleman of the academy.

On the path of the Great Dao, peril lies within peril, and the profound nature of it is that risks and opportunities coexist. It is akin to fishing in troubled waters—gaining profits, or even becoming wealthy overnight surpassing a hundred years of accumulation. Conversely, one may find themselves crippled by the Great Dao, unable to rise again. Ultimately, it all hinges on the individual’s cultivation and skills. In the grand scheme of things, Zhong Kui from Taiping Mountain is one such example, while Du Mao from Tongye Sect is another; the distinction between good and evil does not exist.

Knowing these matters might not be particularly useful, but understanding the context is certainly better than being entirely in the dark.

Since this journey would take him through various states and counties in the Kingdom of Shihou, Chen Ping'an had garnered much knowledge about its court, rivers, lakes, and local customs while on Qingxia Island.

The Kingdom of Shihou revered the Dao, honoring a wandering Daoist immortal as the national teacher. Such an immortal is, of course, someone not aligned with the four main Daoist schools, but rather from the peripheral sects. Among the three branches under the Dao Ancestor, there are differences in the style of their robes, but the Taoist crowns worn on their heads are the easiest to distinguish—namely the Hibiscus Crown, the Fish Tail Crown, and the Lotus Crown. The rank of a Taoist priest is reflected in these subtle distinctions. Additionally, the Longhu Mountain lineage from the Central Lands belongs to the native Daoist forces of Haoran World.

It was said that the national protector immortal had called upon winds and rain at the front lines to halt the advance of the Northern Barbarians and their Great Li Iron Cavalry, successfully safeguarding the capital—a remarkable achievement indeed.

Besides these reports from the Celestial Residence of Liuxu Island, Chen Ping'an had also hosted a banquet in Chishui City at a suitable moment, inviting Gu Can’s two brothers: the Shihou prince Han Jingling, who had been fleeing here for nearly a year, and Huang He, the son of a border general in the Kingdom of Shihou.

Chen Ping'an asked many questions but kept the conversation light and polite.

Although Han Jingling was a prince of Shihou, one of the legitimate sons of the current emperor, he had been away from the capital and his fief for many years. However, without a war being fought, he had found an excuse to leave his territory and swiftly fled south for safety. It was not hard to guess what kind of temperament he had. Yet, the unpredictability of life led to the Great Li Iron Cavalry’s southward march, which brought devastation and destruction to the stubborn northern regions of Shihou. In contrast, Han Jingling’s territory, being without a leader, somehow escaped calamity. There was no military disaster, and he inexplicably gained the reputation of being a “wise king.” However, Chen Ping'an knew that much of it was due to the strategies devised by the advisers surrounding Han Jingling.

When Han Jingling faced the well-known accountant from Qingxia Island, he naturally spoke freely, almost eager to lay bare his heart and soul before the esteemed Chen, who had made a name for himself at Shujian Lake several times. Huang He, the son of the Shihou general, had previously left Shujian Lake to join his father, who had sided with the Great Li Iron Cavalry, and they were planning to support Han Jingling as the new emperor of Shihou. It was said that he had already met with Su Gaoshan, hence his return to Shujian Lake and Chishui City was to bring good news to Han Jingling.

Chen Ping'an did not provide them with the opportunity to become brothers with him, and naturally, Han Jingling and Huang He did not have the courage to do so either. However, there were subtle differences in their dispositions. The former, being in distress, had a low spirit. As for what kind of scene would unfold once he succeeded in becoming the new emperor of Shihou, whether he would regret his earlier obsequiousness at the banquet in Chishui City, Han Jingling had yet to consider that step. Chen Ping'an, on the other hand, was indifferent. As for Huang He, before Chen Ping'an, he appeared even more humble than Han Jingling, yet concealed a flicker of tension beneath his courtesy—like a bowstring strained to its limit. After all, the imposing Su Gaoshan from the Great Li, this towering figure, had provided a significant source of reassurance for their Huang clan of border soldiers. The day they truly aligned themselves with this formidable mountain, not only would the once-difficult Gu Can not be a threat, but even Chen Ping'an would likely have to treat Huang He with respect in future encounters.

Chen Ping'an silently observed the subtle shifts in their hearts.

As for the news from the Liuxu Island residence, the Emperor of Shihou had issued a decree to inform the court and the people, specifically condemning the actions of Huang He’s father, who had once been granted the title of “Loyal and Brave Marquis” by the late emperor, with the eight words “Arrogant and Indulgent, Wielding Soldiers to Harm the People” serving as a final judgment.

Huang He, who had previously kept quiet while accompanying Chen Ping'an and Han Jingling during the banquet, mentioned this matter with a hint of pride, a broad smile on his face. He said that his father, upon hearing the decree, was not angry at all, merely stating, “Furious and exasperated.”

Chen Ping'an observed that youthful, spirited face and drank a cup of wine alone. When he raised his cup, Han Jingling quickly called for Huang He to join in a toast.

There was a sense of shared celebration in the air.

Chen Ping'an found it amusing.

Even at this kind of banquet, everything was filled with subtlety, and the best wine had no flavor at all.

After what seemed like a joyous banquet for both guests and hosts, Chen Ping'an returned alone to Qingxia Island. Regarding the Great Li martial general Su Gaoshan, he held him in even higher esteem this time; the last time was due to the miscalculations of Tan Yuanyi from Lizi Island.

Chen Ping'an regained his focus.

It turned out that a tall ghostly figure clad in armor had appeared in the front hall, likely a battlefield officer in life.

This ghost stepped out of the front hall, crossing the threshold with his left foot, and clasped his fists, saying, “Esteemed immortal, we inadvertently offended you earlier, nearly disturbing the spirit lord of the main hall. Thanks to your reminder, I’ve avoided much trouble.”

At this, the pale-faced officer ghost smiled sadly, withdrew his hands, and instinctively pressed down on the hilt of his long knife at his waist.

Both the armor and the sword were manifestations of the various obsessions he had in life.

Looking at the battle-scarred warrior from the Kingdom of Shihou, particularly the wounds on his chest and neck inflicted by sabers, Chen Ping'an, though he had never truly experienced the brutal clash of armies, understood that this individual had died heroically on the battlefield—truly deserving of the phrase “glorious death.”

The ghost glanced back at the front hall before continuing, “Immortal, you are from the mountains and may understand that we, the forsaken spirits of heaven and earth, have more intense desires for life after death than the living. As long as we can cling to existence, we will stop at nothing. After dying in battle, my fellow soldiers and I, the warriors of the same hometown, have lingered on, haunting the nights as we journeyed south. Some of my brothers could not hold on and scattered their souls along the way. Others returned home to see their wives and children, finding peace at the ancestral tombs. Yet, many brothers have become increasingly possessed; whenever they encounter the living at night, they wish to consume their vital energy or, disregarding everything, seek to feast on the souls in places like local spirit temples, now devoid of deities. This is difficult to restrain, becoming increasingly challenging…”

Chen Ping'an nodded and asked, “May I ask, General, what if among your comrades, some wish to act in such a way as to harm the innocent on the road, and there’s no way to stop them? How will you handle that?”

This was a rather bleak question.

The ghostly general gently pushed the blade in its sheath, his expression pained yet resolute, “That would depend on my blade’s response! In life, we were warriors who protected our homes and country. Since we died in battle, we have no avenue to serve our nation anymore. But if it means harming the innocent, they must first pass me.”

The general ghost took a deep breath and smiled, “I’m not afraid of the immortal laughing at me. As we journey south, one by one, my brothers gradually return home, we have diminished from over six hundred to less than ten. Not only have we not harmed any living citizens, but we have also purged nearly a hundred malevolent spirits and vengeful ghosts from the mass graves. Unfortunately, the cultivators who accompanied our army all fled quickly, leaving me unable to inquire after my death. I wonder if our actions of protecting the people can accumulate merit for our brothers, so they may be reborn well in their next lives.”

Chen Ping'an first returned a salute, then drew back his hands, solemnly stating, “Heaven and earth are unselfish, but humanity has its way. I believe you and your comrades will accumulate merit, protecting yourselves and benefiting your descendants!”

Upon hearing these earnest words from the immortal, a man of iron and bone like the battlefield warrior could not help but shed tears, turning away and saying, “Did you hear that? I didn’t deceive you!”

At the back door of the front hall, the other soldiers appeared, each clasping their fists, unsure whether to thank the warrior who had shared life and death with them or to express gratitude to the young man in the green cotton robe for his “final judgment.”

As the world lay in the cold of winter, when a nation’s mountains and rivers lay in ruins, the sound of their iron armor clanking echoed.

That night, under the heavy darkness, Chen Ping'an took out paper and brush, meticulously recording the names and origins of the more than six hundred ghosts, stating that in the future, friends would hold two grand ceremonies, both terrestrial and aquatic, and he could try to include their names. During this time, Zeng Ye, who had concluded his cultivation for the night, opened the main hall door and aided Chen Ping'an and the ten or so ghost soldiers greatly. Chen Ping'an was quite familiar with the elegant language of Baoping Continent, and while he wasn’t unfamiliar with the official language of the Zhu Ying Dynasty common among the cultivators and citizens around Shujian Lake, the various accents from Shihou became rather troublesome. Zeng Ye was just the right person to “bridge the gap.”

He worked diligently until before dawn, finally managing to record all the names.

For the spirits, the crowing of roosters didn’t necessarily mean retreat. Some strong-willed ghosts could roam the living world during the day, as long as it wasn’t the noon sun. However, the crowing of roosters marked the end of the night for the spirits, almost instinctively akin to the daybreak of the living.

The ghostly general from Shihou, after Chen Ping'an had put away his paper and brush, expressed a wish to take a walk outside the spirit temple before parting. Chen Ping'an, of course, would not refuse.

As they walked past the front hall and stepped outside, the general ghost chuckled softly, “Master Chen, you must be a ledger immortal from afar, otherwise our dialect wouldn’t sound so unfamiliar to you.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I’m from the north.”

The general instinctively rubbed his neck, laughing, “Even if you’re from the Great Li, it doesn’t matter. I can’t help but admit that the Great Li Iron Cavalry is truly… formidable. On the battlefield, there was no need for accompanying cultivators to join the fray. One side thought it unnecessary, while the other didn’t dare to risk their lives. In terms of combat, it was almost equal forces, yet the situation on the battlefield was completely one-sided. The Great Li troops fought from horseback, while we soldiers of Shihou were on foot. In terms of battlefield skills and momentum, our Shihou soldiers can’t compare. Losing in such a disgraceful manner is one thing; otherwise, my brothers and I wouldn’t have died so unwillingly. That said, I do have a measure of respect.”

Chen Ping'an hummed in acknowledgment.

The general paused, “I won’t ask too many questions, but I’m not foolish either. I know that Master Chen is the one organizing the terrestrial and aquatic ceremonies. So…”

The general lightly shook his armor, loosening his grip on the sword hilt, preparing to kneel on one knee to show his gratitude for this great favor to his brothers, to the mountain god. However, he was met with Chen Ping'an holding both of his hands, preventing him from kneeling.

Chen Ping'an smiled, “There’s no need for such formality. I can’t accept such great courtesy.”

The general had no choice but to give up and joked, “Master Chen, being this polite, do you want me to feel ashamed again?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Not at all.”

With both hands tucked in his sleeves, he gazed into the distance as dawn approached, the night gradually thinning. He softly said, “General Wei, you are actually much stronger than I am. From the very beginning, you knew how to do the right thing. This, in turn, is truly good for your comrades. I am not as decisive as you, General Wei. Not only do I burden myself, but I also cause everyone else to suffer.”

The general remained silent for a moment before asking, “Why is it that you don’t mention your own suffering? If you’re not happy, shouldn’t you be allowed to express it? And where does this ‘causing others to suffer’ come from? Master Chen, though I am an outsider, I’ve walked this path with you, sharing the hardships. It hasn’t been easy, especially when it comes to drawing blades against one’s own comrades. That pain is far worse than receiving a blow from the Great Li Iron Cavalry. When I felt I couldn’t endure it anymore, I would secretly gather a few of my trusted brothers and give them a beating, or I would have gone mad long ago. I’d probably have become a vengeful spirit before my brothers even lost their wits.”

Chen Ping'an pondered carefully, then broke into a smile, “Thank you, General Wei. Hearing this from you eases my heart.”

The general laughed heartily, “I’m not a general; I’m just a lowly sixth-rank officer. In truth, I’m still a merit official, but all the real military commanders have run off or avoided battle. That’s why I ended up leading so many brothers…”

As he spoke, he lightly stamped his foot in the accumulated snow by the roadside, “It’s merely going to my death, not something grand—just a burden on my heart.”

Chen Ping'an recalled something and took out a handful of snowflower coins, “These are divine coins from the mountains. You can use them to absorb spiritual energy and maintain your wits. They are the least valuable kind.”

The general hesitated for a moment, but still reached out to take them, joking, “Master Chen, you can give me more. I don’t mind if the divine coins are heavy; I love money in life and in death. The least burdensome item in this world is, after all, silver.”

Chen Ping'an quickly waved his hands and laughed, “I’m just an accountant now, doing business, very shrewd. I know your origins well. I’ll give you just the right amount of divine coins for your nighttime travels. It will be clear-cut.”

The general laughed heartily.

Well then.

Is there anyone in this world who is afraid others don’t know how “shrewd” they are in business?

Chen Ping'an asked, “General Wei, since your origin is from a garrison in the northern border of Shihou, do you plan to send your brothers off and return north alone?”

In truth, the general, who was just over thirty, shook his head, “No need to go back. My parents passed away early, and I have no wife or children. All the people I knew back home are gone. The emperor began large-scale troop movements in the border army two years ago. Aside from the northern border troops, which were originally tough, most of the capable and brave troops have been reassigned to the north. As for the southern factions like the Huang clan, they only shout but can’t mobilize; they’ve rebelled. It’s like a dagger driven deep into our backs. I know very well that the spirit of our Shihou has been completely crushed by the Great Li Iron Cavalry.”

Chen Ping'an slowly said, “If General Wei is willing, after you finish all your matters, you can head to Shujian Lake’s Yunlou City alone and look for a sword cultivator named Du Shehu of the Eighth Realm. If Du Shehu is not in the city, then go find the Liu family of Meizi Alley and ask their head to introduce you. He will take you by boat to Qingxia Island. Whether it’s Du Shehu or the Liu family head, just say you are a friend of Chen Ping'an, and once you arrive at Qingxia Island, someone will be there to receive you. You can stay temporarily at Zeng Ye’s place at the mountain gate until we return. If General Wei is willing, I can write a letter and give you a token.”

The general laughed and asked, “Could it be that Master Chen or your friends are well-versed in the ways of ghosts? Planning to cultivate me into a ghost general? Master Chen has done me a great favor, which is why I’m asking this. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have brought it up. At worst, I’ll just agree verbally and then wander around, deliberately avoiding Shujian Lake. I hope Master Chen can understand. To be honest, I have no interest in fighting and killing anymore. If I could, I’d rather wait day by day until my soul dissipates. I can only hope to repay Master Chen’s kindness in my next life.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “While I do know some ghostly secrets and possess a couple of spirit treasures suitable for ghostly beings, I don’t wish for General Wei to be used by me. I simply don’t want you to dissipate like this in the world. Once you reach Qingxia Island, your future path will be up to you, as long as you trust me. Even if General Wei desires to become a ghost general, I will not agree. That would be an insult to you and to myself.”

The ghostly general clasped his fists, saying, “Hearing this, I can rest easy. Living one more day means gaining one more day. As for how many divine coins I’ve consumed from Master Chen during this time, I’ll say this shamelessly: I’ll repay you in the next life! If there’s no opportunity, then let’s consider it that Master Chen’s skills as an accountant are not quite shrewd enough!”

Chen Ping'an removed the Sword-Feeding Gourd and took a sip of wine.

It was rare for him to drink just for the sake of drinking.

Upon returning to the spirit temple, Chen Ping'an wrote a letter, handing it along with a Yang Qi Lantern Talisman and a small booklet crafted from purple bamboo to the Wei general. Finally, he secretly slipped him a small summer coin.

After completing these tasks, dawn had arrived.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 492: The Heart of a Youth, Clear as Crystal

All the spectral entities temporarily took refuge in the front hall of the Spirit Officer Temple.

Chen Ping'an returned to the main hall, where Zeng Ye had already packed his belongings and secured the bamboo box on his back. 

Chen Ping'an clasped his fists before the brightly painted deity statue and softly apologized, “Tonight, we’ll be staying here, and we’ll also have the company of those spectral soldiers in the front hall. I hope it won't be too much trouble.”

Zeng Ye could only follow suit and offer his apologies as well.

As they exited the main hall, the marshal surnamed Wei merely saluted them with folded fists, offering no further words of gratitude.

After leaving the Spirit Officer Temple, the two continued their journey northward, treading through the snow. Zeng Ye quietly asked, “Mr. Chen, may I ask you a question?”

Chen Ping'an bent down to scoop up a handful of snow, casually washing his face before smiling, “Go ahead.”

Zeng Ye inquired, “Why do you keep spending so much for no apparent reason? On Maoyue Island, my master and everyone else mentioned that us cultivators burn through silver like it’s nothing. If we can’t even conserve our resources on small matters, we’re doomed to have no great prospects in this life.”

Chen Ping'an smiled and countered, “So, do you think I have great prospects right now?”

Zeng Ye scratched his head, “Of course! You’re already a top-notch cultivator in my eyes!”

Chen Ping'an replied, “Then it’s settled; since I’m already considered a great cultivator in your view, a little extravagance every now and then isn’t a big deal.”

Zeng Ye felt that Mr. Chen, who usually treated others sincerely, was intentionally being vague on this matter. However, seeing that Chen Ping'an was reluctant to elaborate, Zeng Ye didn’t press further.

Chen Ping'an sighed, “Last night, when we stayed at the Spirit Officer Temple, do you know the origins of the Spirit Officer and the responsibilities of these deities?”

Zeng Ye shook his head. “I only heard my master say they’re Taoist deities, even older than the mountain and water deities.”

Chen Ping'an smiled and said, “Then you must have heard the old saying, ‘Above three feet, there are deities,’ right? The Spirit Officer was once one of the gods who monitored the merits and misdeeds of people in the world. Although this saying isn’t very effective nowadays, I believe it’s much better to believe in it than not. Whether it’s the common people or us so-called cultivators, if we’re fearless of heaven and earth but only afraid of wicked people and evil spirits, that’s not good, in my opinion. But that’s just my view, Zeng Ye; you don’t have to take it too seriously. Just consider it a tidbit of knowledge.”

Zeng Ye nodded, “I’ll remember that. It might come in handy one day.”

Chen Ping'an glanced at Zeng Ye and chuckled.

Zeng Ye, feeling a bit shy, asked, “Did I say something wrong again, Mr. Chen?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head and continued walking slowly, “Not at all; you expressed yourself well. Some principles are meant for survival and to help oneself live better, while others are meant to soothe the mind. As for which principles are better or more suitable for the moment, it depends on each person’s background and mindset. I believe all of them are useful in their own way. You’ll come to learn various insights over time, and when faced with situations, just take them out, think them through, and then make your choices.”

Zeng Ye sincerely said, “Mr. Chen, you know so many principles.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “Try to refrain from such empty talk in the future. You’re not lacking in sycophants around me, you know.”

Zeng Ye, carrying the large bamboo box, turned sideways and laughed cheerfully, “Now it’s just me accompanying you, Mr. Chen, so I need to say more of these heartfelt compliments. Otherwise, if you go too long without hearing flattery, you might not know how to handle it!”

Chen Ping'an squinted his eyes in amusement, suddenly crouching down to skillfully shape a small snowman about the size of his palm, placing it atop Zeng Ye's bamboo box, leaving the tall youth bewildered.

Chen Ping'an clapped his hands, “Next, I’ll be practicing a basic stance. It’s quite simple: throw a punch every six steps. You can learn it, but you must ensure the little snowman doesn’t fall off the box. I’ll show you three times, and then throughout our journey, you can practice this stance at your leisure. I won’t push you; just treat it as a way to pass the time.”

After demonstrating the stance three times, Chen Ping'an observed as Zeng Ye focused intently on his footwork and the final punch he threw.

Chen Ping'an watched, letting Zeng Ye try it himself.

Zeng Ye’s stance was stable, significantly improved compared to the boy in straw sandals from Mud Bottle Alley years ago.

Yet, Chen Ping'an sighed inwardly, knowing that without understanding the essence of the punches, one could train for three years and still not grasp the basics.

Zeng Ye’s talent for martial arts was far inferior to that of the frail boy from the city of Yanzhi who had once stood before him holding a hatchet. 

However, that wasn’t a significant issue. As Chen Ping'an had said, it was merely a means for Zeng Ye to occupy himself and avoid the awkwardness of staring at one another throughout their journey. After all, the fox spirit papers couldn’t be taken out too often, and Chen Ping'an was genuinely wary of those increasingly lively and outspoken female spectral entities. 

While teasing Zeng Ye was fine, the way they flirted with him covertly was both absurd and humiliating. How many treacherous situations and tempests had Chen Ping'an weathered? 

Zeng Ye, after all, had been nurtured as a Qi practitioner on Maoyue Island, with a robust physique. Thus, he merely needed to practice the Mountain-Shaking Fist stance without Chen Ping'an revealing the truth to him. Zeng Ye was quite satisfied since the little snowman atop the bamboo box never tilted or fell.

After completing the three repetitions, Chen Ping'an stopped and periodically pulled out a geomancy map to peruse.

That evening, the two prepared to camp in a remote wilderness. As long as it didn’t snow, it would be fine.

Chen Ping'an took out a fox spirit paper, which contained a spectral entity named Su Xinzhi.

In life, she had been a practitioner at the Cave Dwelling realm, hailing from the Shihai Kingdom. Her father had favored sons over daughters, and when she was young, she was chosen by a Qi practitioner from a fairy cave in Shihai Kingdom for her innate talent, taken to Huangli Mountain, and had been cultivating there for over a decade without returning home. Su Xinzhi had long since severed any emotional ties to her family. Her father had once gone to the foot of Huangli Mountain to seek an audience with her, but Su Xinzhi had refused to see him, hoping her daughter would help her son succeed in the imperial exams. He returned empty-handed, cursing all the way, his words so harsh it was hard to imagine a father would speak like that. Su Xinzhi, who was secretly following him, heard every word clearly and was utterly heartbroken. Originally planning to assist her family once before completely severing ties with the mortal world, she decided to return to the mountain gate.

During her last descent from the mountain, she and her two junior sisters were captured by a patriarch from the Dragon Gate realm on Su Lin Island and tragically perished in the jaws of a dragon. The other two female disciples had already died at the hands of that patriarch.

Su Xinzhi appeared before them, her likeness depicted on the fox spirit paper, her smile enchanting and her eyes expressive. Among the twelve female spectral entities, she was the most open-minded and carefree, coming up with many playful ideas to tease Zeng Ye.

If they weren’t about to enter the territory of Huangli Mountain, Chen Ping'an wouldn’t dare to summon her.

Regarding the current situation at Huangli Mountain, Chen Ping'an had already informed Su Xinzhi of everything he knew from the beginning.

Her beloved master had passed away years ago, but Huangli Mountain was still relatively stable, being a second-tier fairyland of the Shihai Kingdom. It was neither too high nor too low, making it easier to avoid disasters amidst chaos. The third-rate lower-tier sects had long been absorbed by nearby fairy cave factions, while first-rate top-tier forces drew too much attention, facing overwhelming challenges in dealing with the Shihai Kingdom’s court or the Iron Cavalry of Dali; a single misstep could lead to annihilation.

Huangli Mountain had over thirty practitioners officially recorded as fairy masters, and with servants and female attendants included, there were roughly two hundred individuals.

Su Xinzhi’s last wish was to return to Huangli Mountain, light three incense sticks at her master’s grave and the ancestral hall, with no other desires, not even wishing to linger in the underworld or recreate the Crystal Pavilion.

Once Su Xinzhi appeared, surprisingly, she didn’t tease Zeng Ye or the steward at all.

Zeng Ye found this strange, but Chen Ping'an did not.

The feeling of approaching home brought about a sense of nervousness.

Seeing Su Xinzhi, Zeng Ye felt a bit of joy.

The heart of a youth, clear as crystal.

Chen Ping'an understood that Su Xinzhi was aware of this but pretended to be oblivious. The emotions of a young girl often place greater importance on first impressions than those of older women.

It’s a universal truth that men are moved by a woman's beauty, while women are captivated by a man's handsomeness—both are undeniable and not worth a fuss.

Poor Zeng Ye, this tall youth, was in a better situation than Zhu Xianfu’s ghostly cultivator Ma Yuanzhi, but still not by much.

Noticing Su Xinzhi’s furrowed brow, Chen Ping'an changed his mind and told Zeng Ye to sleep for another hour after practicing and then continue the journey overnight.

Zeng Ye, eager to do something for Su Xinzhi, pounded his chest loudly, prompting Chen Ping'an to facepalm. After all, he was still a fledgling who had yet to flutter through the flowers.

However, Chen Ping'an still granted Zeng Ye the opportunity to wander off alone, leaving Su Xinzhi by the campfire to “guard the path” for Zeng Ye as he practiced.

Chen Ping'an secretly left two flying swords behind and walked alone on the snow-laden, occasionally creaking mountain path.

Turning around, he found Su Xinzhi running towards him, deliberately stepping on the snow to create noise, leaving a long trail of footprints behind. This wasn’t because she had been a practitioner in life; rather, as a fox spirit paper beauty from the Xu family of Qingfeng City, it was easy for her to do so.

The sky was vast and full of wonders.

Cultivators, step by step, climb higher and see more beautiful sights than those at the mountain’s foot.

Su Xinzhi caught up to Chen Ping'an and walked alongside him, laughing, “Mr. Chen really isn’t good at playing matchmaker. Can’t you tell that I don’t have the slightest feeling for that silly boy Zeng Ye?”

Chen Ping'an forced a smile, “If you don’t feel anything, that’s fine. I won’t pressure you, but please don’t intentionally hurt his feelings. After all, Miss Su, you’ll be left with peace, while I still have to get along with that silly boy for several years.”

Su Xinzhi feigned surprise and grinned, “A godlike figure like Mr. Chen would care about a silly boy’s feelings? If he misbehaves, just give him a beating until he learns to behave. That’s how we wild cultivators of Shujian Lake do it; we don’t remember the good, only the punishments.”

Chen Ping'an replied, exasperated, “I can’t be bothered to deal with you.”

Su Xinzhi suddenly reached out to hook her arm through Chen Ping'an’s, only to have him jump away, glaring, “Isn’t that what you’re saying?”

Su Xinzhi covered her mouth with a laugh, bending down to make a snowball, casually asking, “What about that little charcoal burner you carry? I could help start a fire.”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “No need to waste charcoal. On Qingxia Island, we have plenty. Once it’s used up, someone will replenish it. Here, if it runs out, I’ll have to spend money at the market to buy more. It warms my hands, but it pains my heart.”

Although Su Xinzhi had encountered Chen Ping'an’s frugality multiple times during the journey, she still found it amusing.

She had asked that question specifically to hear that answer.

Walking ahead of Chen Ping'an, she began to walk backward, playfully saying, “When we get to Huangli Mountain, you absolutely must have a taste of the crispy, crispy sesame twists from Guihua Street at the foot of the mountain. Otherwise, this trip won’t be worth it. It would be best to buy a big bag to take with us.”

Chen Ping'an retorted, “You’re paying for it, right?”

Su Xinzhi rolled her eyes, “Oh, my dear Mr. Chen, you traveled all this way, and you’re still worried about a few taels of silver?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “You clearly don’t know how to manage your finances but still have the audacity to look down on the honest and upright Zeng Ye?”

Su Xinzhi was so incensed that she threw the snowball in her hand, which Chen Ping'an easily dodged, already preparing to make another snowball. He hastily said, “Stop, stop! I really don’t want Zeng Ye to misunderstand us.”

Su Xinzhi actually stopped, teasing, “Is Mr. Chen truly a sea that can't be stirred, or do you have the heart of a thief but lack the courage of one?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “That’s not for outsiders to know.”

Su Xinzhi looked at the young man’s eyes and made a funny face, “Oh, oh, oh, so our wooden man, Mr. Chen, really has someone he likes! Alas, I lost another bet.”

Chen Ping'an simply smiled in response.

In the end, he let Su Xinzhi return to Zeng Ye while he continued to wander off on his own.

Su Xinzhi teased him for being a crafty old fox at a young age, not knowing how many girls he had harmed to develop such meticulous thoughts.

Chen Ping'an took it as a compliment and didn’t argue with her.

Su Xinzhi returned to Zeng Ye’s side and squatted by the campfire.

Chen Ping'an took a long time to return.

Once Zeng Ye finished his practice and saw Su Xinzhi beside him, he could only smile foolishly.

After Chen Ping'an came back, they continued their journey.

As they approached the territory of the fairy cave, Chen Ping'an refrained from using the other nine fox spirit papers. In the past, when passing temples dedicated to mountain and water deities or the dual temples of the city god, he usually did the same.

In fact, the talisman from Shujian Lake’s Qingxia Island didn’t require any worries about potential minor disturbances. Moreover, the Shihai Kingdom, being close to the wild cultivators all over Shujian Lake, had grown accustomed to the bizarre and extraordinary incidents that occurred in other small nations. However, Chen Ping'an insisted on this approach, and Su Xinzhi along with the other nine spectral entities could only grumble about it, almost like they were playfully pouting at an elder.

At dusk, a ghost and two people arrived at the small town at the foot of Huangli Mountain. Before ascending the mountain, although Chen Ping'an had expressed reluctance to spend money, he still bought a bag of crispy sesame twists from Guihua Street—the most expensive kind with assorted fillings—and shared them with Su Xinzhi and Zeng Ye. After taking a few bites, he surprisingly turned around and bought two more large bags, secretly stowing them away when no one was watching. Noticing Su Xinzhi’s smile, Chen Ping'an chose to ignore it.

The two cultivators guarding the mountain gate of Huangli Mountain were both disciples of lower quality in the Fifth Realm, one old and one young.

When Chen Ping'an presented the spirit-rich jade token from Qingxia Island and briefly explained his purpose, both were taken aback, showing no intention to report to their superiors, and promptly led the three up the mountain.

Chen Ping'an did not conceal Su Xinzhi’s identity and those two matters from Huangli Mountain.

The older cultivator actually remembered Su Xinzhi’s name, as she had once been regarded as a highly promising prodigy by Huangli Mountain. However, the tragic events at the foot of the mountain had left Huangli Mountain with no inclination to hold anyone accountable; instead, they had even taken the initiative to send someone to Shujian Lake’s Su Lin Island to apologize to the patriarch, who was a Dragon Gate realm old immortal. Of course, there was also a mindset of “turning misfortune into blessings,” hoping to establish some ties with Su Lin Island to put up a banner at the peak of Huangli Mountain and intimidate distant and nearby enemy sects. Unfortunately, the patriarch had not allowed the Huangli Mountain cultivators to enter the mountain gate at that time, leaving them utterly humiliated. Thankfully, after returning to Huangli Mountain, the cultivator had intentionally released some ambiguous rumors privately that still brought tangible benefits to his sect.

So when they heard a high-ranking offering from Qingxia Island had appeared, the older cultivator didn’t dare to neglect him.

Soon, the elder of Huangli Mountain stepped out from his residence, accompanied by several powerful cultivators from the mountain, to personally welcome the esteemed Chen Dazhong.

For the Shihai Kingdom, which had over a thousand islands in Shujian Lake and tens of thousands of unruly wild cultivators, more than a hundred islands needed to be remembered, among which were over ten major islands, including Qingzhuang, Lizu, and Tianmou, that needed to be firmly etched in memory. As for Qingxia Island, which had produced a Yuanying ancestor known as the “True Monarch of the River Crossing,” it was even more revered, nearly regarded as the highest place in the world. Huangli Mountain was unaware of the recent upheavals in Shujian Lake over the past two months, but regarding Liu Zhimo’s smooth ascension to the position of leader of the martial world, nearly all the cultivators atop the mountain were aware of it, except for those sects that were secluded and cut off from the world.

When Su Xinzhi saw the familiar face of the Huangli Mountain elder, tears filled her eyes, and she immediately knelt down, crying uncontrollably.

This action startled the elder and everyone from Huangli Mountain.

Chen Ping'an then gently reiterated the words he had previously shared with the mountain gate’s cultivators.

These statements were all ideas Su Xinzhi had formulated herself.

Chen Ping'an was merely repeating them.

 ### Chapter 493: The Soul Returns to the Earth

After Huang Li Mountain uncovered the “truth,” everyone felt a weight lift off their shoulders. The now transformed Su Xinzai, once a little girl, was met with warmth and genuine concern from the old master of the Observing the Sea realm, who had always struggled to reach the Dragon Gate level. As they settled in, he expressed his heartfelt greetings to her, a sentiment that resonated deeply with the practitioners of Huang Li Mountain, leaving them rather moved by Su Xinzai's nostalgia.

Soon after, Su Xinzai made her way to the Grand Master's Hall to pay her respects, carrying incense personally handed to her by the Grand Master of Huang Li Mountain. 

Eventually, she arrived at her master’s grave, accompanied only by Chen Ping'an and Zeng Ye, as she politely declined the company of the Grand Master and the other senior practitioners.

A middle-aged practitioner watched the departing figures and couldn't help but murmur, “This Chen Gongfang, who came all the way from Qingxia Island, truly… one cannot judge a person by appearance.”

The Grand Master of Huang Li Mountain chuckled, “What does that even mean? Are you praising him or belittling him? If Chen Gongfang were here, I’m afraid with just that comment, our little Huang Li Mountain would be in for some trouble.”

However, the Grand Master quickly stroked his beard and laughed, “But it’s true, one cannot judge a book by its cover. He looks ordinary and doesn’t carry any flashy treasures. If it weren’t for that worship token, I’d find it hard to believe such a young cultivator is already a top disciple of Qingxia Island! Amazing! We, a bunch of old bones, can’t even compare.”

Before the middle-aged practitioner could respond, the Grand Master glanced at him and shook his head slightly. “Given the situation, do we really need to do anything more? If we’re going to complain about good fortune, we might as well be wasting our time.”

The middle-aged practitioner nodded in understanding.

Though they had walked some distance, Su Xinzai keenly noticed Chen Ping'an's helpless expression and asked with a smile, “What’s wrong? Did the Grand Master say something behind my back?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head with a smile, “No, they were saying good things about me.”

Curious, Su Xinzai inquired, “Well, if they say Chen Xiansheng is young and accomplished, that’s acceptable, and you can graciously accept it. But if they praise your handsome looks and remarkable demeanor? You mustn’t take that seriously.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, “Indeed, it seems like you and the practitioners of Huang Li Mountain share the same taste in judgment.”

Su Xinzai laughed.

After that, she began to walk a bit slower.

Chen Ping'an naturally matched her pace.

In a relatively serene area of Huang Li Mountain, where the spiritual energy was far from that of Qingxia Island, in front of a grave, Su Xinzai completed her offering and bowed her head.

After a long pause, she hesitated to rise.

Chen Ping'an squatted a distance away, gently playing with a handful of soil.

Zeng Ye gazed at Su Xinzai’s figure from afar, his heart heavy with sorrow.

Once Su Xinzai stood up, wiping her tears, she walked over to Chen Ping'an, her expression now serene, her eyes free of sorrow.

Chen Ping'an discarded the soil and stood up.

Su Xinzai smiled, “You can take back the talisman now, Chen Xiansheng.”

Chen Ping'an hesitated, ultimately saying little as he retrieved the fox fur talisman and tucked it into his sleeve.

Before him stood only the woman who had returned to her original form, now an ethereal presence.

Chen Ping'an asked, “Are you truly unwilling to remain within the fox fur talisman? Even with the grand ceremony and the water and land rituals, reincarnation still…”

Su Xinzai shook her head, “I have no regrets, not even a bit.”

She took a few steps back, smiled at the pale figure of the bookkeeper, and gracefully bowed in farewell.

Turning to Zeng Ye, whose eyes were glistening, she smiled, “Silly boy, stick with Chen Xiansheng and cultivate well. Remember, you must reach the Middle Five Realms and become a Celestial Immortal!”

Zeng Ye nodded vigorously.

Then she looked at Chen Ping'an and softly said, “May you, Chen Xiansheng, have your wishes fulfilled and live without worry.”

Chen Ping'an asked hoarsely, “Have you thought it through?”

Su Xinzai continued, “May you, Chen Xiansheng, become a celestial couple with that girl you admire.”

Taking a deep breath, Chen Ping'an clasped his fists, “May I one day meet Su Gu niang again.”

With tears streaming down her face, Su Xinzai smiled brightly, “Please don’t forget me when that time comes!”

Chen Ping'an nodded gently.

Su Xinzai tilted her head slightly, gazing into the young man’s eyes, seemingly trying to discern any deceit. Then she suddenly laughed, “Ah, I just realized that our Chen Xiansheng is quite handsome after all.”

Chen Ping'an forced a smile, trembling slightly, and gave her a thumbs up, “Your taste isn’t bad, Miss.”

With no lingering attachments, Su Xinzai began to dissipate, her essence scattering like a painting of a noblewoman, burning away to ashes, returning to the heavens and earth.

Chen Ping'an waved her goodbye.

Zeng Ye covered his face and wept.

Finally, Chen Ping'an patted the boy’s shoulder, “Let’s go.”

Zeng Ye hung his head, nodding slightly.

Chen Ping'an spoke softly, “If you truly liked Su Gu niang, and since you never found the chance to confess, it’s alright; in the coming decades, even if you search the world over, you must see her once more and tell her you like her. If a hundred years isn’t enough, then work hard to become a Celestial Immortal who can contend with the heavens for longevity. As long as you still like her then, you can travel thousands of miles while diligently cultivating, and searching for her for a thousand years would be worthwhile.”

Zeng Ye suddenly looked up, choking back his tears, “But I have poor aptitude.”

Chen Ping'an replied sternly, “Zeng Ye, until you put in effort that far exceeds the ordinary, you have no right to claim you lack talent! You can tell others that a thousand times, but here, with me, you can only say it once!”

Zeng Ye was left in a daze.

Chen Ping'an took a step forward, giving Zeng Ye one last piece of advice, “I’ll wait for you at the mountain gate. Before that, I’ll say my farewells to the practitioners of Huang Li Mountain; you don’t need to follow. Some things, you can say alone. Whether or not you express them, it doesn’t matter. What matters is whether you can remember them deeply; that’s the proof of how much you liked Su Gu niang. But let me say something you may not want to hear: even if months or years from now you find someone else you like, I won’t think less of you, Zeng Ye. But… if you can always remember Su Gu niang, I will think highly of you.”

Leaving Zeng Ye behind, Chen Ping'an returned to thank and bid farewell to the practitioners of Huang Li Mountain.

He slowly descended the mountain.

Sitting at the bottom of the mountain gate steps, he turned around to see a tall youth running down.

In the noble district of Songhe Street in the Shihao Kingdom, there stood the prestigious Ma family estate, known for its illustrious lineage. After giving birth to a daughter more precious than royal kin, the family's reputation soared even higher. Within this grand state, they enjoyed significant respect, to the point that even the proud and aloof Governor would send someone to visit during festive seasons.

As the new year approached, on this morning, the sound of hooves echoed on the bluestone streets as three riders entered the street early.

Due to the war spreading into the central part of Shihao Kingdom, this year’s celebrations on Songhe Street were far from the usual joyous atmosphere.

The three riders dismounted.

One young man, looking listless, wore a blue cotton robe but carried a sword like a wandering knight.

Accompanying him were two individuals holding the horses, a graceful woman whose features were hidden beneath her veil, and a stout young man carrying a bamboo box.

The doorman, a middle-aged man dressed in attire befitting a local gentry, yawned and glanced at the leading stranger with annoyance. However, upon hearing that this person hails from the Qingxia Island of Shujian Lake, he suddenly woke up, his sleepiness vanishing. He quickly bowed and assured the young immortal to wait a moment while he reported to the family head. The doorman hurried off, not forgetting to smile and assure the young immortal not to rush; he would return promptly.

After a while, the sweating doorman returned, flanked by a thin, elegant man with gray hair at his temples.

Behind them followed an unhurried but steady elder, resembling a scholar.

The woman beneath the veil had already teared up, biting her lip to hold back her emotions.

Chen Ping'an took out the worship token, which the old gentleman received, carefully examining it before respectfully returning it to Chen Ping'an, speaking softly, “I did not expect the honored immortal to visit; I apologize for not welcoming you properly.”

The head of the Ma family, suppressing his surprise and reverence, quickly invited the three from Qingxia Island into the estate.

Though the head of the Ma family intended to display sincerity by opening the ceremonial gates, he was gently refused by the young immortal.

Chen Ping'an, recalling the arrangement he had made long ago regarding the illustrious daughter of the Ma family, addressed the family head directly, “Ma Duyi is in Shujian Lake. Originally, he was a cultivator from Songfeng Island, apprenticed to an old cultivator named Shao Dongtian. He had no hope of attaining the Dao, but later, he had the fortune to truly delve into cultivation and is now, by my lineage, considered a nephew. Thus, I came to visit your family during my travels.”

His words, as a guest, were rather blunt, condescending, fitting for a cultivator from Shujian Lake, and resonating with the demeanor of a top-tier immortal in Shihao Kingdom.

However, both the head of the Ma family and the family’s patron actually found such directness appropriate.

Otherwise, they would have to weigh the authenticity of this young man’s status as a patron. Given the precarious situation of the Ma family, they couldn’t afford to be deceived. They preferred to treat him well, but quickly send him off, ensuring no complications arose. After all, what the Ma family truly required was not superficial favors but genuine help in their time of need.

Although they remained somewhat skeptical about the young man’s claim of being a patron from Qingxia Island, they leaned more towards belief, leading to increasingly polite, almost flattering remarks.

After all, flattery costs nothing.

The Ma family’s current standing was not merely a result of generations studying ancient texts.

The only trouble was that the Ma family had been too prosperous in recent decades, trying to profit from every opportunity, which ultimately led to significant troubles. They were willing to spend money to resolve issues but feared that the wealth spent might not yield protective charms but rather a death warrant.

If this young immortal was truly Ma Duyi’s new master uncle, it would indeed be a blessing!

In the current Shihao Kingdom, from the capital to the localities, the emergence of a substantial immortal cultivator carried more weight than the highest officials in the six ministries!

Upon entering the grand hall of the estate, Chen Ping'an remained succinct, stating that he knew Ma Duyi well and that if the Ma family faced difficulties, he could offer some assistance. If the family business was stable, they could consider whether there were appropriate candidates for cultivation; if such fortune arose, it could be arranged for that talented individual to study at Shujian Lake or to leave behind a sum of immortal money, both options being viable.

Three days later, the three riders left the city.

The woman, still wearing her veil, took one last look at the city wall, her gaze complex.

The Ma family’s urgent crisis was alleviated after a young patron from Qingxia Island made an appearance and visited the Governor's estate, allowing them to weather the storm.

A Ma family child, boasting a cultivation level around the fourth or fifth realm of Qi Refining, secured a place under an old immortal’s tutelage in the state city. This was not a nominal apprentice; rather, it was a genuine disciple, officially recorded in the government’s archives. This meant that with a renowned master, the family would have a steady influx of money from the immortal, which would not all be used to clear the child's path in cultivation. Regardless, that child would no longer have to worry about their future, and would receive a portion of tangible benefits.

Chen Ping'an sat on horseback, silent.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 494: A Meeting on a Narrow Path**

Even a youth as naïve as Zeng Ye, who struggled with the intricacies of human emotions, could sense the chill in the air at the Ma residence over the past few days. From the head of the Ma family to that woman, it was clear that they had long lost any warmth toward their daughter, Ma Duyi, who had long since left their side. Their conversations were filled with cautious inquiries—about Ma Duyi's sect lineage, her cultivation level, and indirectly probing whether any young disciples had a romantic partner. In short, they barely scratched the surface of Ma Duyi's transformation from a cultivator of Pine Wind Island to one of Azure Gorge Island. It felt like a mere formality, like small talk at a banquet or in official circles—utterly meaningless exchanges that had to be made to avoid an awkward atmosphere.

The estrangement between parent and child might stem from Ma Duyi's long absence from home. Her struggles in cultivation on Pine Wind Island had disappointed their ancestral master, and she had remained a mere Fifth Stage cultivator until her death, unable to return home to visit her family. The distance between them had grown; perhaps her parents felt their status had become too dissimilar, or perhaps they simply preferred the immediate joys of children born into the family over a daughter who had "married far away." The reasons could be countless, but the reality was undeniable.

At this moment, any words from outsiders would only feel like knives stabbing at the heart, causing pain with every syllable.

Thus, when Chen Ping'an took a break from riding, he subtly gestured to Zeng Ye, urging the earnest young man, who wanted to offer words of comfort, to hold his tongue.

Chen Ping'an didn't pocket the fox fur beauty talisman that Ma Duyi had sent him; instead, he allowed her to ride freely alongside them as they journeyed to their next destination.

Two days later, Zeng Ye's gaze began to shift noticeably, though his appearance and voice remained unchanged. However, the eyes of a person are the windows to their soul, and they can easily influence how others perceive their overall demeanor.

Ma Duyi finally seemed to shake off her previous daze; perhaps she found Zeng Ye's current state to be somewhat amusing.

A wandering spirit from Azure Gorge Island had begun to possess Zeng Ye. This was different from the usual practices of summoning spirits or inviting deities that common mountain cultivators employed.

As for the true nature of this occurrence, Ma Duyi certainly could not discern its depth.

They approached a rural village and spotted a hunchbacked old woman. Clad in simple, clean clothes, despite some patches, she didn't exude an air of decay. She was returning from the stream, carrying a large bamboo basket, her steps unsteady.

For an elderly villager, this was no easy task. Life had its many trials, and living in poverty without much complaint was no small feat. For a poor person to live like a wealthy one was as difficult as soaring to the heavens, but to live comfortably and carefree was even harder.

Zeng Ye dismounted, stumbling forward, and knelt beside the old woman, banging his head against the ground with a loud thud.

The old woman looked bewildered, hurriedly setting down the bamboo basket and ignoring her freshly washed clothes that might get muddy from the ground. She crouched down with some effort, wanting to help the strange boy up, speaking in a dialect that neither Chen Ping'an nor Ma Duyi understood, "What are you doing? What are you doing? No, no, no..."

That night, within the old woman's humble abode, a fox fur beauty had appeared, though it was, in reality, a man. On the table lay a pile of spirit money left behind by a departed soul, enough spiritual energy to sustain him for twenty years.

He intended to ensure the old woman's peaceful passing, allowing her to live out her remaining years in comfort.

After the guest had left, the old woman and her "grandson," who had been away from home for far too long, held each other's hands, weeping as they sat face to face.

On the winding country road, the trio continued their journey.

Zeng Ye still felt a bit dazed, needing to take deep breaths to steady himself.

The three riders made their way slowly back.

Suddenly, Ma Duyi spoke up, "That old woman is a good person, but when she learns the truth, she shouldn’t have spoken to you like that. A life for a life is reasonable, but what does that have to do with you?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "I think it should be said this way; that's the correct approach."

Ma Duyi snorted in annoyance, saying, "Look at that old villager—she's more nostalgic than my heartless parents!"

Chen Ping'an turned and laughed, "Are you angry? If you want, we can go back to the state capital, and I'll help you reclaim that spirit money. I can also scold your parents for you. The usual arrangement: you draft the words, and I'll speak them."

Sitting leisurely on her horse, Ma Duyi spat at the steward, "Not a chance! You’re just a greedy steward thinking about what little money you can make."

Chen Ping'an burst into laughter.

Ma Duyi suddenly smiled, saying, "Do you know why my parents named me this? Because before I was born, the midwife insisted I was going to be a big, fat son. But when my father heard I was a girl, he stood there dumbfounded, stomping his feet in anger, and left. Yet he eventually stormed back, and my mother often told me that when my father first saw me, I was like a finely crafted jade, not at all like the ugly children around. He was so happy."

"By the way, do you know why I'm named 'Duyi'? I'm asking you, Chen the Great Scholar!"

Chen Ping'an smiled and shook his head.

Ma Duyi mimicked the exasperated tutor from her childhood, shaking her head and saying, "With great talent, paired with diligence, the heart and hands working in harmony, one can walk the path—the right path!"

Chen Ping'an asked, "Isn’t it ‘walking alone in the world’?"

Ma Duyi laughed heartily, "Alright, Chen the Scholar, you’ve caught me with my fox tail showing!"

Chen Ping'an replied helplessly, "Alright, alright, you’re clever."

Ma Duyi turned to him and softly asked, "Mr. Chen, what’s our purpose in all of this?"

Chen Ping'an loosened the reins, cradled the back of his head in his arms, and murmured, "Yes, why indeed?"

Ma Duyi gazed at his thin face, feeling a pang of sadness that had nothing to do with love; it simply made her heart ache, causing her to suppress her own emotions for a moment.

Suddenly, the man in the cotton robe clapped his hands together, exclaiming, "I've got an answer!"

Ma Duyi looked at him with curiosity.

The steward, whose sword was sheathed at his waist, now wore a rare smile, "Indeed! That’s exactly it!"

Ma Duyi chuckled, though she retorted, "What a load of nonsense."

Chen Ping'an, with his hands tucked in his sleeves, warned, "If you keep complaining, I might just take you in."

Ma Duyi, unafraid, brushed it off, "Where to next?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, squinted into the distance, and softly murmured, "Well, it's still in the mortal realm."

Ma Duyi suddenly exclaimed, "Indeed!"

Chen Ping'an laughed in agreement, "Good."

The horse's hooves faded away from the sounds of roosters crowing and dogs barking in the village.

This year's final and biggest snowfall arrived unexpectedly.

As the wind and snow deepened, they had long left the village behind.

Ma Duyi, being a spirit, was not the least bit afraid of the heavy snow. She even recited poetry, saying that the snow resembled flying seagulls, and when she looked back, she could see the eaves of the houses deep in the village, where the wind split the air...

Chen Ping'an, riding his horse, frequently turned his head to look around, trying to find shelter from the wind and snow. He couldn’t help but shiver and complain, "Where’s this wind splitting the air? It’s clearly freezing me to death..."

Ma Duyi, grinning, asked, "Mr. Chen, is it still 'the right path' or not?"

Chen Ping'an ignored her, shifting from sitting on the horse to standing on its back, trying to scan the surroundings. After a moment, he finally spotted some distant flickers of light.

Furrowing his brows, he realized that this stretch of road was a return journey, and according to his memory, there shouldn’t have been any lights in that direction.

Just as he intended to brave the biting cold of the wind and snow and avoid the faint lights, he noticed that the flickering glow seemed to be slowly moving. If nothing unexpected happened, the lights would eventually converge with the three riders ahead.

Chen Ping'an felt a sense of calm wash over him. In such weather, something that could track them from such a distance and seemed to be lingering, was likely not a bandit or thief, but if it were a mountain cultivator or a spirit, it would save him some trouble.

The world is vast, and sometimes, survival isn't easy, but seeking death is the easiest task.

Ma Duyi was a bit worried; she finally noticed the strange phenomenon in the distance and softly asked, "Mr. Chen, should we take a detour?"

Chen Ping'an replied indifferently, "No need."

Ma Duyi was taken aback.

Only at that moment, after leaving the Book Simple Lake, did Ma Duyi remember that after getting used to the easygoing steward, this Mr. Chen was someone who, when he decided not to be easygoing, could be more difficult than anyone else!

A meeting on a narrow path.

A group of over thirty light cavalry halted slowly. The snow covered their bows and swords, making them appear exceptionally fierce.

About half of the riders held torches. The leading riders, not clad in standard armor, surrounded a young man whose face was as handsome as jade. The young man, cloaked in white fox fur, squinted at the three riders through the swirling snow, his thin red lips pressed together, appearing like a graceful noble.

To his left, three attendants were close by; on one side stood a burly man clutching a long spear, its tip glimmering bright under the torchlight held by the riders behind him.

On the other side was a lean, wiry man, arms crossed, who carried no bow or sword, yet the sides of his saddle were adorned with several bloodied and frozen heads.

To the young man's right stood a middle-aged man, around forty, with a dull expression, carrying a long sword sheathed in pine wood with a handle shaped like a ganoderma mushroom. The man often covered his mouth to cough.

The young man seemed closest to the middle-aged swordsman, leaning slightly towards him as he sat atop his horse.

After the middle-aged swordsman coughed, he glanced at the three riders about fifty steps away and quietly said, "Your Highness, as I mentioned earlier, there are indeed two people and one ghost. The woman is a seductive ghost, wearing fox fur, and it’s highly likely she is made from a special fox fur beauty talisman uniquely crafted by the Xu family of Qingfeng City."

As he spoke, the middle-aged swordsman reached out as if to catch some snowflakes, but suddenly, a small, delicate creature appeared in his palm. It was entirely snow-white, with a pair of wings on its back, blending seamlessly with the snowstorm. At such close range, the little thing was barely noticeable. This must be the so-called fairy scout, its function akin to a deity observing mountains and rivers, just one relied on magic while the other relied on living creatures.

"Thank you for your hard work," the man smiled at the little creature in his palm, then took out a delicate blue-and-white porcelain jar from his sleeve, letting the fairy dart inside before slowly retracting the jar into his sleeve.

The young man, referred to as "Your Highness" by the swordsman, raised an eyebrow, his eyes glowing with excitement as he leaned even closer. "Mr. Zeng, I've heard of the Xu family in Qingfeng City, but my mother wouldn’t let me leave the capital to manage the fief, delaying it for eight years. I’ve been stuck in the capital mansion, avoiding suspicion and saving ink money for the censors at the Imperial Edict Hall. I’ve never had the chance to interact with the mountain's immortal masters. What exactly is this fox fur beauty talisman, and what makes it so wonderful? Mr. Zeng, with your vast knowledge and experience traveling half the continent, please enlighten me?"

As the young man spoke, the middle-aged swordsman, perhaps due to the biting cold of the wind and snow, seemed a bit fatigued. He took out a porcelain bottle and poured two emerald-green pills, the size of soybeans, into his hand. After popping them into his mouth, his complexion improved slightly, and he even wore a smile as he spoke, "The Xu family possesses an ancient fox hill that has been home to foxes for a thousand years. They form an alliance with the Xu family and send a few pieces of fox fur aged between one hundred to three hundred years every year to create talismans that are sold across various regions of Baoping Continent, becoming quite popular. Most of the earth immortal mansions, not lacking in spirit money, often have a few fox fur beauties as maids and servants. These talisman beauties, once activated, are indistinguishable from living people; the ghostly woman before us is likely one of them. If a mountain immortal with a good relationship with the Xu family wishes to purchase a fox fur beauty talisman, they can even send a portrait of their desired woman's likeness, and the Xu family will have someone carve it on the fur. Several of the old disciples are skilled artists in this field and have never disappointed buyers."

The young man’s eyes lit up as he gazed at the distant "woman," his gaze becoming increasingly covetous.

Although he had not left the capital to manage his fief for many years, he had not wasted his time in the capital either. His greatest vice was disguising himself as a failed scholar or a wanderer in the capital, sampling the charms of various women, especially the wives and daughters of the censors at the Imperial Edict Hall. Any woman or girl with a hint of beauty had fallen victim to his charms, so he could casually peruse the reprimands flooding into the Emperor's study, feeling no guilt for the insults he hurled at the old officials. After all, despite the seemingly stern and fearsome imperial household, they always doted on their son, and his mother had quite a subtle hand in controlling the family. The Emperor was kept in line, dutifully obeying, and even in private, the three of them could joke without shame, laughing heartily.

However, after living such a comfortable life for so long, he always felt something was missing.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 495: The Prince Blocks the Way

He was destined to be an emperor, so he couldn’t afford to be a mere Fifth Stage Immortal. He couldn’t endure the hardships of refining his body or practicing the stances of martial arts, let alone the grim realities of leading troops into battle. The thought of kill or be killed left him feeling indifferent.

Thus, he couldn’t help but harbor some resentment toward his mother. Was he not the crown prince? Now he wasn’t even the virtuous king. Did his mother truly favor him, or was she just keeping him around like a useless pet? Those two brothers of his were both the illegitimate children of the former empress. Looking at his current miserable state, he felt like a stray dog, kicked out of his home, wandering aimlessly outside the capital. The rustic women he encountered were wearing on his nerves; no matter how beautiful they were, they couldn't compare to the refined ladies of noble families who knew how to serve a man.

To make matters worse, when he quietly left the capital, his mother had issued a death order, insisting he personally lead troops to slay the scouts of the Great Li (Dali) Empire. Was she not forcing him onto a path of no return? He didn’t have much faith in the hollow facade of the Zhu Ying Dynasty; deep down, he yearned to ally himself with the strong and powerful Great Li barbarians. If he were on the dragon throne right now, he would have opened the city gates to welcome Su Gaoshan personally. What fun was there in warfare? He wanted to witness the battlefield where thousands of practitioners engaged in combat; that was true celestial fighting, not the petty squabbling of ants on horseback.

However, this outing to clear his mind hadn’t been entirely unfruitful; he had encountered a stunning fox spirit that was as lively as any human.

The young prince couldn’t help but smile.

The three riders had also stopped for a long while, confronting his elite cavalry with a kind of steadfastness.

The prince of the Shihou Kingdom, Han Jingxin, was notorious both in the court and among the people, and his smile grew wider.

Boldly, the other party had yet to yield the road.

It was no wonder he had a stunning fox beauty by his side; he must be one of those wild cultivators from the Shujian Lake—rebellious and unruly—or perhaps a well-connected celestial master from within the Shihou Kingdom. Young and brash, he could understand.

Too bad, though, that in such desolate wilderness, status meant little.

On a night like this, with snow falling and bloodshed in the air, Han Jingxin felt invigorated. The earlier skirmish had been a trivial affair; he had only taken the life of an elderly official from the Yu Shi Tai who had been slow in returning to the capital after autumn. If one were to blame, it was his lineage for failing to produce a daughter of decent appearance, leaving him unable to marry someone attractive. Thus, there was no affection to speak of. He vented his frustrations freely, even dragging his father and mother into his tirade, and he had gained a reputation as an iron-willed commentator in the scholarly circles. It was bad enough that the old man had retired from office but still enjoyed complaining, stopping frequently along the way to exchange views with the inept scholars.

So, Han Jingxin planned to play the dutiful son, catch up to that convoy, and take his time to deal with the old man. After listening to years of complaints, he wanted to see the old man hunched on the snowy ground, clutching his belly, and found it truly pitiful. He swiftly dealt with the old man by severing his head, now hanging from the saddle of that martial arts master, and in the return journey through the snow, the silent head left Han Jingxin feeling somewhat uneasy.

In one hand, he toyed with a jade pendant—just a trinket from the mountain, not a real celestial treasure. It was warm in winter and cool in summer, supposedly produced from Yunxia Mountain and classified as a decent spiritual artifact. Han Jingxin raised his other hand and waved, signaling the three riders to clear the way.

To his delight, the three riders slowly turned their horses, yielding a path.

Han Jingxin laughed. Could there truly be such naive cultivators in the world?

“Over there,” Ma Duyi softly reminded, “Mr. Chen, they don’t seem like proper officials.”

Chen Pingan nodded and spoke words that made both Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye uncomfortable, perfectly suited for the biting wind and snow of the night.

“I know they won’t back down. If we yield a little, it’ll embolden them to act bolder when they do.”

Zeng Ye’s expression stiffened, unsure if it was from the cold or from those words.

Chen Pingan didn’t glance at the timid tall youth and continued, “If we lack the ability, it’s us who will die. Ma Duyi will suffer the most. If you can’t understand this now, focus on your cultivation on the mountain later and stay out of the world.”

Han Jingxin gestured again, and the cavalry behind him expertly advanced but did not charge; they merely formed a small fan-shaped obstruction.

It was clear.

The earlier signal for the three riders to yield was merely a cat-and-mouse trick, an appetizer before the main course, which was not yet served.

Chen Pingan suddenly asked, “Zeng Ye, if Ma Duyi and I weren’t here tonight, and it was just you and Su Xinzai facing this cavalry, what would you do?”

Zeng Ye paused for a moment before sweat broke out on his forehead.

Chen Pingan said nothing more.

Some truths were simply unpalatable; no matter how much others explained, if the listener hadn’t experienced a similar situation, it was hard to empathize, unless disaster struck.

But those who couldn’t wrap their heads around certain truths were, in fact, the lucky ones.

Those who had suffered misfortune, upon encountering similar situations, needed no one to preach; they understood intuitively.

Yet that was not all; what truly made Chen Pingan feel increasingly uneasy was that he realized those who harbored malice toward the world seemed to learn from hardship and remember it deeply, even turning small losses into lessons on how to navigate life—how to leverage power, how to harm others for personal gain, how one person’s rise could lead to others’ ascension, all depending on the mood and interests of the one who had attained enlightenment.

Chen Pingan hoped that his perspective was wrong, the more wrong, the better.

Why should good people be expected to be smarter than bad ones to live well?

He exhaled a breath of foul air and pointed ahead at the young man among the cavalry, “You may not have noticed or had the chance to see, but I’ve seen his face twice in the reports from the Yanshu Island at your Shujian Lake. His name is Han Jingxin, the half-brother of Han Jingling, well-known in the capital of the Shihou Kingdom, and he is the favored son of the empress.”

Chen Pingan rubbed his palms, “I’ve dealt with a prince of similar status to Han Jingling and Han Jingxin in Tongye Prefecture, but those two seem to have sharper wits. Regardless of the outcome, they at least calculate their moves; this prince here seems to prefer a more head-on approach.”

Ma Duyi’s expression shifted slightly.

Chen Pingan smiled, “No need to worry; no one knows your true identity, and your family won’t be implicated.”

Ma Duyi snapped, “Did you need to tell me that? I’m worried you might act recklessly and end up losing your life, dragging me into trouble with that lecherous prince!”

Chen Pingan understood that Ma Duyi was genuinely concerned for his safety. As for the latter remark, it was likely just her feminine instinct to downplay her true feelings by framing them as complaints.

He turned to her with a smile, “I’ve never suggested you turn back, have I?”

Zeng Ye’s mind was preoccupied with thoughts of that Su girl, pondering how he would respond if Mr. Chen’s situation arose. His mind was a muddle, and he didn’t quite grasp the intent behind Mr. Chen’s words.

Ma Duyi, however, was sharp-minded and keen, which was why she had reached the Fifth Stage at a young age. If she hadn’t encountered that calamity, when facing the flood dragon, she might have been reckless, but she could have pursued the path to the Dragon Gate realm in Shujian Lake, establishing a sect on an island with connections to the ancestors of her sect.

Though Ma Duyi had caught on to Chen Pingan’s implication, she still looked worried, “Mr. Chen, are you truly going to clash with that prince?”

She rushed to explain, “Of course, I’m not speaking on behalf of the cavalry. It’s just that our Shujian Lake has never favored conflicts of this nature. Either we don’t engage, or we eliminate them entirely. If we clash with Han Jingxin, we’ll be heading deeper into the Shihou Kingdom and through many northern states. Won’t that complicate things and delay your important matters?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “I’ll handle it. Murder has never been the objective. However, this Han Jingxin seems to have developed a taste for bloodshed since leaving the capital. Among his followers, there are several heads hanging from saddles, and they don’t appear to be Great Li scouts. This suggests he isn’t doing it for military merit but rather out of a desire for revenge.”

Chen Pingan casually drew a line in the air.

This left Zeng Ye confused, as well as Ma Duyi, who had snow piled on her shoulders.

Chen Pingan slapped his forehead and turned to Ma Duyi, “I forgot I could keep you in my sleeve.”

Ma Duyi covered her mouth, giggling.

On Han Jingxin’s side, upon seeing the fox spirit’s alluring figure, he felt a surge of warmth, convinced that the heavy snowfall tonight had not been in vain.

He asked with a grin, “If I kill a few unknown cultivators, will it cause problems for Mr. Zeng?”

The middle-aged swordsman shook his head, “Killing cultivators isn’t a problem. This heavy snow will help immensely in covering our tracks. We just need to be careful. The issue lies with that convoy several dozen miles away. Your Highness intentionally left the bodies unburied, making it easy for someone to trace them back to you. If the three riders are indeed celestial masters from a prominent sect or wild cultivators from the islands of Shujian Lake, it will only spell trouble for you. Therefore, Your Highness has three options.”

“First, since we’ve made such a show, let’s take a page from their book and withdraw a bit. You can openly reveal your identity to that young cultivator who appears to be injured and offer to buy the fox spirit from him with money—using your status to intimidate him. That’s the safest option. Second, let’s just pass by as if nothing happened. You’ll only miss out on a romantic opportunity. Third, you can order an attack, but remember to clean up the remains of that convoy afterwards to prevent any clues from being found. Generally speaking, if mountain cultivators grow suspicious, they won’t bother reasoning with you.”

Han Jingxin nodded; he understood these matters well. However, he realized that his entourage couldn’t consist solely of fighters; he also needed a strategist to minimize his speaking. This Mr. Zeng was a trusted aide of the empress, and bringing him along had indeed saved him a lot of trouble.

Han Jingxin sighed, “It’s a pity Mr. Zeng isn’t a strategist. If I ever get the chance to be emperor, I will definitely invite him to be my national advisor. The so-called national protector summoned with great expense is nothing but a fraud—an ornate pillow. Although my father isn’t great at governing, he’s not blind either; he just can’t be bothered to expose them. It’s like keeping a performer around, merely exchanging silver for divine money from the mountains. My father secretly tells me that it’s only a handful of coins each year, and praises my mother for being thrifty. Just look at the other vassal states; their national advisors don’t pull out a few coins from the treasury each year before they start rebelling.”

The skinny monkey among them was already impatient, laughing loudly, “Those who raise ghosts should be killed. As for that rare and valuable fox spirit, leave her to His Highness for proper training. It’s that simple. Besides, we stripped over a dozen sets of armor from the Great Li scouts earlier. Your Highness is generous enough to keep the two most valuable sets instead of selling them all to that cowardly General Zhan. You’ve given one to me and one to our poet friend. We’ll keep them in the armory and, when the time comes, we’ll take out those two men. You can use them to gain credit in the capital. When His Majesty sees them, he will surely be delighted. Those are specially made armors for the Great Li’s accompanying cultivators, and I bet those old bureaucrats in the capital won’t even be able to lift them. I’ve heard those old bones, who have barely any flesh left, still boast of their martial prowess.”

The young man shook his head, “Don’t speak of this in the capital.”

After a brief pause, Han Jingxin self-deprecatingly said, “But I guess it’s no longer a matter of trouble; even if I were to scold them, they wouldn’t have the spirit to denounce me. They’re all too busy looking for a way out. Whether the Shihou Kingdom is surnamed Han or not doesn’t matter much to them. As long as they can continue to hold their positions, it’s all for the benefit of the people, right?”

He glanced southward, “My virtuous brother is truly blessed; he initially wanted to hide away like a turtle, who would have thought that he’d nearly hide himself into becoming a new emperor? Even if he can’t sit on that newly made dragon throne for long, at least he has been an emperor, and how can I not envy that?”

The skinny monkey was already standing on his horse, “Your Highness, you and Mr. Zeng can continue your conversation. Just give me the word—will we kill those two men or not? Rest assured, I’ll ensure that the female ghost is unharmed!”

Han Jingxin laughed, “Go on then. And as for that special armor of the Great Li secret messenger, it won’t be for nothing; we’ll tally both merits later.”

The skinny monkey wiped his mouth and grinned, “Following His Highness is great; there’s meat to eat.”

The skinny monkey was an expert in close combat at the Seventh Stage, possessing a renowned skill that could give even cultivators of the same stage a headache. In the rivers and lakes of the Shihou Kingdom, he truly couldn’t find anyone who could entertain him. He had joined the army after initially being associated with the crown prince, but that bookish prince didn’t recognize talent and had only offered him a hollow position, never providing any real benefits. He then defected to Han Jingxin’s camp, planning to take advantage of the chaos to become a general. The notion of Mr. Zeng being a battlefield hero of ten thousand men particularly appealed to him.

In the world of martial arts, even if one could exterminate a whole family, how many could they actually kill?

On the battlefield, thousands and tens of thousands could clash together; in the heat of battle, even one’s own allies could be mistakenly slain!

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 496: Chatting While Killing

As the sturdy and short martial arts master lightly tapped his toes, he soared into the air.

Han Jingxin turned to the man with the long spear beside him and said, “General Xu, please lend your strength to Hu Han and help him keep things in order. We wouldn’t want him to encounter any mishaps, especially since he’s a practitioner from the mountains. It’s better to be cautious.”

The burly martial general, who wasn’t wearing armor, nodded slightly. He urged his horse forward at a steady pace. Ever since leaving the capital, this young general from the border had not carried any iron armor, only his ancestral spear.

While he didn’t particularly like Han Jingxin’s actions, he didn’t harbor any animosity either. Although Han Jingxin was eccentric, obsessed with women, and had a penchant for unnecessary killings, he was sharp-witted. In contrast, the scholarly Crown Prince, who was a genuinely good person, would have made for a benevolent emperor in peaceful times. However, in times of chaos, his prospects were limited, especially now as the entire Baoping Continent was in turmoil, with not just a few nations in strife, but a full-blown crisis. At such a critical moment, he naturally had to choose the right tree to roost in, even if that tree had already grown crooked.

Once Hu Han and General Xu’s trusted aides departed, Han Jingxin had already shifted his focus away from the battlefield and resumed an idle chat with Mr. Zeng beside him.

They discussed the current chaotic situation in central Baoping Continent.

Han Jingxin jumped from one topic to another, speaking with no real structure.

Yet Mr. Zeng did not show any sign of disdain.

As the thin, monkey-like man leaped off his horse, he didn’t rush toward them but instead floated down to the snow-covered ground, casually strolling toward the three riders.

Ma Duyi couldn’t help but feel a bit tense and whispered, “He’s coming.”

After all, he was a powerful aide next to a prince, and it seemed he was an expert in close combat—a martial arts master below the Earth Immortal level. Once one got close enough, who wouldn’t end up in a fight with a wild brute? This was a shared understanding between the mountain practitioners and the martial artists in the world below. Even though Ma Duyi trusted Mr. Chen beside her, she still felt uneasy. Zeng Ye didn’t dare to breathe too loudly either. He had only heard tales of Mr. Chen’s exploits in the Jianjian Lake area but had never seen them firsthand. Earlier, he could brush off the snowflakes settling on the tall young man, but now he was drenched in sweat, oblivious to the chill of the wind and snow.

Chen Pingan dismounted, shaking off some snowflakes from his shoulders and rolling up his sleeves.

He walked slowly toward the martial arts master, who had defeated all challengers in the world of Jianghu (martial arts community) of the Shih Hao Kingdom, approaching him as if they were long-lost friends reuniting.

Ma Duyi wished her spirit were steadier. The fox fur talismans she wore were both a refuge and a constraint; after all, she had once been a practitioner in the Cave Dwelling realm...

Just the thought that her own skills in the Cave Dwelling realm might not help Mr. Chen in this moment made her feel somewhat despondent.

The heart of a woman is as intricate as winding rivers.

Zeng Ye timidly asked, “Miss Ma, Mr. Chen won’t be in any danger, right?”

Ma Duyi turned to look at the naive, tall young man and replied sharply, “Do you hope there will be danger? And then you can save the day?”

Zeng Ye felt stifled and at a loss for words.

The middle-aged swordsman, sensing the moment, glanced toward the distant battlefield that was about to erupt, and slowly said, “The Dali barbarians have stretched their front too thin. As long as the Zhu Ying Dynasty can hold on for another year, keeping the enemy at bay, and successfully stop the Dali armies led by Su Gaoshan and Cao Ping from pushing into the heartland, then this battle will be winnable. The Dali iron cavalry has been riding the tide for too long; the winds could shift at any moment. Whether the Zhu Ying Dynasty can win this battle hinges not on themselves, but on how long a few vassal states can hold out. If they can sap the momentum of Su Gaoshan and Cao Ping’s forces, then the Dali will have no choice but to withdraw north after raiding the surrounding vassal states of the Zhu Ying Dynasty.”

Han Jingxin joked, “If I didn’t know exactly who Mr. Zeng is, I would suspect you were a lobbyist for the Zhu Ying Dynasty.”

The middle-aged swordsman forced a bitter smile and said, “I’m just a swordsman who knows a bit about lower-tier swordsmanship, a mere Jianghu person, always looked down upon by those sword cultivators from the mountains. When I first traveled to the Zhu Ying Dynasty in my youth, I didn’t even dare to carry my sword out in public. Looking back, that truly was a shameful moment. I should have been wishing for the Zhu Ying Dynasty to trample Dali into the mud instead of urging His Highness to go to the capital of Zhu Ying and lie low for a few years until the situation clarified, then return to the Shih Hao Kingdom to reclaim the land. If it weren’t for the Queen Mother’s trust in me, I wouldn’t even know where I would be making a living.”

Suddenly, Han Jingxin said something completely off-topic, “They say the grand master of Dali has plans that can’t go wrong, but including our Shih Hao Kingdom, several of the Zhu Ying vassals are putting up a fight. It seems the Dali spies have utterly failed in their infiltration of our vassal states. Our Shih Hao Kingdom only has a border army, the Huang family, and they’re the only ones who feel there’s an opportunity and don’t want to be content with being a local overlord at the border, so they decided to take a gamble and joined Su Gaoshan.”

The middle-aged swordsman shook his head and smiled, “There’s no one in this world who can truly plan for everything without fail. There are only those who can accurately predict the situation and ensure that every step aligns with the ebb and flow of circumstances—that is the true path.”

Han Jingxin nodded in admiration, “Mr. Zeng’s insights are profound.”

The middle-aged swordsman suddenly frowned and fell silent, staring at the distant battlefield that was about to ignite, about forty steps away.

Hu Han and the young practitioner in the blue cotton robe had both come to a halt.

Behind Hu Han, General Xu, holding his long spear, also stopped his horse.

Han Jingxin wondered aloud, “Is that young man seeking death? Not only is he not retreating, but he’s also using his celestial techniques to entangle Hu Han, even summoning several powerful life-bound artifacts. Is he trying to show submission? Offering up that fox fur beauty? It seems the gods up in the mountains aren’t any sturdier than the common folk down below. Having such a master, that beautiful demoness surely met with misfortune. Isn’t this the sort of thing a scoundrel like me would do?”

The middle-aged swordsman did not echo Han Jingxin’s final “joke,” his expression growing more serious. “Something doesn’t add up. This person is definitely a practitioner; there’s a flow of spiritual energy (Qi) around him, both large and small. He’s either too weak, only at the lowest level, so his energy is dark and stagnant, or he’s deeply concealed, having reached either the Sea Observation realm or even the Dragon Gate realm, which is why I can’t see through him. If he were a surprising pure martial artist, his intent would be harmoniously natural. However, I’ve been observing the subtle signs of how he dismounted and walked, and while his steps are relatively steady, he lacks that unique ‘intent’ that we martial artists possess... It’s very slack, almost like a novice without a guiding master. Regardless of those possibilities, I can confirm one thing: that young man definitely does not have any intentions of making peace with us.”

Han Jingxin clasped his hands together, rubbing the jade pendant in his palm, and smiled, “Could he be a foolish young bull not afraid of tigers? Used to flaunting his authority in the mountains or around his sect and not realizing how terrifying Hu Han is?”

The middle-aged swordsman shook his head, “Not likely.”

Mr. Zeng quickly changed his stance, shaking his head again. “Not at all.”

Feeling bored, Han Jingxin exhaled repeatedly, releasing large puffs of white mist. “Let’s stop guessing. Whether that guy is a mule or a horse, Hu Han’s punch will make it clear.”

Lowering his voice, Han Jingxin chuckled, “If Hu Han really hits a hard nail, it wouldn’t be a bad thing. Those two rewards I promised might actually make Hu Han genuinely grateful. That’s no easy feat.”

The middle-aged swordsman couldn’t help but chuckle lightly, nodding in agreement.

Han Jingxin’s demeanor revealed a side of his character that others couldn’t help but admire.

This yet-to-be-named prince was already able to manage the untamed Hu Han and the proud General Xu, and it wasn’t merely due to his status.

It would be a strange thing for someone to carry a heavy burden without effort, and Han Jingxin was merely watching the show, while General Xu, who was holding his spear, remained calm within.

Only Hu Han, in the thick of it, grew closer to the young man, initially eager and fidgety, now approaching with a sense of caution. Compared to Mr. Zeng, who was observing from a distance, Hu Han had a more direct perception.

Until both sides halted, merely five steps apart.

Hu Han unexpectedly felt a hint of crisis, yet his smile remained unchanged as he glanced at the bamboo sword and ancient sword hanging at the young man's waist. “Kid, you wouldn’t happen to be a pure martial artist too, would you?”

To which the young man in the blue cotton robe nodded and replied, “Isn’t that a coincidence?”

Hu Han grinned, “What a coincidence! Since we’re both Jianghu people, I can’t help but talk about the rules of Jianghu. Let’s make a deal: you and the boy can leave, but leave that fox fur beauty behind. How about that?”

Chen Pingan smiled and said nothing.

Hu Han shifted his gaze, re-evaluating the depths of the footprints in the snow behind Chen Pingan.

Ordinary people wouldn’t notice the difference, but as a Seventh Realm martial artist, Hu Han had an exceptional eye for detail. He could see the subtle nuances; the young man had walked with varying depths from when he dismounted until now.

Chen Pingan smiled and said, “Don’t keep looking; you won’t uncover the truth. When I traveled alone for the second time, I took a celestial ferry and learned early on how to hide the depth of my steps and the pace of my breathing. One must not harbor ill intentions, but one should always be wary of others. So after practicing my punches more and more, it became second nature. Sometimes I might not even notice.”

Hu Han was taken aback and clicked his tongue. “Little brother, you really are a master!”

Chen Pingan neither confirmed nor denied it. “Are you a Body of Gold martial artist? But your foundation is so poor, it’s almost like paper.”

Hu Han laughed heartily. “Little brother, that’s quite hurtful! Be careful; if I’m displeased, I might just rip your tongue right out.”

Chen Pingan nodded, “My fault. Recently, I’ve been dealing too much with the dead, and I’ve gotten used to talking more. I actually didn’t use to be like this when facing opponents.”

Hu Han realized, “No wonder! No worries, no worries. As a senior in Jianghu, I happen to be quite the opposite. I love chatting while…”

“While killing!” 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 497: Joining Forces

The snow crunched beneath Hu Han's feet as he unleashed a powerful punch aimed at Chen Ping'an's abdomen. 

With his sleeves rolled up, Chen Ping'an casually raised one hand behind him while the other gently pressed against Hu Han's fist. The moment their hands met, he used the force to glide back, effortlessly drifting four or five steps away. 

Hu Han's punch missed its target, but he quickly followed, throwing another strike like a comet streaking across the sky. The snowstorm swirling around the short man was swept aside by the sheer force of his fists. 

Chen Ping'an braced himself with his elbow against Hu Han's punch, sliding back a few steps before taking two small steps toward his mount. 

Hu Han believed he had gauged the true strength of this enigmatic young man. He planned to stop holding back and take decisive action. However, Chen Ping'an's elbow not only blocked his punch but also unleashed a sudden surge of power that sent a shockwave through Hu Han. Alarmed, he quickly suppressed the pure vital energy (Zhenqi) within him and retreated a few steps. Even in retreat, as a master in the Golden Body stage, he moved with the grace of flowing water, showing no signs of defeat. 

Once he stopped, Hu Han wore an expression of astonished enlightenment. "Well, well! You put on quite the show! You even managed to fool me once!" 

It turned out that the young man's seemingly aggressive strikes were mere feints, akin to a child lifting a hammer with all their might, only to pause just before it hit the ground. The hammer hung suspended in the air, and the child found it surprisingly effortless when lifting it again. 

Perhaps Hu Han could have pressed forward, closing the distance and delivering a decisive blow to this young man. But deep down, he understood that it was more likely that the other party had something planned—perhaps that hidden hand behind Chen Ping'an's back. 

The way the young man wielded his fist was clearly no novice's work. Even if his cultivation wasn't high, one could tell he had likely received guidance from a master, or had experienced life-and-death battles that sharpened his skills. 

Chen Ping'an shook his wrist, looking unfazed. "Don’t get me wrong. That martial lunatic might be at a higher level, but in terms of martial arts, he’s not as good as a certain smiling fellow I met years ago. He was purely a martial man like you, but lacked true intent behind his punches, relying on evasive maneuvers instead." 

Hu Han's expression shifted between uncertainty and contemplation. 

It wasn't that this top martial artist of the Stone Hair Kingdom had started to feel intimidated after just a few exchanges—such a notion was out of the question. Rather, it was the hidden hand behind Chen Ping'an and the sword at his waist that made him uneasy. 

This was a primal instinct honed through countless life-or-death situations. 

That was the real issue. 

As for the insults about his "insufficient foundation" and "paper-thin Golden Body," Hu Han paid them no mind. 

"As long as your palms are in sync, you can control it freely. Practicing martial arts also requires honing the heart, the importance of which is not inferior to that of a cultivator. Below the intent of the fist lies the form itself, and only after mastering the form can one learn the techniques of combat. A Golden Body like yours, if tossed into some corner, wouldn’t last a few days, becoming nothing more than a sharpening stone for the local martial artists." 

Chen Ping'an smiled. "Alright, enough chit-chat. I already know your depth." 

Hu Han, with one hand behind his back, raised the other and flicked his fingers playfully, his demeanor lighthearted. "In the spirit of reciprocity, why don’t you take the first strike this time? I wouldn’t want you to think I’m bullying the younger generation and lacking the grace of an elder." 

In a close-quarters brawl, the moniker "Iron Smith" certainly favored Hu Han. 

Hearing Chen Ping'an’s remark about "palms in sync and control," Ma Duyi almost burst out laughing. At first, she thought it was just Chen's casual boasting, but suddenly she restrained her expression, watching his figure. Could it be that knowledge and martial intent were truly interconnected? 

Were it anyone else, Ma Duyi would have dismissed such a bizarre thought. But with Chen Ping'an, she felt that the impossible might just become possible. 

Who else would sit quietly at the entrance of that house on Qingxia Island? 

Who would really leave Book Lake for this journey? 

Chen Ping'an stepped forward. 

His demeanor remained nonchalant, showing no signs of a master. Compared to Hu Han’s every strike that cracked the air and shattered the surrounding snowflakes, Chen Ping'an seemed like a whisper against the roaring wind. 

Hu Han began to discern the underlying flavors of this encounter. 

This young man, who concealed his true capability, must have been heavily injured, causing each of his strikes to appear as if he were a mere accountant, calculating every small profit with utmost care. 

The bravado of a pure martial artist was nowhere to be found! 

With murderous intent boiling within him, Hu Han finally let go of restraint. 

In an instant, Hu Han’s instincts told him not to allow that man to throw another punch. However, the principles of martial arts and his street wisdom told him that once they were in close combat, if he didn’t hold back, the other party would surely meet their end. 

A flicker of uncertainty lingered. 

A punch was thrown. 

Hu Han received the blow, laughing heartily. "That tickles like a little girl’s touch..." 

But soon, Hu Han couldn't laugh anymore. 

The punches kept coming, each one landing with force like a waterfall cascading from great heights. 

Hu Han responded with punch after punch, their figures weaving through the blizzarding snow. 

Even if Chen Ping'an was but a "paper-thin Golden Body," he still commanded respect as a martial artist of the highest order! 

After seven or eight punches, Hu Han felt a light sheen of sweat on his forehead. 

After eleven punches, he was drenched in sweat, and blood began to trickle from the corner of his mouth. 

Yet the young man’s strikes only grew faster and more relentless, showing no signs of fatigue or intent to stop. 

Frustrated, Hu Han, a formidable warrior of the seventh stage, decided to abandon his thoughts of counterattacking. He let his vital energy circulate through his meridians, protecting his key acupoints, allowing the young man to keep throwing punches. The intent of his fists could endure, but every martial artist's pure vital energy had its limits. Eventually, that would be the best moment for Hu Han to counterattack. 

But then he heard a voice from behind, "General Xu! Quickly assist Hu Han in breaking this man's fist intent!" 

Xu, the martial general, frowned but showed no hesitation as he spurred his horse forward. 

He was known as the foremost cavalry expert of the Stone Hair Kingdom, and seated upon his steed, wielding a long spear, his combat prowess was exceptional, far beyond that of an ordinary warrior. 

Hu Han had previously been willing to stand alongside him and share a laugh, but now the truth of their martial prowess was laid bare. 

As for the widely-known "Poet with a Spear," it all stemmed from his first visit to the emperor. He had been granted special permission to bring his spear into the palace, and before the court, he had to ride a wild horse while writing a famed poem on a stone tablet, all without stopping his horse. Failure would see him stripped of his ancestral spear and banished from the military. Success would bring him great reward, elevating him to the rank of a fourth-grade martial official. 

In the end, he became famous overnight, known throughout the kingdom. 

After gently placing his spear down, he knelt and bowed, thanking the emperor for the favor. 

At that time, the young general trembled, his voice filled with emotion. 

Everyone saw this fortunate young man as overwhelmed with gratitude. 

The emperor was pleased and personally conferred upon him the title of "Poet with a Spear." 

Yet for years, he had harbored resentment, viewing it as a great humiliation! 

Four generations of ancestors had wielded a spear soaked in the blood of countless enemies. Handed down from father to son, it had now fallen into his hands, reduced to a mere tool for delicate needlework! 

Xu Mao, a lineage of loyalty and valor, had for generations boldly faced death on the battlefield, never receiving applause or accolades. He was no performer seeking superficial fame! 

In the heat of battle, he charged forth like the force of an earthquake. 

Though Chen Ping'an and Hu Han were entangled, Xu Mao's spear was still aimed directly at Chen Ping'an's neck after he threw his twelfth punch. 

Chen Ping'an, sensing the danger, chose not to force out another punch in a show of bravado. 

This was all anticipated. 

Whether it was the cavalry wielding the spear or the middle-aged swordsman, it was clear that help was on the way. 

Chen Ping'an simply used one hand to push Hu Han, who had yet to suffer a fatal blow, back to a safe distance, positioning himself just right to intercept the spear's trajectory. 

Xu Mao's wrist twisted slightly, nearly skewering Hu Han with the spear, but it narrowly missed, slipping past under Hu Han's arm. 

Chen Ping'an stomped his foot down hard. 

The ground shook, and within a radius of several meters, snow erupted into the air. 

Xu Mao almost immediately shut his eyes. 

When he opened them again, his spear was raised high, piercing forward. 

The spear dipped. 

A flash of blue dashed down the length of the spear, kneeing Xu Mao and sending him tumbling off his horse. 

Yet Xu Mao clung tightly to the spear, refusing to let go, spitting out blood as he stood up, only to find the figure had taken a position atop his mount, not pursuing further. 

Xu Mao glared at the retreating Hu Han, rage boiling over. "Hu Han! I saved you from your predicament, and yet you stand aside, deliberately sabotaging me?!" 

Chen Ping'an didn’t look at Xu Mao but instead turned his gaze toward Han Jingxin and the middle-aged swordsman, smiling. "I advise you not to rely on him anymore. A paper-thin Golden Body who’s already scared out of his wits is unreliable." 

Han Jingxin's expression turned serious. Had both Xu Mao and Hu Han been defeated? Losing twice in a row was not frightening, but if that young man struck a vital blow, Xu Mao's gap with Hu Han would only widen. If Hu Han truly lost his warrior's courage, how could they continue battling? Would they have to rely on this Mr. Zeng at their side? 

In truth, Hu Han was more dependable than Xu Mao, but Han Jingxin had his own calculations. Mr. Zeng should either decisively strike down that young man or refrain from intervening to protect himself. 

If Mr. Zeng did not act, even in dire straits, there would still be room for maneuver. But if he acted and failed, would he then have to apologize? That would only be possible if the other party was willing to mend the relationship. 

It was said that certain stubborn mountain cultivators, when provoked, could become utterly ruthless in pursuit of their grand ideals, forsaking all familial ties. 

Mr. Zeng spoke softly, "Your Highness, if I don’t act, morale will falter, and we’ll be at the mercy of others. If I do intervene, there’s a chance for Hu Han and Xu Mao to join forces with me to besiege this man. However, there’s a prerequisite: I cannot be defeated in one move." 

Han Jingxin forced a smile. "Mr. Zeng, surely you jest." 

Xu Mao retreated to the cavalry and mounted a fresh steed, his face a mask of suppressed fury. 

Hu Han also considered retreating, but just as he was about to move, the young man turned his gaze towards him. 

It seemed Hu Han was genuinely frightened, remaining rooted in place. 

Chen Ping'an, on the other hand, felt that neither Hu Han nor Xu Mao were as simple as they appeared. 

The situation was delicate, with everyone hiding their strengths, all reluctant to give their all. 

It seemed the morale of Han Jingxin’s cavalry was quite intriguing. 

The middle-aged swordsman, who had hardly drawn his sword, slowly rode out. 

The two riders were now separated by more than thirty paces. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 498: What a Coincidence, I’m Also a Swordsman

Chen Ping’an, who had been standing on horseback the entire time, asked, “You’re not a swordsman, but a swordmaster, right?”

The middle-aged swordsman shook his head. “I can’t accept such a title. My surname is Zeng, and I’m just a wandering swordsman. Wherever there’s food, that’s where I go to earn my keep.”

The man chuckled. “It seems we won’t be talking about righteousness anymore.”

Chen Ping’an casually placed one hand behind his back and opened his palm with the other. “Suit yourself.”

The swordsman turned to Hu Han. “I sincerely request that we, along with General Xu, set aside our grievances, join forces, and fight together against our enemies.”

Chen Ping’an smiled. “Since Senior Zeng is also a pure martial artist, you should see for yourself. Your warrior here, in the Golden Body realm, stands out like a crane among chickens. A true martial artist fights for their breath, striving to elevate their own realm. They face opponents who are even a realm higher without fear, accepting whatever fate may come. Yet this one prefers to lower himself a level to engage in battle. The martial world of your Shihau Kingdom is truly amusing. If it weren’t for the fact that this person happens to be the leader of Shihau’s martial world, I’d wager that as long as he’s alive, the entire Shihau Kingdom’s martial world will be dragged down by him.”

Xu Mao smirked, seemingly approving of this remark. 

However, this didn’t prevent him from slowly advancing with his spear in hand. 

Hu Han appeared thoughtful. 

Unexpectedly, Chen Ping’an turned and said, “Have you come to your senses? What a pity that you cannot achieve it.”

Hu Han stretched his neck. “Oh? Is that so?”

In an instant, Hu Han’s demeanor shifted completely, as if this was the real Hu Han—the one who had once taught the heroes of the Shihau Kingdom to bow their heads.

Hu Han declared loudly, “Mr. Zeng, General Xu, I’ll take the lead! You just need to provide support!”

Chen Ping’an paid Hu Han’s words no mind while ignoring Xu Mao’s advance.

In the midst of the swirling wind and snow, Chen Ping’an’s gaze was solely on the middle-aged swordsman carrying the long sword. 

Without any visible motion from the man, the long sword on his back unsheathed itself, shooting straight up into the sky, vanishing in an instant. 

This was a swordmaster’s signature skill: Sword Control Technique. 

It was also the main reason why mountain-dwelling sword cultivators looked down upon swordmasters from the valleys. 

Chen Ping’an pressed his left hand against the hilt of the large imitation Huanggu sword. “What a coincidence, I’m also a swordsman.” 

He slowly pushed the sword out of its sheath by an inch. 

The mountain’s presence. 

It was hard to tell whether it was the intent of the fist or the intent of the sword. 

Xu Mao squinted instinctively, feeling a bit dazzled. 

Yet, surprisingly, Xu Mao was the first to strike. 

The warhorse galloped forward, spear in hand. 

Hu Han followed suit, leaping toward Chen Ping’an. 

The middle-aged swordsman smiled effortlessly. 

The ancient sword with a hilt made of white jade and spiritual mushrooms remained elusive. 

Chen Ping’an took a large step forward on horseback, then stepped into the void, vanishing from sight. 

Just as Hu Han leapt over the horse’s back, he landed on the road ahead. 

In the next moment, the figure dressed in blue appeared next to Xu Mao, nudging him, sending both Xu Mao and his horse flying sideways. 

Xu Mao left his steed mid-air but landed firmly on the ground, while his unfortunate mount crashed heavily into the snow a dozen yards away, dying instantly. 

However, an even stranger occurrence followed. Just like Chen Ping’an’s inexplicable vanishing act, the middle-aged swordsman also disappeared silently. 

Not only that, but he abandoned his sword sheath, which fell from his back and embedded itself at an angle into the snow. 

Chen Ping’an remained on horseback, furrowing his brows in silence. 

He gently pushed the large Huanggu sword back into its sheath. 

Looking down at the empty sheath, he recalled the fleeting glimpse of the sword earlier. Hu Han and Xu Mao, who had their attention on him, failed to notice that the sheath was real, but what it contained was not a long sword but rather resembled a straight blade. 

Chen Ping’an felt a bit helpless, murmuring, “Could it be that I’ve stumbled upon a sword merchant by chance?” 

The sword sheath remained. 

The person had fled, and that straight blade should have been taken along as well. 

Everything felt peculiar. 

What “Mr. Zeng” had said about Chen Ping’an earlier had now come back to him. 

Things that were hard to comprehend should be set aside for the moment, while he focused on what he could grasp. 

For example, Chen Ping’an used his sword control technique to pull the sword sheath from the snow, flicking it with his sleeve. 

The sword sheath zipped through the air like a flying sword. 

It pierced through the neck of the prince of Shihau. 

After confirming there were no death talismans or similar celestial techniques at play, Chen Ping’an chose not to look at the corpse that slid lifelessly off its horse. 

He turned around, his gaze shifting between Xu Mao and Hu Han. 

Xu Mao remained motionless, gripping his spear tightly. 

Hu Han had already taken off running. 

Chen Ping’an pursued after him. 

The two figures soon vanished from sight before everyone present. 

All the elite cavalrymen exchanged glances, awaiting Xu Mao’s command. 

Since the sky was falling, someone had to step forward. 

About half a stick of incense later, a familiar blue figure returned, holding something in hand. 

Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye were nearly going insane. 

It turned out Xu Mao, in a frenzy after Chen Ping’an’s departure, gathered a few elite guards from the royal household and then suddenly launched an attack. He slaughtered all forty-odd cavalrymen one by one, and finally squatted down to sever the head of Prince Han Jingxin, hanging it at his waist, while he saddled three warhorses, riding one and using the other two as replacements for a long-distance ride to avoid exhausting the horses. 

Xu Mao did not leave immediately. 

Instead, he quietly sat on horseback, waiting for Chen Ping’an’s return. 

When Chen Ping’an approached Xu Mao, he tossed the head of Hu Han to the martial general on horseback and asked, “What now?” 

Xu Mao received the head, hanging it by his saddle, and smiled. “You must have guessed, right? The future emperor of Shihau is dead, and as the protector of my lord, I’m now a sinner doomed to die. What else can I do but seek refuge with the Great Li’s Su Gaoshan?” 

Chen Ping’an felt no surprise. 

Xu Mao inquired, “Aren’t you going to kill me?” 

Chen Ping’an shook his head. “You’ve already helped me clean up this mess, so why would I kill you? That would just create more trouble for myself.” 

Xu Mao glanced at the young man, whose face remained pale, and chuckled. “I hope we won’t cross paths again in the future.” 

Chen Ping’an nodded. “That would be best.” 

Xu Mao turned his horse’s head and rode away through the wind and snow. 

Chen Ping’an crouched down, scooping up some snow in his hands to wipe his face. 

Surrounding him were not only the numerous corpses but also the warhorses that lingered, gently nudging their fallen masters. 

As he released his hands, the blood stained the snow, scattering on the ground. 

As Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye rushed over, about to speak, Chen Ping’an waved his hand, signaling them to hold off for now. 

He leaped onto a warhorse and gazed in a direction somewhat askew from where Xu Mao had departed. 

Moments later, Chen Ping’an finally sat on horseback, wiping away the blood that had suddenly flowed from his ears and nose. 

After killing Hu Han and taking the specially formulated ointment from the Yang family shop, he felt no pain throughout his body, but covering up the gruesome scene remained troublesome. 

Otherwise, someone like Xu Mao might just launch a surprise counterattack. 

In fact, Xu Mao did have such a plan. 

However, after Chen Ping’an sensed it, he decisively abandoned the idea and retreated completely. 

Killing Xu Mao wasn’t difficult, but if he did, Chen Ping’an would have to bear the burden of this mess alone, leading to unending troubles as he headed north afterward. 

The reason Chen Ping’an had never used his two flying swords, nor took out that semi-immortal weapon, was that even for a pure martial artist, killing royal relatives, even an emperor, didn’t necessarily break the rules of the mountain. This was because martial artists were never really mountain-dwellers; that title belonged to those who practiced Qi. Among those, sword cultivators were naturally even more so. Furthermore, Chen Ping’an wanted to have a real fight, a sentiment inspired by the ghostly General Wei he had encountered at the Lingguan Temple. 

It felt as though... it wasn’t particularly effective. 

Ma Duyi understood the significance of Chen Ping’an’s actions better than Zeng Ye did. 

She had never felt so unnerved. 

Inside Shihau Kingdom, how could it be any less scheming than the intrigues at Shujian Lake? 

Chen Ping’an rasped, “This place isn’t suitable for us to linger. We should at least leave a hundred miles and find a secluded spot to avoid the wind and snow.” 

The three riders continued on their way. 

Chen Ping’an had to don the golden robe of the Divine Liquor to cover up the grim state he was in, outside of his cotton cloak. 

Xu Mao had long gone, but as this Shihau Kingdom warrior prepared to seek refuge with the Great Li cavalry, he suddenly stopped his horse and spoke solemnly. “Mr. Zeng?”

The middle-aged “swordsman” truly emerged from the snowstorm in the distance, walking up to Xu Mao and smiling. “General Xu, you can return the long spear passed down from your ancestors. I believe there’s a saying in your family’s teachings that you’ve pondered over for years without understanding. However, if possible, I would like to borrow a horse from you. You may keep this long spear, inscribed with the words ‘Wind and Snow.’ Someday, even if I don’t come to retrieve it myself, someone will come looking for the Great Li patrol envoy, Xu Mao. What do you say?” 

Xu Mao nodded, his eyes ablaze with excitement. “Alright!” 

The man took a horse and gradually walked away. 

This man, whose identity, long sword, name, and background seemed entirely fabricated, led the horse away, and as if sensing something, he smiled slightly. “My heart is unhurried, and my body is unbound. What is the cause of the inner turmoil, unable to find release?” 

He turned his head towards Chen Ping’an’s direction, lamenting, “It’s a pity that the slots are limited, so I cannot do business with you. What a shame, it would probably be a good deal, better than just becoming a Great Li patrol envoy.” 

The speed of the three riders varied, depending on Chen Ping’an’s injuries. 

However, in Ma Duyi’s eyes, although Chen Ping’an was injured, he seemed unchanged in spirit. 

Chen Ping’an suddenly asked, “In winter, when the snow is dense, there’s a sound like shattered jade. Have you heard this phrase before?” 

Ma Duyi nodded. “I’ve heard it.” 

Chen Ping’an replied, “Indeed, you’re well-versed, not wasting such a good name.” 

Ma Duyi stifled a laugh. “I just heard it earlier.” 

Chen Ping’an was taken aback and then laughed. “This joke is like this wind and snow.” 

Ma Duyi looked somewhat puzzled. 

She began to ponder the deeper meaning behind those words. 

Zeng Ye spoke up, “Mr. Chen must mean that Miss Ma’s joke is rather cold and biting.” 

Ma Duyi cast a doubtful glance at Chen Ping’an. 

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “Do you trust Zeng Ye’s words?” 

Ma Duyi thought for a moment, and then agreed, giving Zeng Ye a fierce glare. 

Zeng Ye looked somewhat aggrieved. 

Ma Duyi hesitated for a long time but still didn’t dare to speak. 

Chen Ping’an said, “You were wondering if we should gather the souls of those cavalrymen?” 

Ma Duyi felt a bit guilty. “I think it’s completely unnecessary, but…” 

Chen Ping’an smiled, “But you feel that I’m the type who doesn’t think clearly and always likes to do strange things, right?” 

Saying such things out loud meant they were no longer weighing on the mind. 

That was a good thing. 

Ma Duyi felt much better and smiled. 

Chen Ping’an continued, “Actually, as long as you grasp the beginning and end, even if the situation is a tangled mess for now, there’s no need to fear. Just take it slowly.” 

Ma Duyi, with her competitive spirit resurfacing, replied, “Then why did you say we should hurry a hundred miles away? Why not take it slow?” 

Chen Ping’an took out a secret medicinal pill from the Water Palace, took a sip of wine, and swallowed it with a sense of helplessness, choosing not to argue. 

Ma Duyi began to laugh to herself. 

Zeng Ye shook his head, thinking women were indeed something else. 

The three riders galloped through the wind and snow. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 499: Riding Up the Hill (Part 1)

Through the wind and snow, three riders journeyed deep into the heart of the Stone Hair Kingdom (Shiháo Guó).

The once-grand cities, fiercely contested by military forces, lay in ruins, while the rural areas had managed to escape the ravages of war, for the most part. However, with refugees fleeing in all directions, leaving their homes behind, the arrival of three heavy snowfalls this winter had compounded their misery. Along the official roads, the sight of emaciated corpses—young men, women, and children—was all too common.

Ma Duyi, kind-hearted and not truly like a proper disciple of the Book of Letters Lake (Shujiàn Hú), felt a deep sense of empathy for the suffering around him. So, when Chen Ping'an proposed that they use their funds to set up a porridge kitchen and a medicine shop to help the local people, both Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye were particularly pleased.

Chen Ping'an took out the jade tablet he had received from Qingxia Island, hanging it on the other side of his waist beside his sword. He sought out the local government, while Ma Duyi, wearing a wide-brimmed hat to obscure his features, bundled himself in a thick cotton coat, even concealing the elegant figure of the woman dressed in fox fur beside him.

They had traveled through numerous counties, and as they approached the central regions of the Stone Hair Kingdom, the number of dead only increased. The signs of a military presence became more apparent, with some being remnants of the defeated troops retreating south, while others, clad in shiny new armor, looked well-prepared for battle. Zeng Ye speculated that these soldiers heading north might stand a chance against the cavalry of the Great Li (Dà Lì).

Yet, Chen Ping'an understood the grim reality: once battles broke out, these soldiers—equipped with newly issued armor and weapons that had been stored away for years—would perish quickly. Only a handful of the fortunate would transition from being "new recruits who didn’t even know how they died" to "veterans who learned how to survive."

In the long river of time at the Lotus Flower Blessed Land (Ōuhuā Fúdì), Chen Ping'an had witnessed many brutal battles that decided the fates of the four kingdoms.

In the Vast Tranquil Realm (Hàorán Tiānxià), he had also seen the formidable appearances of the scouts from the southern border of the Great Li. It was easy to understand why they were known as the "Strong Young Men of the Hill”—because they were the battle-hardened veterans who had survived amidst the piles of corpses. A twenty-year-old border soldier from the Great Li might have seen and fought in more battles, witnessing more death, than some forty- or fifty-year-old generals from the Stone Hair Kingdom.

Chen Ping'an thought even further. As a vassal of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, the Stone Hair Kingdom had many figures like the prince Han Jingxin, who had died at his own hands. Many dared to confront scouts from the Great Li, who traveled with two accompanying cultivators. The northern border army, composed of soldiers born from the shadows, had been utterly wiped out. Yet, the emperor of the Stone Hair Kingdom still desperately summoned troops from the border regions, determined to block the advancing Great Li forces. Even now, with the capital besieged, they were resolved to hold their ground.

Why would the Stone Hair Kingdom act so desperately, willing to sacrifice so many lives just to slightly impede the advance of Su Gaoshan’s cavalry?

Scholars wrote in their books that winter demanded heavy snow, echoing with the sound of shattered jade.

Chen Ping'an looked up and saw the road blanketed in snow, the mountains cloaked in white, as if the heavens had pressed down a heavy burden upon the world.

He sighed, recalling the clanging sound of iron armor from that night in the Spirit Official Temple, and felt a bit more at ease.

As they traveled north, Ma Duyi coped better than most. Having been a registry master and a true practitioner of the Book of Letters Lake, he naturally felt sorrow for the suffering he witnessed but wasn’t overly shocked. However, with each passing day, as they encountered scenes reminiscent of hell on earth, even Zeng Ye, who had initially cried silently, began to feel numb.

During this time, Zeng Ye had been possessed multiple times by male spirits, helping some fulfill their last wishes, while others left with regrets. His homeland had long since changed beyond recognition.

Meanwhile, the female spirits who had taken residence in the fox-fur and talisman beauty departed one by one, like Su Xinzai. New female spirits continued to traverse the mortal realm through talismans, each talisman akin to an inn or ferry, with bittersweet reunions and sorrowful farewells, each acting upon their own choices, revealing truths or veiling them.

On this day, Chen Ping'an led Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye to visit the governor’s mansion, where they were received without hindrance.

The local governor was a portly old man whose eyes were barely visible. He was known for his tendency to smile at everyone, and when he did, it only obscured his eyes further.

The past year had been anything but peaceful for the old man, with chaos reigning. Aside from hiring a cultivator from the nearest仙家洞府 (Xianjia Dongfu) at great expense for protection, he had also enlisted two mysterious practitioners—considered beneath him—who were nothing more than wild cultivators from the Lower Five Realms. One of them, a registry master, was on the verge of leaving in anger, but after the governor promised to increase his monthly salary by three snowflake coins, he reluctantly stayed, realizing that this was a true cultivator not to be compared with the wild ones. 

Upon Chen Ping'an's arrival, the old governor immediately felt that the extra expenditure of three snowflake coins was worth it. The registry master, after all, recognized the invaluable jade tablet from Qingxia Island at first glance—he was practically trembling and nearly prostrated himself before the young cultivator from the Book of Letters Lake.

With that, everything fell into place. The young man named Chen, who had come to pay his respects, proposed to open porridge and medicine shops within the county to aid the common people. He would provide the funds, but he needed the local government to provide manpower. At that moment, both Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye finally saw the governor’s eyes widen in disbelief.

They must have thought it absurd that a benevolent figure from the Book of Letters Lake would be akin to a great demon claiming to be a celestial master.

The two wild cultivators, who appeared respectful and timid, exchanged glances but remained silent.

Then, to everyone’s surprise, the young man named Chen summoned officials skilled in household registration, taxation, and commercial matters to sit down with them, carefully discussing details such as current rice and medicine prices, the amount stored in government granaries, and the rough number of local impoverished citizens and refugees. They deliberated over the locations for the porridge and medicine shops and how many officials could be spared without affecting their duties. Each aspect was scrutinized, making the seasoned officials feel as if they were facing a great challenge.

After the meeting concluded, the governor’s office immediately began working late into the night, with officials scattering to carry out the plans.

Chen Ping'an and his companions stayed in the governor's courtyard. Later that night, the two wild cultivators secretly approached, showing no fear of the young man from Qingxia Island. In stark contrast to their earlier deference, one of them, rubbing his thumb, inquired with a grin whether they should be discussing a hush money fee. As for what "Chen the Benefactor" was truly after from this county—whether it was people, riches, or magical artifacts—they did not care.

At that moment, Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye were still in Chen Ping'an's room, enjoying a rare moment of idle chatter.

Even someone as dull as Zeng Ye found it hard to comprehend that Chen had been steadily working toward his goals. Despite the various challenges and failures along the way, and even though some small wishes remained unfulfilled, many of the spirits that had manifested in the Stone Hair Kingdom, like Miss Su, had departed with fewer regrets.

Logically, Chen Ping'an's state of mind should have been becoming lighter. 

But it was quite the opposite.

Thus, Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye would sit with him quietly, making sure not to disturb his thoughts. Most of their conversation revolved around trivial matters, and while Chen might not have expressed much verbally, he never found their chatter tiresome. Occasionally, when he overheard them bickering over insignificant matters or engaging in light-hearted nonsense, he would chuckle, leaving Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye puzzled as to why some of their unfunny remarks amused him more than their genuinely funny ones.

Right now, one of the men and the ghostly figure sitting at the small fire stove, snacking on melon seeds, found the two wild cultivators' antics particularly entertaining.

Ma Duyi's eyes sparkled with curiosity about how the accountant would respond.

Chen Ping'an asked with a smile, “So, how much hush money do you think is fair?”

One of the wild cultivators, with a plan already in mind, replied, “If little brother could forge a tablet like the one from Qingxia Island and even deceive a registry master, it must be quite a significant endeavor. Just for tonight's opening of the porridge and medicine shops, you've already spent a fair amount of gold. So, hush money should be... around forty or fifty snowflake coins? What do you think, little brother? Are you willing to part with a bit of cash to ensure you can make a fortune later?”

Chen Ping'an placed his hands on their shoulders, “Since you two have seen through me, I might just have to eliminate you both. Why bother with hush money? If you take the coins and, when you return, decide to squeeze for more, not only will it become troublesome, but you might also jeopardize my plans. It would be better to take a more straightforward approach. What do you think?”

The two wild cultivators were greatly alarmed; being held by the shoulders disrupted their qi, causing their spiritual energy to stagnate.

Before they could plead for mercy, Chen Ping'an, with a stern face, said, “I have grand plans ahead. You two might be able to lend a small hand, but to leave this county alive, you’ll need to cough up some life-saving cash. Though you’re merely practitioners of the Lower Five Realms, you should have around... forty-five snowflake coins?”

The two wild cultivators, already not wealthy, felt as if they had lost their parents. They managed to scrape together thirty-two snowflake coins, claiming they had nothing left.

Chen Ping'an took the coins, waved his hand, “Return home and keep a low profile. Wait for my news. If you know your place, once things settle down, I’ll share some leftovers with you. But if you have any ulterior motives, I’ll strip away everything from you that holds value, and you’ll regret ever stepping into this governor’s office.”

The two, finally relieved to have escaped without being robbed, felt an unexpected sense of fortune. Could it be that they would benefit from this disaster? After discussing, they felt it was a bit precarious, but they didn’t dare sneak away, holding on tightly to the thirty-something hard-earned coins, experiencing a moment of anxiety and relief.

Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye laughed heartily.

Chen Ping'an was seated at the table, “When we leave the county, we’ll return the snowflake coins to them.”

Then he turned to Zeng Ye, “As we travel further north, there may still be opportunities to open porridge and medicine shops, but we’ll take it one step at a time based on the situation. Don’t worry about it; I have my plans. However, for the next porridge and medicine shop, Zeng Ye, you will be in charge of dealing with the local officials. You need not worry about making mistakes or spending too much; those are not things to fret over. I may not get involved in the details, but I’ll be watching over you.”

Zeng Ye nodded vigorously, wanting to say something but hesitating.

Chen Ping'an encouraged him, “Every beginning is difficult, but it must begin somewhere.”

Zeng Ye stopped speaking, feeling both apprehensive and excited. 

It seemed that, compared to cultivating, this endeavor brought him more comfort.

Chen Ping'an added, “If you ever feel tired or bored, don’t hesitate to let me know. After all, your primary focus should still be on your cultivation.”

Zeng Ye nodded eagerly, “Don’t worry, Mr. Chen, I won’t delay my training.”

Chen Ping'an smiled knowingly.

In truth, the young man would likely become even more diligent and focused.

Soon, the porridge and medicine shops were established smoothly in the county. With the local government experienced in similar matters and the governor personally overseeing the operations, the young man in a cotton coat became a figure of awe, shrouded in mystery.

Three days later, Chen Ping'an had Ma Duyi quietly place those thirty-two snowflake coins in the rooms of the two wild cultivators.

Then the three riders made their way to a porridge shop near the city gate, stopping at a distance. After dismounting, Chen Ping'an entrusted the registry master, who had accompanied them, to watch over their horses for a moment.

At the porridge shop, Ma Duyi was reluctant to play the "beggar," while Zeng Ye didn’t feel the need for a bowl of bland porridge. So, Chen Ping'an went alone, patiently waiting in line for a bowl that was somewhat thicker than “water-like” porridge, along with two steamed buns. He squatted by the roadside, eating the buns with the porridge while hearing officials loudly announcing the rules to the local impoverished citizens and the refugees. They were warned not to be greedy, as the porridge was to be distributed per head, and one should eat slowly; hurrying would lead to mistakes.

As Chen Ping'an observed the long lines, he noticed several sturdy local young men, some with their children, munching on candied hawthorns in hand.

Nearby, a group of local men, not too gaunt, complained as they ate and drank, lamenting that even pig food was better.

Chen Ping'an quietly savored his food, his mind as calm as still water, knowing well that in this world, things given for free were rarely valued. If one spent money, even if it was the same porridge and buns, they might taste better, and at the very least, one wouldn’t complain.

After finishing his bowl of porridge, Chen Ping'an returned to Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye, saying, “Let’s go.”

The three riders left the city.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 500: Riding Up the Hill (Part 2)

Ma Duyi had always been perceptive, and after spending several days with Zeng Ye wandering around porridge shops and pharmacies, he had picked up on some troubling signs. Once they were out of the city, he could no longer hold back his complaints. “Mr. Chen, at least thirty percent of the silver we’ve invested has gone right into the pockets of those bureaucrats at the yamen. I can see it clearly, but why can’t you? Why don’t you give that old county magistrate a good scolding?”

Chen Pingan merely replied, “Oh, is that so?”

Ma Duyi was nearly livid. 

Zeng Ye, on the other hand, looked utterly astonished. The young man had no idea about the intricacies of the bureaucratic world.

Seeing that the accountant had fallen silent, Ma Duyi’s frustration only grew. “Mr. Chen! If you keep this up, I won’t help anymore! Just let that foolish Zeng Ye handle it himself and see if he can actually help you!”

Chen Pingan thought for a moment and offered a rather vague explanation. “Since we’re doing a good deed and it’s mostly done, there's no need to be overly critical. I was prepared for a thirty percent loss to begin with. In fact, my bottom line is even lower. If those officials pocket forty percent, I can accept that too. Whether it's thirty or forty percent, let’s just consider it their reward for doing a good deed.”

Ma Duyi couldn’t believe his ears. He wanted to be angry but found it hard to muster the energy, so he simply fell silent.

Chen Pingan smiled and said, “If it bothers you, as long as you’re willing to help Zeng Ye, I can lower my bottom line from forty to thirty percent. How about that?”

At this, Ma Duyi felt satisfied and began to ride a little closer to Zeng Ye, patiently explaining various insights and tips to the young, wooden-faced boy.

Suddenly, Chen Pingan slowed his horse and took out a small, elongated wooden box from his sleeve. Its bronze inscriptions were archaic, a gift from Tan Yuanyi of Grain Island, serving as a token of friendship among the three. It was a rather rare item—an exquisite little sword stand, only a finger long, compact and easy to carry, designed to hold a message-sending flying sword. However, it lacked the versatility of a larger sword room and could only store one flying sword at a time. The spiritual energy required to nurture the sword was much greater than that of a sword room, but even so, as long as Chen Pingan was willing, he could easily sell it for a few hundred coins. Thus, he had no reason to refuse Tan Yuanyi’s kindness.

Opening the slightly trembling wooden box, Chen Pingan retrieved a message-sending flying sword from Qingxia Island. The note attached indicated that Liu Lao Cheng from Gongliu Island had learned of his arrival in Shihau Country and had sent word back to Qingxia Island with a simple message: “Come back to Gongliu Island to discuss the price.”

Chen Pingan tightened his grip on a snowflake coin, allowing spiritual energy to drip into the sword stand within the wooden box. After pressing a cleverly concealed mechanism, the flying sword from Qingxia Island darted out of the box and disappeared, heading straight for Shujian Lake.

Zeng Ye watched in wide-eyed amazement. 

During their time at the shabby sword room on Maoyue Island, he had done odd jobs, but this was his first time witnessing such a unique sword stand. It was simply marvelous.

Ma Duyi was equally impressed.

Chen Pingan tucked the wooden box back into his sleeve, exhaling in satisfaction. This was great news.

As he had told Zeng Ye, the world was filled with difficulties, and all things had their beginnings. Taking the first step and standing firm was crucial.

Chen Pingan had formed an alliance with Liu Zhimiao, a supposed enemy, and Tan Yuanyi, a spy from the Great Li Dynasty, with no reason at all. 

He would also go to Gongliu Island, personally take risks, and deal with Liu Lao Cheng. 

Furthermore, by visiting all corners of Shihau Country to "correct mistakes," he aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the state of affairs there.  

Naturally, he had his own motives.

In the past, during a conversation with Gu Can's mother near the entrance of Qingxia Island, Chen Pingan had shared some thoughts. However, the woman may not have fully grasped them at the time, and many things he said lightly likely went unheard or unconsidered. Her disposition wasn’t complicated; she simply hoped for safety for herself and Gu Can amid the sudden changes at Shujian Lake, wishing that this accountant would remember their old ties and not let down a name like “Pingan” (meaning “peace”). 

Some of his words hinted at how “the future of Shujian Lake might be different.” 

The woman might not have probed deeper. 

But Chen Pingan was already acting on it.

He had to tread carefully, echoing Liu Lao Cheng’s half-joking remarks on the ferry, “Using every means necessary,” and “Such great ambitions.” 

Liu Lao Cheng had already sensed something amiss, guessing that Chen Pingan wanted to fundamentally change the rules of Shujian Lake.

Using borrowed power to do his best.

Chen Pingan refrained from discussing the moralities of others and instead focused on doing one thing: treating everyone like chess pieces, trying to carve out a larger piece of the chessboard for himself, from the pieces to the shape, and then to the momentum.

He hoped that within the future grand rules of Shujian Lake, he could at least participate in setting those rules.

That was why Liu Lao Cheng had asked if Chen Pingan had learned chess from Mr. Qi of Lizhu Cave Heaven.

It was the same reasoning.

In their exchanges, both parties had been testing each other, engaged in a tug-of-war.

The currents running beneath, scheming against one another, on the chessboard, each sought out the other’s weaknesses, making unreasonable moves or divine maneuvers, all according to their own principles.

Whether facing Liu Lao Cheng, a five-realms cultivator on Gongliu Island, or even Liu Zhimiao of the Nascent Soul, Chen Pingan spoke through his fists. Once he crossed the line and entered the realm of great Dao disputes, blocking any of their paths would be tantamount to seeking death. Since the difference in realms was so vast, it was useless to argue; even trying to speak with one’s fists was suicidal. And given that Chen Pingan had his own ambitions, what was he to do? He could only invest effort into "cultivating his heart," carefully assessing the unspoken weight of all potential chess pieces—their demands, limits, temperaments, and rules.

If possible, he would try to strike deals with the prince Han Jingling, who had fled to Shujian Lake, the son of a border general, Huang He, and even with the formidable Great Li general, Su Gaoshan, who was wrapped in power.

The difficulty lay in the fact that compared to correcting various wrongs for his peace of mind, and fulfilling the wishes of those resentful spirits, the secret plan Chen Pingan was currently hatching was far more arduous. This was the first time he was attempting to shape a chessboard as a player, where every step had to be precise—one misstep would lead to total defeat. This was akin to making the biggest move possible.

As for the former, preventing Gu Can from making mistakes and then taking on those corrections himself, other than consuming energy, effort, and money, he wouldn’t lose more; rather, he wouldn’t feel as if he were walking on thin ice.

Yet, why was it that Chen Pingan, who was particularly adept at hiding his emotions, had even made Zeng Ye notice the subtle changes in his mood?

It was because after seeing Su Xinzai and the others off, he experienced an even greater, seemingly insurmountable disappointment that lingered in his heart, refusing to dissipate.

That feeling wasn’t like when he was in the somewhat gloomy house on Qingxia Island, when he had yet to summon all the souls. Just a glance at the Yama Temple on the table would send a chill through him, as if countless vengeful spirits were knocking at his heart’s door, crying out for justice, cursing, and howling.

After each farewell, Chen Pingan’s disappointment stemmed from a sudden realization: among the names of those who had died unjustly in the ledgers, the ones he felt truly guilty about, like Su Xinzai, who had always reminisced about Huang Li Mountain and his mentor, had chosen to let go of their obsessions and leave the world entirely. Ironically, many of the names and spirits that Chen Pingan had initially felt guilty about were not as earnest in their wishes, with some demanding more, harboring deep grudges, and lingering in places like the Yama Temple or the imitation of the Liuli Pavilion.

In truth, after making up his mind, Chen Pingan had already moved past much of that guilt. Yet, Su Xinzai and the others had caused him to feel guilty once more, even more so than initially—the weight of it heavier.

That feeling still lingered outside the door of his heart, but those outside, having resolved to leave the world, bore no grievances, not an ounce of curses. It was as if, after gently knocking, they moved lightly, as if worried about disturbing those inside, simply saying the same farewell, “Mr. Chen, I’m leaving now.”

At this moment, 

Chen Pingan suddenly kicked his horse and accelerated forward, leaving the muddy official road behind and taking a detour towards a small hill.

Riding up the hill, the terrain was uneven.

Chen Pingan reined in his horse at the top of the hill.

Zeng Ye wanted to spur his horse to follow, but Ma Duyi stopped him.

Chen Pingan looked around in confusion.

With a sword-nurturing gourd and a knife at his waist, he could ride through the storms of the martial world. 

But in reality, 

he was all alone, with no one to rely on.

Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye had stopped their horses at the bottom of the hill for quite some time and were still waiting for Chen Pingan to turn his horse around.

Ma Duyi, who had previously stopped Zeng Ye, was growing anxious, while Zeng Ye remained patient, unfazed.

Ma Duyi couldn’t stand Zeng Ye’s attitude of “fools have good fortune” and “being content without knowing it,” and said with a laugh, “You carefree person, as long as you’re well-fed and watered, you have no worries at all.”

Zeng Ye, being just a timid and dull-witted boy, didn’t dare to retort, especially since he felt Ma Duyi wasn’t wrong.

Just as Ma Duyi was about to speak again, Chen Pingan rode down the slope. To Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye’s eyes, this Mr. Chen looked quite different.

He no longer seemed burdened by heavy thoughts; rather, the gloom had lifted, and he appeared somewhat pleased?

Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye exchanged glances.

Chen Pingan took a swig from the sword-nurturing gourd and smiled, “Let’s continue on our way.”

The three riders continued northward along the winding path.

The snow along the way was deep, melting slowly, and the landscape was nearly devoid of any greenery, yet they finally had some warm sunlight.

During this journey, Zeng Ye had seen quite a bit. He had encountered the legendary scouts of the Great Li at the border—a mix of old armor and bows, each scout’s face bearing no arrogance, nor any murderous intent; they were as calm and silent as water beneath the ice. The Great Li scouts merely glanced at the trio before whistling past, causing the tall boy, who had been holding his breath in fear, to finally relax when that squad of scouts had moved a dozen steps away.

He also saw a long line of noble carriages hurrying southward, a seemingly endless procession. From the attendants to the drivers, and even the occasional peeking faces from behind curtains, everyone looked anxious.

Zeng Ye noticed when Chen Pingan halted beside the road, waiting for the convoy to pass before continuing on, only to spot a small box fallen in the mud, neglected by its owner. Chen Pingan dismounted, opened the box, and found it filled with ancient texts. Flipping through one, he saw several book seals from different dynasties, different scripts, and different readers. Chen Pingan hugged the box, glanced back, and after some thought, decided not to return the abandoned box of books. Instead, he temporarily stored it in his possession and remounted his horse.

Ma Duyi, looking for conversation, jested, “Oh, I didn’t expect you to be this kind of person, just claiming it for yourself?”

Zeng Ye, rarely bold, chimed in defensively, “If someone doesn’t want it, especially books, shouldn’t they be left to rot in the mud?”

Chen Pingan shook his head. “They are fleeing for their lives. Even delaying them for a moment could lead to unforeseen consequences.”

Zeng Ye shot a glance at Ma Duyi.

Ma Duyi rolled her eyes.

Later, a female spirit residing in a fox-skin talisman, having traversed a small county unscathed by war, used her slightly unfamiliar local dialect to inquire until she finally found a grand residence. After that, a group of four settled into an inn. That evening, Chen Pingan first tucked away the talisman, quietly infiltrated the residence, and then took it out to reveal her presence, ultimately encountering the handsome scholar who had left home for the capital to take the imperial exams. Now, the scholar was nearing fifty, a middle-aged Confucian, cradling a slightly sleeping young son, laughing and toasting with a few bureaucratic friends, their faces radiant with joy. His friends congratulated him, celebrating his good fortune from misfortune, for having befriended a Great Li captain, thus earning promotion to the third-ranking official in this county. They jokingly remarked about not forgetting old friends after gaining wealth, and the old scholar, still dressed in common clothes, laughed heartily.

The fox-skin spirit’s expression darkened; it seemed she hardly recognized the childhood friend anymore, perhaps due to the passage of time.

After leaving the residence, the fox-skin spirit walked silently alongside Chen Pingan on the quiet street.

Suddenly, Chen Pingan remarked, “That child resembles his father more, don’t you think?”

The woman hummed in agreement, her face lighting up. “It does seem that way!”

Afterward, they left the small county town, which the Great Li cavalry dismissed as inconsequential, and the three continued northward.

In a small county town where they needed to stop and buy supplies, as Chen Pingan passed by a larger gold and silver shop, he hesitated for a moment before turning back and stepping inside.

Inside were two elderly men and two young boys, all shop assistants, busy with their tasks.

Chen Pingan pulled out a gold ingot marked with the seal of Shihau’s government and exchanged it for government silver and a pile of copper coins.

The two elder shopkeepers didn’t interfere, allowing their young apprentices to handle the transactions. After all, in the market, one hopes to raise sons who can take care of them in their old age. So, naturally, the master should guide capable apprentices who can be useful. Among the two similarly aged boys, one was shy and clumsy, much like Zeng Ye, while the other had sharp features. As soon as Chen Pingan stepped through the door, the clever boy sized him up from head to toe twice.

After handing over the gold ingot, Chen Pingan took slightly above-market value in government silver and copper coins. During the exchange, he first spoke in the official dialect of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, which left the two boys somewhat dazed. Then he switched to the official dialect of Shihau with some difficulty, allowing the transaction to proceed smoothly before he left the shop.

Inside the shop, after the man in the cotton robe exited, the clumsy boy was still lost in the joy of making a profit for the shop. He kicked his childhood friend, following the latter’s gaze and realizing that their two masters, who constantly bickered, were sitting together for the first time, seriously discussing something.

After Chen Pingan returned to Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye’s side, Ma Duyi laughed and asked, “In this small county town, with such a tiny shop, there are actually two Qi practitioners?”

Chen Pingan nodded. “They must be selecting disciples, each eyeing a young boy.”

Ma Duyi scoffed. “Those two old men are barely at the Cave Dwelling realm. What good apprentices could they possibly find?”

Chen Pingan chuckled. “Isn’t that something I should be saying?”

Ma Duyi snorted.

Chen Pingan hesitated before saying, “If I’m not mistaken, one of those old men should be at the Ocean-Viewing realm, and the other might even be at the Dragon Gate realm. However, they quickly noticed you, so they hid their auras, deliberately making you think they were at the Cave Dwelling realm. As for why they didn’t simply pretend to be ordinary townsfolk, they probably figured that in such a remote place with sparse spiritual energy, two Cave Dwelling realm cultivators would be enough to intimidate us passing dragons without being too conspicuous. So, they must be seasoned veterans.”

Ma Duyi’s eyes lit up. “Mr. Chen, what if they think we’re here for them? For example, to poach their disciples? I think it was a mistake for you to enter that shop.”

Chen Pingan smiled. “That’s why we, as outsiders, will buy our supplies and immediately depart. Also, let’s agree that when we leave the county town’s gate, remember not to look around; just keep your head down and hurry along so they don’t get suspicious.”

Ma Duyi looked puzzled, still unable to grasp why Chen Pingan had entered that shop; it didn’t align with his usual conduct.

Chen Pingan instructed Zeng Ye to go into a shop alone to buy something while he and Ma Duyi tied their horses outside on the street. He quietly explained, “What if those two old men aren’t just looking for disciples? What if they’re not reputable sect masters but rather obscure practitioners of odd paths? That’s why I took a closer look in the shop. They didn’t seem like malevolent cultivators with ulterior motives. As for anything beyond that, since I can’t discern it, I won’t meddle.”

Ma Duyi sighed, her eyes sparkling with amusement, and complained, “Mr. Chen, thinking about so many things every day—don’t you get tired? Just listening to you makes me feel exhausted.”

Chen Pingan laughed. “Thinking about these things doesn’t tire me. But when I think about how you refuse to return to the talisman every day, I have to count how many snowflake coins I’ve spent, and that’s what bothers me.”

Ma Duyi felt both annoyed and embarrassed. “You’re such a bore!”

Chen Pingan merely smiled, hands tucked into his sleeves.
