 ### Chapter 591: A Good Day

Inside the City God Temple.

After Chuyi vanished with the rusty fragments of the golden statue, he soon reappeared, sending forth a brilliant white rainbow that struck down the majority of the civil and military judges, as well as the various ghost officials and wandering spirits, including the Chain General. In the end, only the civil judge of the City God Temple and the recently appointed Chain General remained, along with a few low-ranking ghost officials.

The fifteenth spirit residing in the Sword-raising Gourd chose not to show himself this time. 

Chen Ping'an waved his sleeve, gathering the faintly golden and pure silver fragments of the golden statue into his hand and placing them into a small space. He then continued to gaze up at the black sea of clouds, now less than three hundred feet above the ground of Suijia City.

After a moment of thought, Chen Ping'an flicked out a golden barrier-breaking talisman that had not burned out completely earlier on Cangjun Lake, and then he decided to try out the Jade Clarity Brightness Talisman. 

Tonight’s first defense against the heavenly tribulation would naturally rely on his own abilities. As for what came afterward, there was no need for excessive fuss.

Chuyi continued to drift restlessly within the City God Temple, the sound of breaking air buzzing around him. 

Chen Ping'an turned to look at the ghost officials who dared not move, casting just a glance. 

Standing for justice, compassion for the common people, managing the affairs of heaven and earth, cutting evil and eliminating calamity? 

Chuyi, who had seemingly decided to spare the remaining ghost officials, suddenly unleashed a streak of white sword light, piercing through several ghost officials responsible for punishing evil and prolonging life, causing them to dissipate on the spot.

Chen Ping'an took a deep breath and turned away from those ghost officials who enjoyed the offerings alongside the City God. "Aren't you leaving? Do you want to stay in the City God Temple and face the heavenly tribulation with me?"

They scattered in panic, seeking to put as much distance as possible from the City God Temple, hoping to leave Suijia City altogether. 

A middle-aged man with a bushy beard unexpectedly walked into the City God Temple. Earlier, he had spat on the ground fiercely at the entrance before entering the main hall and seeing the young sword immortal, who was holding his breath and focusing. The man hesitated for a moment and asked in a deep voice, "What are you doing? Officially speaking, as a local deity of the county, I shouldn't advise you to leave. After all, for the sake of the people, it's better if fewer die. But personally, I hope you don’t meddle in this. It's not that I look down on your skills as a sword immortal. The heavenly tribulation is extremely entangled; it’s not as simple as just enduring it. Since you are already a sword immortal, don’t you understand the complexities of this matter? Cultivating is not easy; why go to such lengths?"

Chen Ping'an turned around and asked, "Are you from the Fire God Temple?"

The man nodded, saying, "I must have committed great sins in my last life. Even in death, I’m stuck being the deity of the Fire God Temple. I haven’t had a day of peace in these past several hundred years."

Chen Ping'an inquired, "Was that governor protected by you when he was a child and sent out of Suijia City?"

The man grinned, "If you had asked me this when the City God was still alive, I wouldn’t have dared to admit it, even if it meant getting beaten to death."

Chen Ping'an chuckled. "You can leave; there’s no need to advise me. I reckon that once the heavenly tribulation strikes, you, as the immovable deity of Suijia City, will find it harder to survive than I will."

The man laughed heartily. "It’s nothing. Once you become a local deity, you realize what true suffering is. Half-dead is worse than being completely dead. I’m off to the roof of the Fire God Temple, sitting there with my eyes wide open, hoping to catch a glimpse of the legendary sword immortal’s style before I die completely."

Chen Ping'an nodded. 

The man turned to leave, and as he reached the door, he suddenly turned his head and asked, "As a local deity, I have not been able to do anything useful. You, as a sword immortal, are clearly a straightforward... good person. You don’t bear a grudge, nor do you vent your anger?"

Chen Ping'an countered, "Putting aside who I am and what my cultivation level is, in this world, does anyone truly have the strength and resolve to blame a good person for not doing well enough? Why not expect them to step up and slay the bad guys? Why not even spare a few words of scorn for the wicked?"

The man burst out laughing and walked away in large strides. "Naturally, good people are easy to bully. You, as an outsider sword immortal, truly ask a foolish question!"

As he crossed the threshold, he clasped his hands in a salute above his head, shaking them vigorously before striding away. The boisterous voice of the bearded deity echoed through the night, "If you weren’t foolish, you wouldn’t have entered this den of snakes and rats at the City God Temple. Sword immortal, don’t die! This damn world has too few capable good people! If you let your emotions dictate your actions and die in this worthless dump, I’ll definitely scold you severely!"

Chen Ping'an hurled the golden barrier-breaking talisman at the oppressive black clouds above, testing the depth of the heavenly tribulation.

The bottom of the sea of clouds exploded into a massive golden hole, as large as the City God Temple itself. 

However, the clouds roiled and quickly closed up again.

Chen Ping'an had seen that the clouds were exceedingly thick, and the talisman showed no signs of penetrating the cloud layer above.

Taking a deep breath, Chen Ping'an steadied himself, leaning on his sword as he looked up at the sky.

Within a hundred feet, he could unleash his first strike. However, beyond two hundred feet, he could throw a punch first.

After the anomalies at the City God Temple emerged, Fan Weiran, who had settled in Suijia City, decisively led the cultivators from Baodong Immortal Realm, along with others to remind their affiliated qi practitioners, to quickly leave Suijia City and head to Cangjun Lake. After all, the Lake Lord owed her Fan Weiran a considerable favor. He wouldn’t dare let his guard down after that night’s banquet, where he couldn’t control his wandering eyes, which allowed Yan Qing to excuse herself from the Dragon Palace banquet to visit the Water God Temple of the Zao Creek Master.

After that, there were continuous upheavals. Once Yan Qing arrived in Suijia City, she became unsettled. Not to mention Fan Weiran, even Yan Qing’s peers noticed something was amiss.

Fan Weiran’s deep resentment towards the young sword immortal intensified; how dare he disrupt my Yan girl’s state of mind! She had already been recognized by that immortal as one of the future leaders of the Baodong Immortal Realm and the entire alliance of several nations. Once Yan Qing finally emerged victorious, Baodong Immortal Realm would have access to a new path of immortal cultivation.

Over the years, Baodong Immortal Realm and Huangyue City had merely been pawns selected in the covert game of fishing for opportunities in the ponds of several nations. 

What was the point of fighting to the death, as if they were enemies? How many cultivators from either side had truly died? Very few, and among those, most were seemingly at the same level but actually lacked hope for the Dao, while even fewer were those from affiliated sects.

In the past two hundred years, why had no Gold Body realm martial artist emerged in the several nations’ martial world? The last one had been killed by his own junior sister and Ye Han back in the day.

Now, those martial artists boasting prowess in the secular kingdoms, claiming to be grandmasters of martial arts, such as the so-called top sword and fist fighters, were nothing more than decaying husks, nearing death.

Fan Weiran turned to glance at Yan Qing, who was beside her, and smiled faintly. Her junior sister, for some reason, had felt the need to kill that Gold Body realm martial artist, but she knew all too well why. After all, this massive secret was known only to one person from each of Baodong Immortal Realm and Huangyue City throughout history. As for the other peaks, they had never even had the chance or qualifications to meet that immortal.

As for that inexplicable outsider sword immortal, being caught in the heavenly tribulation and accidentally dying at the City God Temple would be best; that would be a small mercy for you. Otherwise, if he were injured and captured by Fan Weiran, compared to the unique secret techniques of the Baodong Immortal Realm’s Grandmaster Hall, what was the Weeping Water Lamp of the Yin Marquis at Cangjun Lake?

The direction of Baodong Immortal Realm and the affiliated sects was unified; they all rushed swiftly toward Cangjun Lake. However, those who couldn’t ride the winds and fly could only rely on their two legs to dash, and at worst, they could only ride horses out of the city.

After Fan Weiran left Suijia City riding the winds, she suddenly asked, "Those lowly soldiers from the Ghost Axe Palace didn’t come out of the city with us?"

Beside the old woman, a younger cultivator, hidden in the wild under the guise of a current aide to the county governor, respectfully replied, "Reporting to the ancestor, after receiving my news at an inn, for some reason, they did not leave immediately, claiming they had urgent matters to handle. I dared not linger and left first, only to find that they had departed Suijia City in another direction. I’m not sure if they’re heading toward Cangjun Lake to meet us."

Fan Weiran's expression darkened with anger. "What about that guy named Du Yu? Have you seen him?"

The old cultivator replied, "I did see him at the inn; he really is as the rumors say, carefree and without a serious demeanor, quite useless."

The commotion at Cangjun Lake was significant, but no cultivators in Suijia City dared approach to watch the battle. At the level of the Lake Lord, applauding from the sidelines would not be welcomed; one wave of his sleeve could turn you to ashes. Not to mention, the treasures and techniques of the immortals did not discriminate; if one wandered into the gates of hell, dying would be a waste.

Thus, the old cultivator wondered, "Why did the ancestor specifically ask about this person?"

Fan Weiran's face turned grim; she did not reveal the great secret but coldly smiled, "I’ll settle the score with that bastard later!"

The premise, of course, was that the outsider sword immortal surnamed Chen was dead or had lost most of his life in Suijia City.

As Yan Qing rode the winds, she glanced back at the blurred outline of Suijia City.

She could vaguely see a golden talisman exploding at the base of the heavenly tribulation clouds.

Yan Qing sighed deeply within. 

A young sword immortal capable of calculating human hearts turned out to be a fool.

Farther away from Cangjun Lake and Suijia City, at the summit of Black Glaze Mountain, stood a tall, simply-dressed middle-aged man, adorned only with a jade plaque hanging at his waist. 

The man extended a finger, gently stroking the inscriptions on the jade plaque, lost in thought.

The handsome youth, He Lu, sat beside him, taking down an aged bamboo flute, gently wiping it with a rare silken cloth woven by the immortals.

The middle-aged man merely gazed towards Suijia City, where the oppressive black clouds slowly descended, as if the entire sky was dropping down to the human realm. At a glance, the peak of the sea of clouds was nowhere to be seen.

A white-haired old man sitting cross-legged chuckled, "The heavens and earth clash without reason; this is the great calamity of the human world. City Master, once this heavenly tribulation descends, I don’t think the Black Glaze Mountain’s water formation will hold. That Fan woman is quite shrewd; she’s got ties with the Lake Lord of Cangjun Lake. She has the advantage here, compared to us who can only choose Black Glaze Mountain and spend our own resources to build formations."

The white-haired old man kept patting his legs, lamenting, "I really don’t know what that outsider sword immortal is thinking. Even if he wants to take advantage of us and Baodong Immortal Realm, couldn’t he at least wait until the extraordinary treasure appears? If he really kills the City God, the heavenly tribulation will surely come for him. What the hell is he after? City Master, I’m not very bright; can you enlighten me? I can’t wrap my head around this, especially when seeing a stunning beauty makes my heart itch."

The man in the pavilion was none other than Ye Han, the City Master of Huangyue City.

Ye Han replied, "An outsider sword immortal crashing into the game doesn’t fundamentally alter the chessboard; the situation hasn’t changed much. The surprises brought by his cultivation will be worn down by the heavenly tribulation. What I’m worried about isn’t him or Baodong Immortal Realm and Fan Weiran, but rather a few other outsiders, who are much sneakier than this straightforward sword immortal. For now, all I know is that the fox spirit from Silver Screen Kingdom belongs to this group."

As soon as the old man heard about the fox spirit, his interest piqued. "A flowing emperor from Silver Screen Kingdom and a solid queen! Haha, how amusing. So she’s also from the outside? I thought we couldn’t breed a five-tailed heavenly fox in our lands."

Ye Han shook his head. "She’s well-hidden; she’s actually a six-tailed Golden Core fox spirit. This information was obtained by Huangyue City at the cost of a Dragon Gate realm cultivator’s life."

The white-haired old man exclaimed, "Then I’ll have to avoid her when I see her in the future. Damn, a Golden Core! Isn’t that exactly like you, City Master?!"

He Lu only wiped his bamboo flute, uninterested in the secrets that were considered top-level matters on the mountain.

Ye Han shook his head. "Cultivators of the same realm can differ vastly. The fox spirit is skilled at enchanting mortals, which gives her an advantage, but when it comes to battling, fox spirits aren’t particularly adept. I don’t think she can surpass Fan Weiran. However, since she's from the outside, she must have one or two special artifacts with her. If I face off against Fan Weiran, the odds of victory won’t be very high; I don’t even dare to hope for success in killing her."

Ye Han turned and smiled, "If the opportunity arises, that sword he carries on his back, if it truly is a treasure, I can try to negotiate for it later and see if I can trade something for it to give you."

The white-haired old man looked confused. "City Master, what do you mean by trading? Also, do you really need to negotiate for anything here?"

Ye Han shook his head. "Don’t ask what you shouldn’t."

Upon hearing the City Master of Huangyue’s promise, He Lu’s eyes brightened. Suddenly, the handsome youth glanced toward Suijia City, his expression illuminating as if a wick had been trimmed.

Ye Han shook his head. "Don’t think about it. Neither you nor I dare have any extra thoughts."

Ye Han’s expression grew serious as he said with a ripple of thought, "He Lu, a great battle is imminent. I must remind you of a few things. Although your talent and fortune are slightly better than Yan Qing’s, allowing you to accompany me to the immortal residence to see the immortal, the immortal himself did not show but only had someone receive us. This is already a great honor, putting you ahead of Yan Qing. However, the cultivation on this mountain is arduous; those who travel a hundred miles must consider ninety. A difference of one realm is as different as clouds and mud. Therefore, the little boy from that immortal residence, relying on the immortal’s backing, dares to speak to me disrespectfully. That extraordinary treasure, I’ve already disclosed its roots to you; it’s an innate sword embryo. Sword embryos in the world are divided into those of people and those of objects. The former determines from birth whether one can become a unique sword immortal, while the latter can even allow a qi practitioner who isn’t a sword embryo to become a sword immortal. This kind of rare treasure, even if I were to stealthily seize it, would you, He Lu, be able to handle it or guard it?"

He Lu, putting down his bamboo flute, stood up respectfully. "Disciple understands!"

Outside Suijia City, on a northern mountain peak.

A man clad in divine armor with a sword at his waist looked back at the City God Temple.

Du Yu was confused and couldn't understand. 

Why would that senior, who was most adept at calculating gains and losses and human sentiments, act so impulsively? 

The lives of tens of thousands of ordinary people could not be compared to the cultivation and life of a sword immortal like him!

This outrageous sentiment, even if that senior stood before him now, Du Yu would still dare to shout it out, even if it meant getting slapped half to death or being imprisoned in a soul cage.

On this night. 

The sea of clouds sank as if heaven and earth were colliding.

Aside from the cultivators at Cangjun Lake’s Dragon Palace and the pavilion at Black Glaze Mountain, Fan Weiran and Ye Han, after paying a price, could use the power to observe the mountains and rivers to see the final scene. The remaining qi practitioners in the mountains, who had scattered like birds and beasts, saw less than the ordinary townsfolk who were destined to live mundane lives in Suijia City.

Even Fan Weiran and Yan Qing, as well as Ye Han and He Lu beside her, could only see within the narrow space between a hundred feet off the ground and a hundred feet from the clouds.

There was a young man in a green shirt wielding a sword, continuously striking.

As the sea of clouds slowly descended to within a hundred feet of Suijia City, Fan Weiran and Ye Han almost simultaneously withdrew their divine powers, both pale-faced.

The final scene was that a streak of golden sword light rose from the ground, seemingly slicing through the entire sea of clouds from south to north in an instant.

After that, in the territory of a county, only the sound of thunder remained, the sword light circling within the sea of clouds, mixed with fleeting bursts of talismanic light.

When heaven and earth finally returned to silence, the cloud cover that enveloped Suijia City gradually dissipated.

Inside the prison of the government office in Suijia City, an unusual sword light, darker than the night, burst forth from the ground, leaving behind a long, soaring black line before flying away.

At the pavilion on Black Glaze Mountain, Ye Han and at Cangjun Lake, Fan Weiran, shared a moment of understanding and simultaneously issued commands, preparing to seize that extraordinary treasure that had finally emerged.

Countless sects’ immortal teachers, wild cultivators hoping to pick up scraps, and martial artists affiliated with qi practitioners surged forth like bamboo shoots after rain, chasing after that black line. 

Then, after flying over a hundred miles, that black line was suddenly swallowed by a small monkey, hidden within the sleeve of an old man as he began to flee.

A pursuit and chaotic battle began.

Only an inconspicuous cultivator from Ghost Axe Palace rushed toward Suijia City.

He noticed that the entire Suijia City, including the city walls, had been leveled as if sliced off with a knife. 

Clad in snow-white armor, the man leaped onto the city wall. After hesitating for a moment, he ultimately chose not to enter the city immediately. Instead, he walked around the top of the wall, and what he could see was that the City God Temple had become a wasteland, many buildings of wealthy households collapsed to the ground. Inside Suijia City, there was a cacophony of cries, mixed with countless shouts of sorrow; almost every household had lit lamps. Perhaps from the first day of the city's founding, no night had ever been so brightly lit, like broad daylight.

Du Yu gritted his teeth, not daring to ride the winds but instead retracting his divine armor and storing it in his sleeves. Only then did he stealthily leap down from the wall, avoiding the main streets and opting for the narrow alleys to rush toward the City God Temple.

Along the way, children cried, women busied themselves soothing them, young men cursed angrily, and the elderly mostly chanted scriptures and prayed at home, striking wooden fish. Some bold ruffians peeked around, looking for opportunities to make a quick fortune.

Wealthy households began to post the talismans that had been hired from temples, regardless of what they were, just to stick them up.

Upon reaching the street outside the City God Temple, Du Yu charged in and immediately saw a bloodied figure, devoid of flesh, standing with a sword in hand.

Du Yu glanced at the dimly glowing long sword, shook his head fiercely, then gave himself a few hard slaps. He clasped his hands together, his expression resolute, softly saying, "Senior, don’t worry. Trust me, Du Yu, just this once. I’ll carry you to a quiet place; this place isn’t safe for long!"

Du Yu waited for a moment. "Since senior isn’t speaking, I’ll take that as an agreement?!"

Finally, Du Yu approached the bloodied figure. 

Just as he was about to squat down and lift the senior onto his back, he failed to witness a scene that would have shattered his courage.

The figure, no longer even recognizable as a person, slowly turned its head slightly, and its fingers stirred.

High in the sky, an outsider cultivator hesitated for a moment before deciding to leave.

Du Yu slapped his forehead, remembering that the sword was a hindrance—how could he carry someone?

He attempted to gently pry open the senior’s fingers, but they wouldn’t budge. Du Yu's face fell in despair—what should he do?

When Du Yu's fingers barely grazed the hilt of that sword, he was suddenly flung backward, his soul jolted, pain coursing through him, not any less than when the senior had brushed past his three souls and seven spirits at the Water Immortal Shrine of the Zao Creek Master!

Du Yu struggled to get up, spitting out a mouthful of blood, his complexion as pale as a sheet. When he opened his hand, one of his fingers was nearly burnt to a crisp.

Then, the sword suddenly trembled, leaving the senior’s hands and gliding back behind him, sheathing itself lightly.

The old cultivator who continued observing the ruins of the City God Temple from high above sighed softly, as if filled with regret, before finally taking his leave.

Only now could Du Yu carry the blood-soaked figure, stumbling like a headless fly through the narrow alleys, or leaping onto rooftops, until he finally found a dilapidated house devoid of inhabitants. Kicking open a room covered in cobwebs, he intended to lay the bloodied senior down on the bed, but upon seeing that the bed was nothing but a filthy wooden plank without a blanket, he had to use his foot to pull over a nearly rotting rocking chair, gently placing the figure down on the creaky chair. Afterward, Du Yu, covered in blood, retrieved a porcelain vial and placed it beside the senior’s chair. He took a few steps back, wiping the sweat from his forehead. "Senior, I’m afraid of death—really afraid of death. This is all I can do."

Du Yu forced a smile, saying, "If senior hasn’t died, and I get captured while you’re recovering, I’ll still clearly reveal this place’s address to them."

The figure on the chair remained silent as death.

Du Yu cupped his fists and exited the room, softly closing the door behind him.

His head was a muddle, and originally, he wanted to hastily escape Suijia City, returning to the Ghost Axe Palace to be with his parents. However, as he stepped outside and was blown by the cool wind, he immediately sobered up. Not only could he not return to the Ghost Axe Palace alone, but he also absolutely could not. The urgent task was to wipe away the traces of blood! This was both saving someone and saving himself! After Du Yu made up his mind, he no longer showed any signs of weakness and began to quietly erase the traces of blood. He even started to imagine what he would do if he were the senior in this situation.

After Du Yu left, the half-dead figure slumped on the chair slowly opened his deep-set eyes, then closed them again.

The next morning.

All the officials, wealthy households, and townsfolk in Suijia City began to bustle with anxiety.

Upon hearing about the changes at the City God Temple, a saying emerged that the City God had helped them block the unknown sea of clouds, resulting in the calamity that befell the City God Temple. In no time, countless commoners flocked to the ruins of the City God Temple to burn incense and bow down, leading to a rush at the incense shops on a single street, with many fights breaking out over the incense offerings.

The same scene occurred at the Fire God Temple, which had completely collapsed, the clay statue of the deity once revered there shattered on the ground.

Two days later, many unfamiliar faces began to appear in Suijia City. After another day, the once anxious governor of Suijia City no longer exhibited the previous day’s restlessness. With a beaming face, he ordered all officials to search for a young man in a green shirt with a red wine flask at his waist. Everyone had a drawing of him, said to be a vicious rogue passing through. The more they looked, the more they felt he was a bad person. With a generous bounty from the governor’s office, anyone who found a clue about this person would be rewarded with a hundred gold coins. If they could bring him to the office, they might even receive a recommendation from the governor himself for an official position! Thus, not only the officials but also many well-informed wealthy households treated this matter as a stroke of luck, sending out all their servants and attendants.

Not just within Suijia City, but the entire county and surrounding prefectures began a massive manhunt for this person.

After a day, the townsfolk of Suijia City sensed something was amiss. 

In the sky and throughout the city, there appeared many figures purportedly soaring through the clouds.

Upon seeing their movements, all ages, from children to the elderly, began to kneel and bow down across various places in the city.

However, on that night at the Fire God Temple, a giant man with a bushy beard, resembling a clay statue, suddenly appeared. He stood over ten feet tall, leaning on the devout offerings from the past few days, gathering his last breath before revealing his true form at the moment his golden body was about to shatter. He spoke loudly of the sword immortal's righteous deeds, proclaiming he was no foreign villain causing calamities to the City God Temple.

His hurried words resonated throughout Suijia City.

The townsfolk exchanged glances, while over at the government office, the governor's face darkened with rage.

However, before he could voice more complaints, a magical artifact flew from a great distance toward Suijia City, crashing down upon the Fire God’s deity.

The bearded golden figure shattered, scattering into countless golden lights.

The artifact continued relentlessly, completely destroying the Fire God Temple.

That evening, a young man dressed in a snow-white robe, with a red wine flask at his waist, approached the dilapidated house. He opened the door and then closed it behind him.

In the night, he sat on the roof with a bamboo fan, drinking wine while admiring the moon, ultimately falling into a drunken sleep. 

To the townsfolk, he appeared like a celestial being, save for a slightly pale complexion.

After his appearance, nearly all the qi practitioners in the city quietly retreated like a receding tide.

However, two stubborn cultivators approached the ghostly house late at night. As they neared the wall, they were suddenly pierced through the head by two beams of sword light, dying on the spot.

The following day, he visited the Fire God Temple, lit three incense sticks, and then returned to the eerie ghost house.

That day, an exceptionally conspicuous guest arrived at the ghost house.

A cultivator from Ghost Axe Palace, Du Yu.

In the yard of the ghost house, the white-clad sword immortal sat on a small stool, while Du Yu stood beside him, looking mournful. "Senior, I’m truly dead for sure! Why must you keep me here? I just wanted to check on your safety."

The man gently waved the bamboo fan, a strange and unfamiliar smile on his face as he slowly said, "If you leave today, that’s when you’ll truly be dead."

 ### Chapter 592: Just Go Ahead and Take the Sword (Part 1)

Du Yu felt a prickling sensation on his scalp. He summoned the remaining courage of an aspiring hero, but it felt as if he were climbing a mountain—by the time he reached the "summit," there was nearly none left. Hesitantly, he said, "Senior, with you acting like this, I’m... a bit afraid of you."

Chen Ping'an held the jade bamboo fan that Cui Dongshan had given him. With a flick of his fingers, the fan opened and closed gently, producing a crisp sound as he smiled, "You, Du Yu, saved my life. What’s there to be afraid of? Shouldn’t you be thinking about how to reward me instead of worrying about me settling scores later? All those petty matters from the Jianghu (martial world) were settled back at the Shao Creek Water Immortal Shrine; I have no intention of holding them against you."

Chen Ping'an wore the golden robe of divine spirit, which he hadn't donned in many years. The spring grass robe, originally a deep green, was now tattered beyond repair, no amount of divine money could restore it to its former glory. He had stored it away with the worn straw sandals and the empty wine flask. In that previous battle, the danger was so great that he hadn’t even had time to change into this golden robe; in the moment of urgency, he was unable to do so. Thus, he had to rely on his physical strength to endure the calamity from the clouds, akin to soaking in the small thunder pool of Mount Jixiao for several days and nights.

Du Yu gritted his teeth, his face carrying a mournful expression. "Senior, you aren’t planning to wipe out the ungrateful citizens of the Sui Jia City, are you?"

Chen Ping'an glanced sideways at Du Yu. “Are you foolish, or am I insane? Why would I endure this heavenly tribulation for that?”

Du Yu wiped the sweat from his forehead. "That’s a relief. Senior, please don’t hold a grudge against those ignorant commoners; it’s not worth it."

He genuinely feared that one calamity wouldn't end before another began. If that happened, it wouldn’t just be him suffering; it would certainly implicate his parents and the entire Ghost Axe Palace. If the previous encounter at the Shao Creek Water Immortal Shrine had led to Fan Weiran's wife venting her anger on him, things were different now. Perhaps even Ye Han from Huangyue City had his sights set on him.

Many things that he hadn’t thought about before now haunted him as he found himself at the gates of the netherworld, bouncing along the road to the underworld.

Especially in recent days spent in the ghost house, helping the senior clean the courtyard, fetching water, and using a rag, he found himself doing menial tasks he had never done in his life—feeling as if he had come from another world.

Chen Ping'an tucked the fan into his waist and looked over the wall. "Doing good or evil is all a personal matter. What’s there to be disappointed about?"

Du Yu nodded vigorously. "A gentleman bestows kindness without expecting reward—truly a noble sentiment, Senior!"

Chen Ping'an laughed. "Just cut it out. Stop buttering me up with flattery; your Daoist cultivation is too low for such words. It's hard for you to say them, and they bore me to hear. I've tolerated it for long enough."

Du Yu smiled awkwardly.

Chen Ping'an placed the sword-raising gourd on a bamboo chair and lightly tapped the sword on the ground, causing it to bounce up into his hand. "You stay here. I’ll step out for a while."

Du Yu naturally didn’t dare question the senior’s decision and cautiously asked, "When will you return to the house, Senior?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "I just need to make a quick trip to the local magistrate's office and then to Cangyun Lake or Black Glaze Mountain. It shouldn’t take long."

Du Yu sighed in relief.

Chen Ping'an walked out of the ghost house.

Du Yu clasped his hands together in front of the crimson wine jug, bending slightly as he prayed, "Thank you, Grand Wine Jug, for your protection."

As the ghost house door swung open, the figure of the white-robed immortal truly appeared.

The once-boisterous citizens of Sui Jia City, regardless of gender or age, scattered like startled birds. Among the fleeing crowd were members of wealthy families who considered themselves wronged and had suffered heavy losses, as well as servants sent by their masters to demand reparations, ruffians drawn from various corners of the city, and many curious young men eager to see what a sword immortal looked like.

Everyone said that this wandering sword immortal had a gentle temperament, was immensely wealthy, and was severely injured, needing to stay in Sui Jia City for an extended period to recuperate. His long stay hidden in the ghost house had already proven this point. But who knew whether he would seize someone on the street once he left the ghost house? After all, he was a true sword immortal; even a starving camel is bigger than a horse, so caution was warranted.

Just then, a group of young men came racing by, pushing a dung cart while laughing heartily. They were reveling in their bravado, enjoying the thumbs-up and cheers from the nearby onlookers, pushing the cart with even more gusto as they neared the ominous ghost house, just twenty or thirty steps away. At that moment, the white-robed immortal emerged from the house and fixed his gaze upon them.

Three young men, accustomed to loafing around Sui Jia City, were suddenly rooted to the spot, unable to move.

Not only that, but a woman dressed in plain white, with a baby swaddled in her arms, emerged slowly from a street corner. The weather was bone-chillingly cold, and the child, whether in deep sleep or frostbitten, made no sound. The woman's face was filled with sorrow, and her pace quickened as she hurried past the dung cart and the group of young men. Suddenly, she fell to her knees on the street, looking up at the young man in white and sobbing uncontrollably, "Great Immortal, my husband was crushed to death by our collapsing house! As a woman, how am I supposed to survive now? I implore you, Great Immortal, to show mercy and save us!"

The woman cried out in despair, her heart-wrenching wails likely to make anyone who heard her shed tears.

Onlookers in the distance began to murmur, pointing fingers as some quietly spoke, recognizing her as the woman from Ya'er Alley, who had indeed lost her husband last spring.

Such a pitiful sight.

Chen Ping'an crouched down, "In this freezing weather, with such a small child, how could you, as a mother, bear to do this? Shouldn't you entrust the child to familiar neighbors instead of coming here to plead your case? Ah, but I suppose if you're destined to die, what does it matter?"

The woman seemed momentarily stunned, as if she had never expected the young sword immortal to speak so bluntly.

Then the young man smiled, "Your posture holding the child seems a bit awkward. Is this your firstborn?"

The woman suddenly wailed loudly, unable to respond.

Chen Ping'an, with his hands tucked into his sleeves, spoke slowly, "Let me guess, if I ignore you and walk past, you’ll raise that child high and say that if I don’t save you, you won’t live, right? Since you can’t live anyway, why not just let the poor child die here and be reborn into a better family? After all, you’ve wronged him this life, and if you meet a heartless immortal, you could always crash your head against a wall, fake a faint, and then just pretend to die, right? Then you’d merely need to find another man to marry and live lavishly afterward. Isn’t that better?"

The woman was only filled with despair, her cries piercing the hearts of those who heard.

Chen Ping'an glanced at a man in the distance who had revealed the woman’s identity and smiled faintly. The man’s expression changed slightly, and he quickly slipped away down an alley.

The man who fled in haste was hiding in a dung barrel, an assassin waiting for the right moment.

These schemes and plots were likely orchestrated by someone behind the scenes, not even realizing they’d amount to anything. Purely meant to cause trouble?

Chen Ping'an found it somewhat amusing.

The Cangyun Lake’s Lord Yin certainly didn’t have the guts for such schemes at the moment, while Fan Weiran of the Baodong Immortal Realm lacked such cunning. What about Ye Han from Huangyue City, whom he had yet to meet? Or that young man named He Lu, who might have borrowed the hand of an official clerk from Sui Jia City? Everyone involved—the Qi cultivator, the street woman, and the martial artist—might die without ever knowing who sent them to their demise, each with their own reasons and arrangements for coming here to meet their end.

What to do?

Chen Ping'an truly felt disgusted.

Suddenly, the woman's vision blurred.

The young white-robed immortal had vanished from sight.

Clenching her teeth, she stood up, raising the swaddled child high to throw it onto the ground. Before doing so, she turned towards the alley and cried out, "This sword immortal is heartless! He killed my husband and feels no guilt! If my child and I die today, we’ll haunt him as ghosts!"

With that, she hurled the child towards the street, hoping it wouldn’t die in one blow. That would be a significant problem, so she put all her strength into it. 

Her entire life’s wealth depended on this one act.

After throwing the child, she felt drained and collapsed onto the ground.

Then, her eyes widened in shock.

The white-robed immortal had somehow appeared before her, cradling the swaddled child with one hand.

Chen Ping'an stood up, holding the child gently. He used his fingers to peel back a corner of the swaddling cloth, moving delicately as he touched the baby’s small hand. Thankfully, the child was merely a bit cold, likely deemed unnecessary to harm since it was destined to die anyway. As expected, these cultivators had such limited intelligence; it wasn’t easy to be a good person, but what about being a thoroughly rotten villain?

Chen Ping'an tugged at the corners of his mouth, and when he looked at the child in his arms, his expression softened naturally. He expertly wrapped the child a bit tighter in the swaddling cloth and carefully emanated warmth from his palms to combat the biting cold.

No child is born destined to suffer hardships.

With a gentle push of his toes, he gracefully leapt, like a white rainbow, returning to the ghost house.

Du Yu, perhaps feeling uneasy inside, didn’t dare to sit on the chair where the sword-raising gourd was placed. Instead, he moved a small stool beside the bamboo chair, sitting quietly and still, taking care not to forget to wear the divine Gan Lu armor.

Upon seeing his senior return, Du Yu noticed... a swaddled child in his arms? What was his senior doing? He could easily convince himself that the senior had found his Gan Lu armor and refined demon dan on the way, but bringing back a child? Du Yu was genuinely dumbfounded.

Chen Ping'an carefully handed the child to Du Yu, who felt as if he had been struck by lightning, extending his hands in a daze.

Chen Ping'an frowned. "Remove the Gan Lu armor!"

Du Yu jumped in surprise and quickly took off the Gan Lu armor, storing it along with the demon dan he had been clutching tightly in his sleeve.

Stiffly accepting the child, he felt a sense of helplessness wash over him. Seeing his senior's expression of disdain, Du Yu felt like crying. Senior, I’m still young, with little experience in the Jianghu; I can’t possibly be as knowledgeable as you in everything.

Chen Ping'an instructed, "I’ll be back soon. The child is fragile and has suffered some cold. Pay close attention to its breathing. When you use your spiritual energy to nurture the child’s body, be sure to exercise caution. If anything goes wrong, take the sword-raising gourd with you when you leave the ghost house and find a knowledgeable doctor at a pharmacy."

Du Yu nodded vigorously like a chick pecking at rice.

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, then twisted his wrist, producing the last remaining walnut. "After being thrown, its power is equivalent to a full-strength strike from an earth immortal. No incantation is needed; any Qi cultivator can use it. Even someone of the lower five realms, though weak, would only spit out a few mouthfuls of blood and exhaust their spiritual energy. There shouldn’t be any significant aftereffects. Besides, you are at the pinnacle of the cave realm, a martial artist; you can use it without worry."

Du Yu cradled the child in one arm, turning slightly to bend down and grasp the priceless celestial treasure.

His heart settled.

It was rare for his senior to be so chatty.

But for some reason, at this moment, his senior felt somewhat familiar.

Taking a deep breath, Chen Ping'an no longer held the sword immortal, instead slinging it across his back. "So you’re still enjoying yourselves, huh?"

Du Yu sighed, feeling that familiar sensation fading again.

He silently told himself to take this as his senior’s good intentions, helping him, Du Yu, to cultivate his heart.

His senior had already vanished.

No ripples of spiritual energy, no gentle breeze.

It was as if he had merged with the heavens and earth.

Du Yu held the child, gently rocking it, afraid of waking the little one. He had never been this tender with any Jianghu female heroes. Looking down, he murmured, "Little one, you’ve got more luck than you know."

In a narrow, deserted alley.

A man leaned against the wall, swallowing hard, feeling as if he had not been followed?

To earn that little amount of money, it was indeed hot to handle.

The contact he had with that ledger immortal may not have looked like someone who could provide small sums of money, but celestial money couldn’t be forged; without it, he would die. If he didn’t take it and behaved, what else could he do? He found a clerk from Sui Jia City with similar means, gave him a bag of silver, and not taking it would lead to death. The clerk wasn’t foolish and managed to find those two scoundrels from Ya'er Alley, leading to today’s events.

This mountain hermit took out the small sum of money, smiling as he whispered to himself. The ledger immortal truly didn’t treat money as money; he hoped for another deal like this.

A voice beside him said with a smile, "You’re doing well, not treating lives as lives."

The man stiffly turned to see the white-robed immortal standing just a few steps away, and he hadn’t even sensed it.

The man trembled, "Great Sword Immortal, I’m not impressive at all. I’m forced by circumstances to act. That Dream Liangfeng ledger immortal thinks such tasks are too dirty for his hands. He’s actually less concerned about the lives of ordinary people than I am."

He forced a smile, "This Great Sword Immortal, you might not know, but that woman from Ya'er Alley is born with a venomous heart, and her husband was a despicable wretch. Such common folk are limited by their lack of talent, forced to wallow in the mud. If they were cultivators, their misdeeds would be extraordinary."

The white-robed sword immortal smiled. "Not questioning conscience, only observing actions. Otherwise, how many could survive in this world? What do you think?"

The man nodded, "Yes, yes, yes, you’re right, Great Sword Immortal."

Then he heard the outsider, who could bear the heaven’s tribulation without dying, ask him in a tone of mild surprise, "A small ledger immortal from Dream Liangfeng feels too dirty to kill a few common folk. How do you think I, as a sword immortal, would feel killing you? If not for that, why wouldn’t I slay the beggar women seeking alms, the young ruffians pushing dung carts for fun, or that assassin hiding in the dung barrel?"

The man raised the small sum of money, bowing deeply, and raised his hands to flatter, "If the Great Sword Immortal thinks it’s dirty, then have a bit of mercy and spare me. Don’t let your divine weapon be tainted by someone as foul as me. I’m not worthy of you drawing your sword."

"Cultivation methods and celestial techniques abound in the mountains. Do you even need to draw your sword?"

After hearing this, the man broke out in a cold sweat, no longer daring to say another word.

"At this moment, do you see me as an evil person just like you, making you afraid?"

The immortal, with a flick of his folding fan, lightly tapped his own head, his demeanor lazy as he chuckled softly, "Evil people are silent before me, while good people stab backs behind their scenes. You all are the silent ones, yet you are also the ones who dance with joy. Strange, isn’t it?"

The man wanted to escape but was completely paralyzed, his limbs unresponsive.

The immortal said, "Come, shout loud enough for the whole city to hear, ‘The sword immortal has killed someone,’ and I might just spare you."

The man shook his head vigorously, forcing himself to speak with a trembling voice, "I dare not! I absolutely refuse to insult you, Great Sword Immortal!"

The immortal replied with a casual "Oh," followed by, "Then you’re in for a terrible fate." Before the wild cultivator could speak, he lightly tapped the man on the head with the folding fan, then waved his sleeve, gathering the man's three souls and seven spirits into his palm, slowly consuming them with his vital energy.

If all good people can only find solace for their suffering by aligning with evil people, then the world truly isn’t kind.

As for the small sum of money, it fell beside the corpse, finally rolling into a crack.

In white robes, the immortal slowly walked out of the alley.

A moment later, a beam of golden sword light shot up as the white-robed immortal soared away from Sui Jia City, heading straight for Cangyun Lake.

From the ghost house in the city, a flickering green sword followed closely behind.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 593: Everyone Just Grab the Sword (Part Two)

In the capital of Mengliang Kingdom, within the National Master's residence.

Two great cultivators sat facing each other across a small emerald-green lake. One was an old scholar in a blue robe, his white hair flowing like an unrecognized sage, while the other was a youthful man on the cusp of adulthood. The old scholar had a faintly breathing little monkey resting on his knees, while the young man had a seemingly asleep blue serpent coiled around his waist, its head and tail connected like a blue belt.

In the distance behind the scholar, a pale-faced fox enchantress stood. Though her beauty was average, her alluring gaze belied a hint of trepidation even as she stood behind her master, separated from the young man by the small lake. After all, the reputation of this "young man," named Xia Zhen, was fearsome. Once a wild cultivator who monopolized a vast mountain range, he never took on formal disciples, only raising a few promising servant boys. Later, he relinquished that land rich in spiritual energy, relocating an entire celestial abode through his extraordinary abilities, vanishing completely from the southeastern territories of Beiju Luzhou.

This powerful figure had made a secret pact with her master.

However, the fox enchantress could hardly have imagined that her master, who should have been secluded in the territories beyond those dozen nations, had unexpectedly transformed into the esteemed National Master of Mengliang Kingdom.

Years ago, according to reports from Yinpingshan, she had heard of the situation in Mengliang. Her master had first emerged as a "young prodigy" from a small cold clan in Mengliang, subsequently achieving high honors and entering the political arena. With extraordinary talent in poetry and governance, he became the youngest prime minister in the history of Mengliang, reaching a position of great power before abruptly resigning. Rumors suggested he had encountered an immortal who imparted Daoist magic to him, after which he vanished from public view, leading the entire nation to create countless heartfelt "People's Umbrellas."

After retreating to the mountains and focusing on alchemy and cultivation, he completed his celestial powers in just ten years. The fox enchantress had once dismissed it as a joke, mere trickery. Yet, the new emperor of Mengliang, who had recently ascended the throne, personally sought him out in the mountains, inviting him back to the capital and bestowing upon him the title of National Master. During his tenure, the nation prospered, and after his ascension, Mengliang flourished under his guidance, becoming a paradise where no one would dare to steal.

During the assassination attempt in Suijia City, the fox enchantress had lost two tails and suffered injuries to her cultivation base. However, after her master made an appearance, he merely brought her and her colleague to the National Master's residence in Mengliang, without any rewards or accolades, leaving her feeling somewhat despondent. Losing her esteemed status as the Empress of Yinpingshan and returning to her master as a lowly maid had made her uncomfortable.

Xia Zhen smiled and said, "Congratulations, my friend. Your long-held wish is about to come true. Establishing a sect is just around the corner."

The old scholar replied calmly, "I will remove the remaining restrictions of that golden thunder pool. The spiritual energy from outside will gradually flow in, and within a century, it will be a year of great abundance for budding cultivators. As for those like He Luoyan and Qing Yan, who are still young, they will have the first opportunity to seize the golden dan. If within your sect, we can have seven or eight golden dan earth immortals appearing simultaneously, it will be a solid foundation for establishing your sect—both of us can rejoice."

Xia Zhen's gaze turned sincere as he reflected, "Compared to your methods and schemes, I truly feel inadequate. To actually obtain this rare treasure of merit, and even a congenital sword pellet at that—truthfully, I thought there was at least a sixty percent chance that it would slip away."

Xia Zhen glanced at the little monkey, whose belly shimmered brightly, and felt a surge of admiration. This old fellow, who was on the verge of reaching golden dan, managed to remain incognito, avoiding the covetous eyes of various factions, and audaciously hid right under his nose, ultimately acquiring a treasure of merit that could benefit an entire nation. This level of cunning deserved the status of a Nascent Soul.

The old man chuckled, "You willingly exchanged a treasure of geomantic significance for this unregarded territory of a dozen nations. That is no small feat. As long as it is well managed, it will surely yield returns within a hundred years, and then reap profits for a thousand."

One sought treasures, while the other sought talents.

The cooperation between the two Nascent Souls had created this grand scheme.

In the end, it was a win-win situation.

However, both were acutely aware that as soon as one of them reached the upper five realms, the dynamics of the situation would undoubtedly change.

If one could indeed establish a sect, who among them would not feel their territory was too small?

Once the old man removed the thunder pool, causing the spiritual energy to flood into the dozen nations, Xia Zhen would certainly not sit idly by and watch that vast tide of spiritual energy dissipate, wasted on a swarm of ants fighting over scraps.

As for Fan Weiran and Ye Han, who had brought along a large group of useless followers, they had failed to seize the treasure from the fox enchantress and the old man. In truth, Xia Zhen was not particularly angry; that spiritual energy was the foundation of his Dao, the rest was simply not worth being greedy over. The original agreement between the two Nascent Souls was no child’s play, and besides, where in the world was there ever a good deal that came without cost? Since the situation was stable and prosperous, he could refine his treasure of merit and take risks to become a sword cultivator, while he would absorb his own spiritual energy, hoping to break through various bottlenecks and quickly ascend to the upper five realms. 

One must possess cleverness, but one could not rely solely on cleverness for a lifetime; a Nascent Soul should have the vision and mindset befitting one.

Xia Zhen seemed to recall something, "After the heavenly tribulation, I visited Suijia City and discovered something surprising."

The old scholar smiled, "Please, do share, my friend."

Xia Zhen placed his hands on the blue "belt," smiling, "If I am not mistaken, the sword that the foreign sword cultivator carried is a half-immortal weapon! I fight fiercely and have some skill, but unfortunately, my refining abilities are laughable. Since you are adept at refining, how about we form a contract and become allies this time?"

The old man's eyes sparkled, but the gleam faded in an instant.

If it were a magical artifact, he would have no interest. Right now, refining the treasure of merit contained within the congenital sword pellet was the foundation for his future rise to the upper five realms. He would feel pained even for a day’s delay.

But a half-immortal weapon? 

Yet, the old man quickly regained his composure.

Such a rare item, did Xia Zhen think he was his father or son to generously inform him? 

Thus, the old Nascent Soul, temporarily the National Master of Mengliang, waved his hand and laughed, "Take it, my friend. It’s about time you had this opportunity. As for me, I shall pass. Until I successfully refine this item, I must adhere to numerous restrictions. The trouble is vast, and you surely understand, with your cultivation level, it wouldn’t be difficult to kill an injured young sword cultivator. I wish you success in acquiring a half-immortal weapon!"

Xia Zhen nodded with a smile, finding the old man's caution unremarkable; both were wild cultivators of the Nascent Soul, having survived to this day without easily falling for traps. 

Those of them who committed violence without blinking had walked many a dark road; they still needed to fear ghosts every now and then.

This was a phrase Xia Zhen had etched in his heart since his youth, a lesson learned from the late wild cultivator master he had killed in his early days. Why had he been able to seize treasures so perilously back then? It was precisely because the master and disciple had inadvertently run into an iron wall.

Thus, over the years, whenever Xia Zhen felt overly pleased with himself, he would recite that old saying silently to remind himself.

Xia Zhen stood up, smiling, "There’s no need to see me off, my friend."

The old scholar gently picked up the little monkey, rising to send him off. "Rest assured, I shall be leaving Mengliang soon."

Xia Zhen transformed into a streak of light, disappearing into the distance, small as a mustard seed, breaking through a low-hanging cloud sea and wandering freely.

The National Master of Mengliang shook the little monkey in his hand and looked up with a laugh, "I didn't expect him to hold back, impressive for this Xia Zhen."

In the distance, the fox enchantress and the thin old man stood respectfully with their hands clasped.

The fox enchantress whispered, "Master, are you really going to let a half-immortal weapon go just like that? Although it means little to Xia Zhen, for you..."

The old scholar used his spatial powers to enclose the monkey into a small realm.

Turning to her, he said, "In this tiny Mengliang, where news is so restricted, I am far from Xia Zhen in terms of information. If you envy that half-immortal weapon, why not go and obtain it for me?"

The fox enchantress dared not utter a word, and even held her breath.

Her identity had already been exposed by Ye Han of Huangyue City; she was no longer the beauty who caused trouble in Yinpingshan. If she returned to Suijia City and exposed her whereabouts, she would be a rat crossing the street.

The old scholar scoffed, "An unyielding sword cultivator willing to face a heavenly tribulation, and a young man who dares to reveal a half-immortal weapon—are they really soft persimmons? If that were the case, would Xia Zhen not grasp the opportunity himself and instead kindly reveal this secret? Moreover, once a half-immortal weapon recognizes its master, especially after its owner dies, the aftermath can be catastrophic. You are all so naive, completely unaware of the gravity of the situation."

Amidst the clouds, Xia Zhen no longer zipped through the air but walked slowly, hands clasped behind his back.

He sighed, muttering to himself, "Since it's from Pima Sect, perhaps I should avoid provoking them."

Looking back at the capital of Mengliang, having obtained the congenital sword pellet and now a half-immortal weapon on the scene, such a destined fortune—could he truly resist? 

With such a timid heart, how could he call himself a wild cultivator? After spending decades as a mundane scholar in Mengliang, he had indeed cultivated his heart and mind quite well.

Xia Zhen extended a hand, listing a few names, just enough for one hand.

More than that would delay his own path.

Fan Weiran, easy to use; Ye Han, quite clever; He Lu, good aptitude; Yan Qing, not bad; and that green girl, a bit quirky.

He then raised his other hand, listing five names, all of which belonged to relatively young and low-ranking individuals.

Strolling on the cloud sea, Xia Zhen gazed at his two hands, gently forming fists. "Ten others’ golden dan are worth less than my own one in the jade purity realm? Better to just kill them all?"

However, Xia Zhen quickly shook his head. "Never mind, no rush. Let's leave five golden dan slots open. Whoever shows potential for the Nascent Soul, I’ll eliminate them to make room."

Pressing his hands on the blue belt, he thought, *This fellow is indeed remarkable. I never knew why he insisted that I suppress the martial fortunes of the dozen nations in our pact, forbidding the emergence of any golden body cultivators. It turns out it was to minimize conflicts and allow him, the covert prime minister and national master of Mengliang, to avoid creating bloodshed while accumulating merit.*

Stretching lazily, he recalled the scene of the heavenly tribulation.

The mood of this Nascent Soul wild cultivator grew serious.

Could it be one of the ten individuals who shared similarities with Liu Jinglong and Yang Ning? Yet upon closer inspection, none of them matched.

Xia Zhen halted, looking around with a smile, "I wonder which friend this is? Why do you dare not show yourself?"

At the edge of his vision, on the other side of the cloud sea, someone stood still, but the cloud sea beneath them suddenly surged like a wave, rushing towards Xia Zhen.

Unmoved, Xia Zhen lightly patted the now formidable blue serpent around his waist, smiling inwardly, *No need to pay attention. Close combat suits me just fine.*

The unexpected guest appeared somewhat travel-worn, visibly fatigued. As the cresting waves hit the shore, he floated down and approached, chatting amiably as if reuniting with an old friend, continuously complaining, "You lot really give me no peace of mind, making me rush back from the sea. Do you think I’m just your ferry service? And that’s not all, I almost got killed by that irritable little girl. Thankfully, my brother and I are still in sync, or I wouldn't have noticed the situation here. But still, I've arrived late, too late. My brother shouldn’t have retaliated against the woman who’s been so devoted to him. Alas, if he didn’t do this, he wouldn't be the brother I truly admire. And as for that woman’s devotion… well, it’s just a bit too much. No wonder my brother reacted as he did."

The man continued his endless rambling, "What’s the deal with the feng shui in your Northern Beiju Luzhou? Did I offend you or something? Can’t I just go back and live my life in peace? I’ve always been kind to everyone here, both on the mountain and in the valleys, I’m practically a model son-in-law to you all, so why treat me like this?"

His words were unfiltered and nonsensical.

Xia Zhen listened, utterly confused but not particularly concerned.

A person who has attained enlightenment would never reveal clues in their speech. Moreover, with such a fluent command of Northern Beiju Luzhou dialect, who could claim to be a foreign traveler?

This individual had a face like Zhang Sheng, unmistakably real, without any illusions—unless he was a mountain-top cultivator of the immortal realm, his illusions would not work on Xia Zhen, no matter how skilled he was.

The man’s cloud sea began to disperse beneath him.

His cultivation was not low, yet he enjoyed showing off such trivial skills.

Xia Zhen not only did not retreat but took a few slow steps forward, smiling as he asked, "May I ask your name, friend?"

The man hesitated for a moment, taking two steps back before replying, "My nickname is Zhou Fei, my formal name… well, I won't say it. I'm afraid you might have some female relatives or disciples."

What nonsense.

Xia Zhen remained calm, "I don't understand why you are blocking my path. What is the reason for this?"

The man, calling himself Zhou Fei, looked quite handsome, standing tall above the cloud sea.

He wore a forlorn expression and said, "I’m begging you to let me go, alright? Just let me return to Baopingzhou in peace? Hmm?!"

Xia Zhen sighed, an apologetic expression on his face, "If you keep making these absurd remarks, I won’t engage with you any longer."

Clearly using a pseudonym, Zhou Fei paused for a moment. "I’ve been so straightforward, and you still don’t understand? Damn it, if it weren’t for your Nascent Soul cultivation, how would you even think of playing mind games with my brother?"

Only then did Xia Zhen finally grasp the situation.

So, someone was here to help that young sword immortal regain his dignity?

Xia Zhen glanced around, clicking his tongue, "Just you, huh? Haven’t you heard? Within ten zhang, Xia Zhen can kill a Nascent Soul?"

Then the man jumped forward, landing within five zhang, seemingly seeking death, "Alright, now let me help you open your eyes, Jiang Shangzhen."

Xia Zhen nearly broke down right then and there.

The people of Northern Beiju Luzhou had always looked down upon others, particularly sword cultivators, who were notoriously arrogant, regarding everyone outside of Zhongtu Shenzhou as worthless. Their cultivation was worthless, their artifacts worthless, their backgrounds worthless—none were worthy of mention.

Yet there were a few outlandish individuals from distant continents that the Northern Beiju Luzhou folk would remember fondly, even taking the initiative to inquire about their circumstances after returning home.

Such as… the great sword immortal from the central and northern regions who vowed to personally kill him… Jiang Shangzhen of Tongyezhou!

Inside the Dragon Palace of Cangjun Lake.

Another grand gathering was underway.

Lord Yin, the lake ruler, didn’t sit on the steps beneath the dragon throne this time, but instead stood between both parties and said, "I just received word via sword transmission that someone is coming toward us on their flying sword."

Except for Fan Weiran, who was sneering, and Ye Han, who stood immovable like a mountain, still somewhat shocked alongside the golden boy and girl, the rest of the assembly was in an uproar.

Lord Yin's expression darkened. "Ye Han, my esteemed City Lord, who was it that said this foreign sword immortal was heavily injured and would be easy prey for us to wear down? We’re barely even set up, and he’s already made it to our Cangjun Lake stronghold. What now? Shall we scatter and flee, each getting picked off one by one, or stay here, nursing our knees and waiting to kneel and beg for mercy?"

He Lu, calm and composed, stood up holding a bamboo flute. "One formation is set up outside Suijia City, another here at Cangjun Lake, in addition to the mountain and water formations protecting the Dragon Palace. I believe we should open our gates and let him enter the formation. With our three factions working together, with our City Lord present, and Elder Fan, plus two formations and over a hundred cultivators filling the hall, we would be equivalent to the strength of an immortal. If he doesn’t come, he’ll only shrink back into Suijia City, and we’ll lose our bait and damage our relations. If he does come, isn’t that even better?"

Lord Yin grew furious. "What a lighthearted comment, He Xiaoxian! This Cangjun Lake is my family’s business accumulated over a millennium. You lot could only ruin a few divine artifacts. If it turns into a chaotic battlefield, with corpses strewn everywhere and the Dragon Palace collapsing, even if we manage to win, slaughtering the enemy, if we still divide the spoils as previously agreed, won’t I end up losing the Dragon Palace for nothing and weep in despair?"

He Lu smiled brightly. "Cangjun Lake takes two shares, Baotong Wonderland takes four, and Huangyue City takes four. This was the previous agreement. Now, we can offer one share to compensate the lake ruler. Moreover, as per the old rules, if anyone has their eye on a particular artifact and wishes to have it, we will first calculate a fair price that all three parties can trust, converting it into Xuehua coins or Xiaoshu coins, plus a premium, as thanks for the sacrifices of the other two parties."

At this point, He Lu glanced across, her gaze drifting to the woman who seemed to be longing for something, then smiled at the old woman. "Elder Fan?"

Initially appearing half-asleep, the elder smiled softly, "Certainly, we from Baotong Wonderland are also willing to offer one share of our profits as reward for the Cangjun Lake Dragon Palace."

Lord Yin turned to Ye Han, who nodded gently.

Only then did Lord Yin appear satisfied.

He Lu ceased her speech.

Everyone in the Dragon Palace of Cangjun Lake looked at the handsome youth, exuding radiance and charm, with admiration and reverence.

If this lad were not from Huangyue City and the position of City Lord had always been passed down to those of the same surname, how could the two useless sons of Ye Han contend for anything against He Lu?

On the side of the hall, just past the ornate curtain hung with pearls, a beautiful woman gently lifted the edge of the curtain, her gaze brimming with affection as she looked at the charming young man who spoke with a smile. 

Such an outstanding young man existed in the world!

The formerly scruffy scholars and noble offspring seemed to pale in comparison to this He Lang of Huangyue City.

He was truly like a handsome immortal, stepping right out of the pages of ancient history and literature.

In the ghostly residence of Suijia City.

Du Yu cradled the still-sleeping infant in swaddling, feeling helpless.

Suddenly, Du Yu turned sharply, noticing a tall, handsome man vaulting over the wall, landing lightly before performing a stance to gather his qi.

Du Yu sprang to his feet, facing a formidable opponent, glancing at the crimson wine jug on the chair, and surprisingly did not draw his sword.

Despair washed over him.

He tightly gripped the walnut given by his predecessor before setting off.

The man raised both hands, smiling, "No need to be tense, no need to be tense. I’m Zhou Fei, a good friend of Chen… he’s using that name now, isn’t he? In any case, I’m his sworn brother, and since I noticed this ruckus, although my cultivation isn’t high, a brother in trouble is a brother in need, so I hurried over to see if you need any help. Thankfully, your place is easy to find. Where’s my brother? And who are you?"

Du Yu felt skeptical.

The man pointed to the wine jug on the chair. "There are two flying swords inside; one has gone out, and the other is here to protect you. If I weren’t recognized, would it remain hidden to protect you?"

Du Yu believed a fraction of it but remained cautious.

The man glanced at the walnut in Du Yu's hand. "Alright, that walnut is indeed astonishing, equivalent to a single strike from an earth immortal, right? It can certainly smash someone, but don’t use it to intimidate my brother; my skin is thinner than my face, and I’d rather not get accidentally killed. What’s your name? You look impressive, with the demeanor of a top-notch expert. No wonder my brother trusts you to guard the house… huh? What’s this? In just a few days, my brother has even had a child?! Quite impressive, isn’t it? Makes one envious."

Du Yu felt his face stiffening. Why did this person’s unhinged words seem strangely charming? He reminded him of a friend of his predecessor.

The man quickly trotted over to Du Yu, who was torn between action and inaction, and placed the chair further away, sitting down with a thud.

Du Yu carefully sat on another bamboo chair, solemnly declaring, "I’m Du Yu, a cultivator from the Ghost Axe Palace, and I’ve been tasked with watching over this child by my predecessor."

The man named Zhou Fei instantly gave a thumbs up, his face full of admiration. "The Ghost Axe Palace, renowned! I’ve long admired it!"

Du Yu asked, "Are you truly a friend of my predecessor?"

Zhou Fei laughed. "Absolutely true, no fakes here."

Du Yu would not dare to fully trust him.

Zhou Fei grinned, "Doesn’t your brother prefer… reason and rules? And at first, you probably didn’t take those seriously, thinking they were rather nonsensical, right?"

Du Yu felt a burden lift from his heart, his entire demeanor relaxing.

Du Yu wondered, "You’ve really heard of us from the Ghost Axe Palace?"

Zhou Fei nodded. "Didn’t you just introduce yourself? With a master like you guarding here, I naturally have to show some respect."

Du Yu let out a bitter laugh. "Since you’re a friend of my predecessor, you must be an extraordinary individual. There’s no need to mock me."

However, Zhou Fei replied, "You’re not an expert? Do you know that your so-called predecessor, my good brother, hardly ever trusts outsiders? This ‘outsider’ status may even be unnecessary; he probably doesn’t even trust himself. So Du Yu, I’m genuinely curious—what have you done or said to earn his admiration?"

Du Yu shook his head. "I’ve merely done a few minor things. It’s likely that my predecessor foresaw something good in me that I hadn’t even noticed."

The man was stunned for a long moment, holding back his words, then finally said, "Damn it, you’re my mortal enemy in the struggle for the Dao, aren’t you?"

But he quickly shook his head. "Never mind, for now, I’ll just treat you as a fellow traveler in the same path."

Then the man stood up, seemingly in a huff, and before he knew it, he was right in front of Du Yu, gently lifting a corner of the swaddling cloth and, after a quick calculation, nodded to himself, murmuring, "Taking away a minor cause and effect is no bother; it’ll help him avoid some unnecessary troubles. It’s unreasonable for a wanderer to travel with a little orphan; how would he win the favor of the fairies? At this point, I can only do this much. This child has some potential for cultivation; he’ll be fine. Just hope he doesn’t have money. Little one, consider it your good fortune from your past life, meeting us brothers one after another."

Unknowingly, Du Yu's hands relaxed, and that child was taken away by Zhou Fei.

Du Yu jolted, instinctively trying to wrestle the child back.

His life, his wealth, and the safety of his parents and sect lay in this small house.

The man smiled, "Alright, just tell my brother that this little one, I, Zhou Fei, will take him to Baopingzhou and settle him down, so he can travel without worry."

Du Yu's eyes reddened, wanting to snatch the child back. There was no reason to just take him away!

The man pointed a finger, freezing Du Yu in place. He blinked. "Have you heard of Jiang Shangzhen? The character for ginger and the character for honoring, and the character for true and false."

Du Yu nearly got wrapped up in the words, both fearful and furious, and suddenly realized, shouting, "I am Jiang Shangzhen! Give me back my child!"

The man gently covered the swaddling to avoid waking the child, then gave Du Yu a thumbs up. "Well done, even better than that Summer Zhen who could fight and flee, barely matching me in my prime. My brother really has an eye for talent in you."

Du Yu really had never heard of Jiang Shangzhen.

But the next moment, Jiang Shangzhen expanded his knowledge. With a flick of his wrist, he produced a golden military armor pill, gently tossing it toward Du Yu, perfectly landing on the now-immobile Du Yu's head, "Since you are a top-notch expert of the military, I’ll gift you a piece of golden crow armor that fits your status."

Then the man looked at Du Yu with pity in his eyes. "You Ghost Axe Palace certainly don’t have any beautiful fairies, am I right?"

Du Yu’s mind went blank.

The man disappeared into thin air.

Silently.

With a snap of his fingers, Du Yu felt his body return to normal.

He caught the golden military armor pill, feeling its weight.

What was the meaning of this?

Du Yu felt as if he were dreaming.

After all, fortune and misfortune are hard to predict; even holding a precious item in his hands, unease still gripped him.

Back at the Dragon Palace of Cangjun Lake, Lord Yin was the first to exclaim, "This is bad!"

Ye Han and Fan Weiran exchanged glances.

Then Yan Qing suddenly looked up at the main entrance.

He Lu, who had been smiling at her, followed Yan Qing's gaze and looked toward the palace entrance.

First, the entire Dragon Palace began to tremble violently.

Then, a figure in white descended gracefully on a flying sword, holding a scabbard in hand. After landing, he stepped over the threshold of the palace, and the long sword returned to its sheath on its own.

Finally, a sound like thunder echoed through the lake, trailing behind him.

The young man in white wore a smile as he walked without pause, lightly pushing the scabbard forward, tossing the long sword out, which pierced into the ground at an angle, standing there.

As he stood with elegance, his white sleeves fluttering, one hand behind his back and the other reaching for the sword on the ground, everyone heard him say with a smile, "Take your pick."

However, the next sentence made their hearts drop, "If you fail to take the sword, then leave your head."

The third sentence, however, eased the tension slightly.

Except for one individual, also dressed in white—a young man, He Lu.

"He Lu comes first."

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 594: The Divine High Seat

He Lu's face was ashen.

At the head of the Baodong Fairyland's Qi practitioners was the old matriarch Fan Weiran, alongside various affiliated cultivators, all showing complex expressions. Logically speaking, witnessing such a rare spectacle should have been a great amusement; however, they feared that after enjoying the show, they might end up becoming part of it.

As for the Qi practitioners from Huangyue City, Ye Han's group, they looked indignant, yet none dared to voice their grievances.

Both groups of cultivators were filled with deep resentment towards Cangyun Lake. What kind of nonsense was this Dragon Palace's great formation? Was it as easy to break as cutting tofu or slicing clay?!

The Lake Lord Yin Hou remained silent, standing still with his gaze lowered, focused on the ground. This was intriguing; a wealthy family had smashed a yellow mud wall, but they still shouted for attention. Meanwhile, their own Dragon Palace formation had been breached, resulting in a significant loss of heavenly wealth, and yet this Lake Lord didn’t even seem to care? Wasn’t Cangyun Lake supposed to be the pinnacle of the Silver Screen Kingdom? Within the nation, the mountain deities and the high-ranking officials all held great respect for Cangyun Lake. Even the Lake Lord, who swaggered about in an imperial dragon robe, had never faced any scrutiny.

Thus, the lower the realm, the more irritable one became. There were indeed those who wanted to step forward and reprimand the young sword immortal, who was surrounded from all sides. However, these aspiring cultivators, who initially sought to stand out, hoped to cultivate a relationship with He Lu and Ye Han from Huangyue City for free blessings. But before they could speak, their prudent companions—be they senior disciples or friends in the path—warned them through subtle gestures. Ultimately, those who kindly reminded others feared being dragged down by reckless individuals. A sword immortal whose swordsmanship could withstand heavenly tribulations might inadvertently kill a few people with a mere flash of his sword light.

Fan Weiran no longer wore a cold smile; she looked somewhat dull.

The city lord of Huangyue City, Ye Han, turned and asked the white-clad sword immortal, “Must the sword immortal pursue to the bitter end, seeking mutual destruction before he is willing to relent?”

The white-clad sword immortal casually thrust his sword sheath into the ground, retrieved a folding fan from his waist, and without glancing at either Ye Han or He Lu, began lightly tapping his palm with the fan, a broad smile on his face. His gaze drifted, starting from an elderly white-haired man seated cross-legged on his right, moving downward from the high seat to those closer to the entrance of the Dragon Palace, scrutinizing each one. “I’ve heard that a certain immortal from Dream Liang Peak has a rather innovative idea, even inviting a martial master to eat shit in a latrine. Who is it? Stand up and let me admire you. If you’re too lazy to rise, just raise your hand.”

At Baodong Fairyland, a pair of young sword-wielding men and women exchanged glances.

Wasn’t this sword immortal the same one they’d seen earlier that morning, eating pancakes and porridge at a roadside stall outside of Suijia City? His attire had changed, his demeanor transformed, but that face was unmistakable!

The woman wryly smiled, realizing her junior brother had the worst luck. The old man with a monkey on his shoulder at the city gate was the one who had stolen that heavenly treasure. Now this young wanderer had metamorphosed into a sudden sword immortal!

Chen Pingan’s gaze finally settled on a group of Qi practitioners positioned centrally. 

One man, situated closest to the palace entrance, withdrew his neck slightly.

Having asked the question, there was no need for a reply. The answer would reveal itself. Many mountain cultivators preferred to keep their lives untroubled, avoiding entanglement in the disputes of others.

Back at the city god temple's entrance, the shared subtle movements of those present when asked who the head of the Yin-Yang Division was had been quite decisive.

Now it was the same.

Chen Pingan raised a hand, and a ball of black mist, initially the size of a fist, had been worn down by his vigor to the size of a jujube pit. He gently spun it with a finger, strands of vigor wrapping around it like a millstone grinding, and smiled as he asked, “This wild cultivator whose name I’ve forgotten, you claim that your Dream Liang Peak’s immortal is the true mastermind behind this? I know you may lack the wit and courage for this, so tell me, is it that Lord Ye of Huangyue City or you, He Lu?”

The four Qi practitioners from Dream Liang Peak gritted their teeth in anger but remained seated like boulders.

Chen Pingan smiled, “If you don’t want to say, then don’t. I’m just curious, did the scheming Ye Han of Huangyue City or the clever He Lu provide you with any silver? If not, then Huangyue City isn’t being very generous.”

He Lu slowly stood up, her expression returning to normal, and declared loudly, “One person does the deed, one person takes the blame! Don’t shout about ‘He Lu was here first.’ All grievances related to Suijia City end with me. If I die, it’s naturally because the sword immortal is superior. I, He Lu, have no regrets. What do you think, sword immortal?”

Ye Han smiled faintly.

If they didn’t gamble like this, the assembly at Cangyun Lake today would be like scattered sand, with hearts divided, and on paper, it would equate to a trifecta of celestial forces dissipating into a mob.

Fan Weiran was somewhat surprised, lifting her gaze. This was the first time the old ancestor of Baodong Fairyland looked favorably upon the youth from Huangyue City.

Previously, she had considered He Lu merely a brilliant, capable young cultivator—no less than her own Yan girl. She had never anticipated that in the face of life and death, He Lu could remain so composed. This was quite remarkable.

One could say such a person, with thunder in their chest yet calm as a lake, was worthy of being called a general.

Wasn’t this the youth in question?

Such a cultivator, possessing both talent and character, if they didn’t meet an untimely end, the path ahead would be promising! Ye Han was indeed fortunate to have such a helper.

The old matriarch secretly pondered.

Could it be that after this banquet at Cangyun Lake, once they passed this crisis, she might as well agree to the union between Yan girl and him? After all, He Lu was an outsider, destined to inherit neither Huangyue City nor have a share in it. Perhaps she could leverage Yan girl to bring her into Baodong Fairyland. This could benefit both parties, infuriate Ye Han, and advance her own sect’s standing. If this pair of enviable golden boy and jade girl became heavenly companions and both reached the Golden Core realm, Huangyue City, which was already struggling, would be held together only by Ye Han. She believed that provided the conditions were right, by then, most of the mountains across a dozen nations would likely become the domain of Baodong Fairyland. Given this youth’s insight and vision, he would surely understand how to balance the accounts.

“Ye Han, as long as this person says something inappropriate, it will provoke public wrath. We must not miss the opportunity that He Lu has worked so hard to earn.”

Thus, Fan Weiran immediately conveyed to Ye Han through thought, “Today, we should put aside past grievances and work together sincerely! Let’s not hide anything. The situation is dire; we can’t afford to harbor our own thoughts.”

Ye Han decisively agreed.

“I thought you would say something about sparing others when you can. However, from this, it can be seen that the true mastermind behind Suijia City’s many schemes is indeed you, He Lu.”

Chen Pingan smiled, “Since you, He Lu, are so responsible, I respect you as a man. Fine, let this end with you. If I can’t take the sword, then here at Cangyun Lake’s Dragon Palace, I will only take your head.”

He Lu was stunned.

Not just her, even Fan Weiran felt a hint of relief.

The sword immortal’s reply was utterly unexpected. However, if killing were to occur today, as long as it was kept to a minimum, even if more were slain, as long as it didn’t involve too many from Baodong Fairyland, Fan Weiran would welcome it. The earlier secret agreement with Ye Han and Huangyue City would be rendered void.

Ye Han’s expression shifted slightly.

Chen Pingan pointed to the sword that was slanted in the ground, “He Lu, don’t be polite. Just take your sword. After your death, how many cultivators will remember your kindness? That counts as dying in a worthy cause.”

He Lu couldn't contain her expression, her gaze slightly shifting to her master, Ye Han.

From behind the beaded curtain at the side door of the main hall, a beautiful woman emerged, angrily saying, “You! You are truly overbearing. Why are you being so domineering? So what if you are a sword immortal feared by everyone? As a cultivator, how can you go to such extremes…”

As the beaded curtain was lifted and fell, it made a sound like pearls rolling. 

Lake Lord Yin Hou, filled with fury, didn’t even turn around, sweeping his sleeve forcefully, “Get back!”

With a single sweep, he sent that dragon maiden crashing through the beaded curtain with a loud bang, presumably smashing into the wall beyond, as there was no second sound, indicating that her delicate form had likely sunk into the wall.

This move from Lake Lord Yin Hou was no light gesture; it carried considerable weight.

Chen Pingan turned to the lake lord, smiling as he looked around, “What a nice place.”

Lake Lord Yin Hou bowed respectfully, “Sword immortal, your presence graces my humble abode, turning this simple dwelling into a splendid place.”

Chen Pingan tapped his folding fan twice and said, “At the Shao Creek Water God Temple, once, at Cangyun Lake, you and I had a friendly spar. Another time, we gathered heroes at the Dragon Palace to engage in a distant exchange of Dao. Once more, as the old saying goes, things should not exceed three occurrences. Adding this righteous dragon maiden who speaks the truth, this is the fourth time. What now?”

Lake Lord Yin Hou did not stand upright but merely raised his head slightly, solemnly stating, “What does the sword immortal suggest? The Dragon Palace of Cangyun Lake will comply!”

The white-clad sword immortal did not confirm or deny, understanding the situation, “The lake lord should not be hasty. Let’s wait until He Lu draws her sword before discussing it. If she draws it, wouldn’t you be caught off guard again? If you cast aside these words that chill your allies’ hearts now, it will affect the future distribution of wealth from your Dragon Palace, resulting in a significant loss of heavenly wealth.”

Lake Lord Yin Hou’s eyes were filled with pity as he forced a smile, “Sword immortal, you are truly amusing.”

Chen Pingan pointed to the elderly white-haired man sitting beside He Lu, “It’s your turn to step in and remedy the crisis. If you don’t speak up to stabilize hearts and turn the tide, it will be too late.”

Ye Han sighed softly.

The man who had just received secret teachings from the city lord found himself in a position where he didn’t know whether to sit or stand.

Ultimately, he lost most of his bravado and stood up stiffly, “Then allow this old fellow nearing the grave to dare to exchange a few words with the sword immortal?”

Yet, within the Dragon Palace’s main hall, they only heard the sword immortal softly utter the word, “Pity,” as if his expression was somewhat unsatisfied?

The behavior and speech of the sword immortal truly defied comprehension.

Yan Qing turned her head, noticing that the naive-looking girl next to her was secretly tugging at her sleeve.

Yan Qing quietly extended a finger, signaling the girl, who was usually unrestrained in speech within the sect, to remain silent.

The girl smiled knowingly, nodding gently, communicating through subtle thoughts with Yan Qing, “Aunt Yan, he’s just doing a little meditation. It’s rather strange; even I can only see a vague outline, like… a woodcutter sharpening his axe. But it seems he’s dissatisfied with our small number; the sharpening stone isn’t big enough. There’s a hazy outline of a city. Perhaps he’s thinking of the countless citizens of Suijia City… Anyway, that’s the general idea. This guy is truly cunning! Earlier at Cangyun Lake, he deliberately used a few silly snakes to temper his physique. Now he’s back again. Sigh, Aunt Yan, you know I’ve always admired the kind of sword immortal that our second ancestor often praises. But now, I dare not admire him; it’s terrifying.”

Yan Qing felt utterly bewildered, her heart increasingly weary.

This was a chaotic state of mind she had never encountered since her cultivation began.

The secret methods used by her sect to conceal one’s true self were of no use, nor was her own technique for calming her mind effective.

The white-clad sword immortal suddenly muttered, as if feeling somewhat helpless, “Alright, if you say it’s fine, then let’s treat it as being fine.”

This person, though not as handsome as He Lu, was unable to withstand the fact that he was a sword immortal with boundless killing power.

At this moment, the assembly in the Dragon Palace had grown tense, suspicion hanging in the air. They all felt that the white-clad immortal’s every word and action carried deep significance; this young sword immortal… truly lived up to the title.

Chen Pingan turned to the elderly white-haired man, who had been gathering his words, “It’s best to remain silent.”

A streak of emerald sword light suddenly appeared, and the old man’s expression changed dramatically. He stomped his foot, shook his sleeves, and transformed into a paper kite the size of a palm, beginning to flee in all directions.

The flying sword followed closely behind.

The route taken by the white paper kite was quite strategic. After attempting to dart out of the palace door and getting a hole pierced through its wing by the flying sword, it began to flit across the banquet tables, weaving among the stumbling Qi practitioners and the cups and bowls scattered on the tables, using them as obstacles against the flying sword, like a nimble little bird flitting through flowers, constantly threading the needle. This made the Qi practitioners turn pale with fear, yet they dared not curse openly in front of Huangyue City and Ye Han, feeling both infuriated and stifled. They resented this old fool for not dying.

Chen Pingan looked at He Lu, “This is the last reminder for you to draw your sword.”

He Lu remained silent, her grip on the bamboo flute tightening, veins bulging.

Ye Han slowly stood up, amiable, asking, “Though the sword immortal claims to be unharmed, we have indeed disturbed your tranquility during this time. Therefore, could we from Huangyue City take the lead, and I, Ye Han, personally step forward to help the sword immortal make amends?”

The young sword immortal smiled and nodded, “Of course. The city god of Suijia City once said, there’s nothing that can’t be discussed amicably under heaven.”

He reached out to grasp the sword in his hand, effortlessly drawing it. “Speak then, name your price.”

The sword immortal's actions were utterly unexpected, as he drew his sword in a flash. By the time he flicked his wrist and sheathed the sword, everyone failed to comprehend the significance of this act.

The city lord of Huangyue City, known for his grace and composure across several nations, suddenly erupted in anger, “You audacious brat! How dare you kill in front of me!”

Everyone raised their heads in unison, their gazes finally landing on the handsome youth covering his neck with his hands.

The heavenly bamboo flute had fallen to the ground, shattering like pearls.

He Lu stumbled back a few steps, blood seeping through her fingers, while the once noble young immortal now had tears streaming down his face. One hand clutched his neck, the other reaching toward Ye Han, he whimpered in a trembling voice, “Father, save me, save me…”

Fan Weiran felt a chill in her heart, followed by a stinging slap as if she had been struck hard. 

She was nearly so enraged that her hair stood on end, ready to fling away the crown gifted by the immortal!

What a piece of work He Lu was! What a piece of work Ye Han was! What a pair of father and son who had plotted against cultivators across dozens of nations!

If she and Baodong Fairyland truly entertained the notion of bringing Yan Qing and He Lu together as a couple, then considering the cunning of these two, wouldn’t she be sending meat buns to a dog?

Yan Qing was merely a simple girl devoted to her cultivation, uninterested in worldly affairs. How could she possibly compare to this duo, who had been hiding their identities as father and son?

Even hypothetically speaking, if Yan Qing didn’t help He Lu deal with Baodong Fairyland, she would still end up with a broken Dao heart. Even if she respected her master and wanted to help her sect fight Huangyue City, Yan Qing would be powerless!

Fan Weiran downed her cup of wine, laughing loudly, “What a joy! He Lu, the wretched scoundrel, truly deserves to die! Ye Han, you’ve lost your beloved son, yet you hold back your hatred to compete with the sword immortal?! You can’t even avenge your son? If it were me, I’d die here at the Cangyun Lake Dragon Palace!”

Chen Pingan smiled, “You’ll die too; don’t be in a hurry to be reborn.”

Fan Weiran’s laughter abruptly ceased.

He Lu saw Ye Han about to reach out but then retracting his hand. A sense of despair and grief filled her heart, her vision blurring as she fixed her gaze on her father, who was reluctant to act. The youth’s eyes were filled with hatred. Then, slowly turning, blood continued to seep through his fingers as he looked at the terrified Yan Qing, his gaze turning pleading, “Yan Qing, save me.”

Yan Qing exhaled a breath of foul air, grasping the short sword, standing up, and turning to the white-clad sword immortal, “This time I draw my sword, it’s only for myself.”

The white-clad sword immortal stood with his hands behind his back, nodding with a smile, “Seeking kindness, you will find kindness; seeking death, you will find death. At last, this polluted Dragon Palace has produced a decent cultivator.”

Yan Qing stood with the short sword, her smile radiant. As her state of mind returned to clarity, her spiritual energy flowed, and the crown atop her head shimmered, making this stunning beauty appear even more ethereal.

Yet, while it looked beautiful, all the Qi practitioners in the Dragon Palace felt utterly confused.

He Lu staggered back, ultimately leaning against the wall, collapsing to the ground in despair.

At last, a head rolled and fell to the ground.

The sound was far lesser than the earlier thunderous clamor, yet it struck the hearts of all cultivators like a heavy hammer, leaving them breathless.

Huangyue City’s He Lu had perished just like that.

A genius in cultivation who once had the potential to stand side by side with Ye Han and Fan Weiran at the mountain peak had just met a tragic end?

Looking at the enchanting immortal Yan Qing, astonishment filled the hall.

They were both among the most outstanding prodigies in a dozen nations.

He Lu was such a refined and clever person, yet he had simply fallen short in luck, dying in this foreign land’s Cangyun Lake Dragon Palace. But this immortal Yan Qing, who clearly had the opportunity to distance herself, how could she be so foolish?

How had this pair, who were almost destined to be celestial lovers, come together in the first place? 

Or was it that their feelings ran deep, and upon seeing her beloved die, Yan Qing, in her rage, drew her sword?

But confronting a genuine sword immortal with a sword was not something they looked down upon; it was merely self-humiliation.

At that crucial moment when Yan Qing was gathering her strength to draw her sword, the young sword immortal met her gaze.

An anomaly occurred!

Near Ye Han’s central seat, a table laden with delicacies suddenly exploded, sending Qi practitioners flying to both sides and crashing into one another.

A robust figure radiating golden light burst through the table without warning. With a single step, the entire Dragon Palace trembled, and then with a punch, the white-clad sword immortal was sent flying, crashing through the wall. Not only that, but the sound of the wall breaking continued to resound.

Was this punch truly something a mere fifth-realm Qi practitioner from Dream Liang Peak could deliver?

Fan Weiran and Ye Han exchanged shocked glances, both recognizing the astonishment and fear in each other's eyes.

This person had concealed his true nature so deeply; he was certainly not a pawn of either side!

He might even be the real accomplice of that old man raising monkeys and the queen of the Silver Screen Kingdom!

This surprise attack, if unprepared, would leave both of them severely injured, unable to withstand it even as Golden Core cultivators.

The seemingly unremarkable man, after delivering a peak punch filled with his entire life's martial intent, was left with a shattered arm hanging limply. Yet, his heroic spirit surged as he regarded the crowd of cultivators as mere chickens and dogs. He laughed heartily, “This killer punch was originally meant for that old thief Xia Zhen. I never expected it would be snatched by this arrogant young fool.”

The man, passing through walls as if they had been opened, looked towards the dust-filled distance. “They say this sword immortal is unreasonable, possessing a physique of the Golden Body realm. Now what? Are you still a Golden Body? My punch, even a true Golden Body martial artist would have their five organs smashed and guts splattered, dying on the spot!”

He spat out a mouthful of blood, glancing at the sword lying on the ground, “What a pathetic sword immortal! What a joke! I’ve endured you long enough! One sword down and you’ve killed a mere Sea Viewing realm chick, thinking you’re invincible?”

Lake Lord Yin Hou’s lips curled upward, and the grin widened until his entire face was filled with joy.

Fan Weiran also began to laugh.

Only Ye Han, though relieved, couldn’t bring himself to smile when he glanced at the headless corpse against the wall, his mood soured.

Fortunately, this concealed identity of a son was ultimately a cultivator of the Golden Body realm, already gathering his soul within several key energy centers.

But such a fine innate body, possessing the so-called qualities of the immortal, would be impossible to find again. How would he ascend to the Golden Core realm in the future? Or even surpass himself, leading Huangyue City to greater heights?

The other three Qi practitioners from Dream Liang Peak swallowed hard.

This wasteful junior brother, who could barely fight back, had suddenly transformed into a top-notch master, striking like thunder!

Yan Qing stood dazed.

In the hall, even knowing that this legendary master of the Golden Body realm was an enemy rather than a friend, cheers began to erupt. Many began clapping and cheering, while some raised wine pots, drinking deeply, giving a thumbs-up to that pure martial artist. Others began praising that the Dream Liang Kingdom was not only flourishing in literature but also thriving in martial prowess. They should long have become a dominant force, swallowing nearby nations, perhaps even establishing a great dynasty.

Standing amidst the noisy and festive hall, Yan Qing felt empty inside.

How could this happen?

She felt lost.

Fan Weiran laughed so hard her body leaned back. The old matriarch imitated the crude martial cultivator, raising her thumb towards Yan Qing, “Yan girl, you’ve done a remarkable deed! Good girl, when you return to Baodong Fairyland, you must receive a prized treasure from the Ancestor Hall. I want to see who dares to disagree!”

The first to sense something amiss was that blinking girl.

At this moment, she didn’t dare even to make a small movement, let alone use her spiritual sense.

The naive girl began to sit up straight, becoming like a wooden statue.

Then it was the martial artist from Dream Liang Kingdom, who had secretly climbed to the Golden Body realm step by step.

As this man’s expression grew serious, Ye Han and Fan Weiran also realized the situation was not looking good.

The lake lord Yin Hou, who had wanted to befriend this martial artist, also started withdrawing his smile, quickly focusing his energy.

A white-clad sword immortal walked through "one door after another," ultimately appearing in the hall.

The Qi practitioner positioned centrally at Fan Weiran’s side had long rolled and crawled, urgently clearing a path for the sword immortal and that Golden Body realm master.

The sword immortal patted his shoulder, shook his white sleeves, and with a smile said, “Earlier on the ferry, someone claimed your Golden Core Qi practitioners were made of paper.” He slowly approached the martial artist from Dream Liang Kingdom, showing no sign of the “shattered organs” he had mentioned. 

As he walked, he laughed, “Now I see your Golden Body martial artist isn’t any better; you’re made of mud, or perhaps you’re just the kind that hasn’t dried yet, which is why you broke your own arm? Does it hurt?”

The man spoke in a deep voice, “You’re actually a martial artist of the Far Travel realm! Am I right? You aren’t a sword immortal at all, correct? Before you throw a punch, give me a clear answer!”

The sword immortal pressed one hand against his abdomen, the other hand to his forehead, his face filled with helplessness, “Brother, don’t be like that. Really, after all these jokes you’ve shared in the Dragon Palace, I’m lucky not to have been crushed by heavenly tribulation in Suijia City, yet now I’m about to be killed by laughter here.”

Lake Lord Yin Hou sighed, sitting on the steps, cradling his head in his hands. Well, he resigned himself. Let them fight as they wish; if they ruin the Dragon Palace, as long as I frown, in the future, I’ll share a surname with that sword immortal.

Some young cultivators, who had earlier wanted to cry but didn’t dare, now wanted to laugh but also held back.

The white-clad sword immortal turned to Fan Weiran and Lake Lord Yin Hou, “I possess the physique of a Golden Body martial artist, is that what you’ve spread around? Do you know that because of this misunderstanding, many of my plans have fallen through?”

The man took a deep breath, smiled, and stood his ground, raising the only usable arm, striking a stance filled with complete martial intent, “It doesn’t matter whether you’re a martial artist of the same realm or a flying sword immortal; I will face you once more.”

Chen Pingan glanced at the other three cultivators from Dream Liang Peak before retracting his gaze, smiling, “It seems your Dream Liang Kingdom hides dragons and crouching tigers; this is interesting. Thank you.”

The man took a step forward, his martial intent flooding like a torrent, causing the entire palace to tremble, nearly lifting all the tables. Just when everyone thought another deadly showdown was imminent, the man leaned back, as swift as thunder, crashing into the wall behind him that hadn't yet "opened," shattering it, as if employing the immortal's divine ability to compress vast mountains into mere inches, vanishing without a trace.

No wonder a martial artist of the Golden Body realm hadn’t been seen in two hundred years; his movements were indeed elusive, leaving people defenseless.

Yet, within the hall, the white-clad sword immortal was also nowhere to be seen.

Then, from the newly opened wall, the legendary martial artist of the Golden Body realm stepped back, one step at a time.

Only a large sleeve and hand protruded from the man’s chest.

Not only did it instantly block the path of this martial arts grandmaster, but it also determined life and death; the sword immortal directly pierced the man’s chest and back with a single left hand!

The white-clad sword immortal raised his right hand, pressing against the man’s head, and gently pushed.

The man flew back effortlessly, landing squarely in the center of the hall.

With a flick of his sleeve, a spray of bright red blood splattered across the ground.

And above the hall, that paper kite was still frantically trying to escape, avoiding the emerald sword light trailing behind.

Chen Pingan smiled, “Still not done playing?”

The emerald glowing flying sword suddenly accelerated, turning the paper kite into a fine mist, as the bloodied elderly man crashed heavily to the ground.

The flying sword elegantly returned to its master’s side, like a bird returning home, slowly swirling, extremely docile.

Chen Pingan glanced at the girl in the green dress, who grinned before shyly covering her mouth.

Chen Pingan also smiled, saying, “He Lu from Huangyue City, Yan Qing from Baodong Fairyland, and Lake Lord Yin Hou of Cangyun Lake, none of you told them that it’s best to bring the battlefield directly to Suijia City. Perhaps I would have been the most restrained, and you would have the best chance of retreating?”

Lake Lord Yin Hou released his grip, raising his head, “Sword immortal, I did mention this once, and He Lu also agreed. He even thought of numerous consecutive strategies, such as using various techniques to incite the populace to rush to the ghostly abode. However, in the end, both sides felt that being too close to Suijia City was risky, easily alerting you, a sword immortal who can take heads from a thousand steps away. No one wanted to be the first to die. The lives of the cultivators of Huangyue City and Baodong Fairyland are precious. They wouldn’t take the lead, and the other subordinate mountains weren’t full of fools. Who would want to engage in a venture where they could earn money but risk their lives? After much bickering, we ultimately had to abandon the idea. Sword immortal, I’ve said everything I needed to say, now feel free to kill. This Dragon Palace, built over a millennium, can be discarded. After today, as long as the sword immortal shows mercy, if I miraculously survive, Cangyun Lake will make sure to properly repair the mountain and water aura of Suijia City as a form of atonement.”

Upon hearing those first words, Yan Qing’s face turned pale, and her body began to tremble.

With her Dao heart unstable, the spiritual energy within her energy centers became erratic, causing her hand, which held the sword, to tremble uncontrollably.

Chen Pingan brought his fingers together and gently waved.

The city lord of Huangyue City deliberately remained motionless, allowing the long sword to pierce through his chest, pinning him against the wall.

And hovering just a foot away from Fan Weiran’s brow was a trembling tip of an emerald flying sword.

The old matriarch remained utterly still.

 ### Chapter 595: I'm Afraid of Myself

"You are undoubtedly the smartest among us, each one adept at assessing the situation. I truly admire you for this, without a hint of sarcasm," Chen Ping'an sighed, his hands clasped behind his back as he walked slowly forward. Suddenly, he noticed a wine flask, and with a casual flick of his wrist, he grasped it, poured a cup, took a sip, and with a rich smile said, "If a few more from the He family were here, or if the citizens of Suiji City saw this, they'd surely accuse me, the sword immortal, of being merciless, stirring up public resentment, and demanding justice. Why should I recklessly take lives, especially when I have barely met some of these people? No one has truly fought to the death; nobody's lost an arm or leg, or bled buckets. What right do I have to judge good and evil, to decree life and death? There’s no need to be so aggressive and bloodthirsty; it’s no different from the very people I’m meant to condemn..."

His words sent chills down the spines of all the Qi practitioners present.

What did this great sword immortal mean? Was it not over yet?

Chen Ping'an turned his gaze to the old woman seated at the head of the table. "You’re lucky; you don't have a son like He, so we can negotiate."

He then glanced at Ye Han. "But you, City Lord Ye, might find it more difficult."

The girl in the emerald dress fluttered her eyelashes.

She remained still like an old monk, relying on that strange, seemingly divine ability bestowed by the ancestors, stealing glances without moving an inch.

Suddenly, Chen Ping'an halted, as if the aura of the sword immortal had dissipated in an instant. His expression turned weary, his eyes dull, much like the sword that pierced through Ye Han's body hanging on the wall, the golden light dimmed. He looked around, poured another cup of wine, and casually spilled it at his feet, as if offering a memorial. He murmured to himself, "But those citizens of Suiji City, who after the heavenly tribulations prayed fervently at the City God Temple, bowing repeatedly, were merely seeking peace. They are the true weaklings. For many truths, most of them, especially those who chose silence, might never understand what truly happened. That’s why they pray to the City God and worship the Fire God; they’ve prayed in the wrong places. My feelings toward them are the same as some of your cultivators, who keep themselves pure and disdainful of the mundane world. It’s not about liking or disliking; there’s no right or wrong in this. There are countless paths beneath our feet; who is to say which is right? What do you think, City God of Suiji? In the end, it seems even atop the temple roof, you never cursed me? Instead, you rushed toward the heavenly tribulation in the cloud sea, your golden body shattered in two? At that moment, I truly couldn’t speak; otherwise, I would have scolded you a few times and sent you back to the temple. It was merely a small heavenly tribulation; would I die? I almost did, but I’m a cultivator, half-dead—what's there to fear? Before this, how many plans had I made? We met too late for me to tell you. Of course, if I had seen earlier, I wouldn’t have said anything; human hearts are like ghostly traps—who would dare to trust whom?"

As he spoke, a dull thud echoed in Fan Weiran’s mind.

His head reeled back as if struck hard.

Meanwhile, Ye Han remained unscathed, merely watching, pinned to the wall.

However, the old woman hadn’t truly perished, for her appearance withered instantly, yet unusual ripples of energy emerged within the Dragon Palace, fleeting and ephemeral.

The young sword immortal seemed somewhat helpless, crushing the wine cup in his hand. There was no other way; that jade talisman had been destroyed long ago. Otherwise, using such celestial methods capable of dissolving one's spirit like mist while hiding a life-giving golden pill, once he invoked that talisman from the Chongxuan Bureau's Cloud Palace, the old ancestor of the Baotong Immortal Realm wouldn’t have been able to escape.

After the battle, he could no longer draw talismans, let alone the few he was proficient in that couldn’t address this situation.

Thus, among the mountain cultivators, victory was easy, but killing was hard, especially for those who had entered the Golden Core stage; who didn’t have a few life-saving means?

In contrast, pure martial artists were much more straightforward; in a fight, losing often meant death.

But it was fine; the old woman still had that golden crown above her head.

Perhaps it couldn’t be taken away, or perhaps if she tried to escape with it, it would leave obvious traces. The old woman feared her own flying sword far too much.

Chen Ping'an took out a folding fan, gently fanning it with his fingers, and smiled, "What? You believe everything I say? If I claimed to be a sixth realm martial artist, not a sword cultivator, would you believe me?"

He turned to one of the Dream Liang Peak cultivators. "What do you say?"

That person immediately knelt down and shouted, "Whatever the sword immortal says, I believe!"

Chen Ping'an turned to the young couple burdened with their swords. "What a coincidence! We meet again. Did you two gain anything from your trip to Suiji City?"

The young man sat down abruptly.

The young woman softly replied, "Reporting to the sword immortal, we gained nothing."

Chen Ping'an laughed and asked, "What about that old man with the monkey on his shoulder? Didn’t you think of him during the melee?"

The young female cultivator grimaced, “Once we saw him, we ran away without a second thought.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, "That’s how it should be. In the future, let your junior brother be a little more amiable. When you descend the mountain for training, travel the world, watch more, and speak less."

Caught off guard by the young sword immortal’s unexpected politeness, the young female cultivator felt no joy but rather a sense of resignation, knowing that both she and her junior brother would probably face severe consequences. He Lu, a martial artist of the Golden Body realm from the Dream Liang Kingdom, Fan Weiran, the old offering of Huangyue City, and City Lord Ye Han—all who had spoken with this sword immortal were bound to meet unfortunate ends.

Chen Ping'an rubbed his temples, slightly frowning, then instantly relaxed, smiling at the two, "Fate brought us together; you may leave first."

The junior brother, who had collapsed to the ground, scrambled up and dashed for the palace door.

His senior sister couldn't stop him in time, fearing that a head would soon be severed by a flying sword. Unexpectedly, not only did her junior brother run far away, but he also urged, "Sister, hurry up!"

The young female cultivator looked at the sword immortal, whose smile was as warm as spring yet had the depth of an ancient well, hesitating before bowing, "Thank you, sword immortal, for your mercy!"

With trepidation, she circulated her spiritual energy and slowly exited the Dragon Palace, which lay in ruins.

Chen Ping'an strode forward, climbing the steps where the Lake Lord Yin Hou sat.

Meanwhile, the flying sword lingered around the white-robed sword immortal.

The sword immortal could do as he pleased; he wouldn’t lift a finger or entertain any ill thoughts today.

Yet Chen Ping'an did not sit upon the throne resembling the emperor's dragon seat. Instead, he extended a finger to tap it as if... inspecting goods?

Chen Ping'an turned around, resting his hand on the armrest of the throne, facing the crowd in the hall. "I’m not good at discerning good from bad people, so I’ll assume you all split evenly. At tonight’s banquet, half will die, and half will live. You either are close friends or enemies wishing to beat each other’s brains out, but you all know each other's backgrounds well. Why not speak up? Who among you has committed evil deeds? Try to pick the most shocking ones—nothing too outrageous is off-limits. If someone has something that others don't, then they become the good person, and they might just get a chance to live."

Silence hung heavily in the hall.

The white-robed sword immortal added with a smile, "Let me add that whatever conflict happened on the mountain doesn’t count. Tonight, we only discuss matters from below the mountain."

Suddenly, a youthful, clear voice piped up, "Sword immortal, it’s still daytime; you shouldn’t say 'tonight.'"

Chen Ping'an turned to see the speaker was the girl in the emerald dress, a relatively esteemed disciple of the Baotong Immortal Realm.

He smiled, "Thank you for the reminder. The Dragon Palace is so brightly lit that I mistakenly thought it was nighttime."

Ye Han suddenly spoke, "So your sword isn’t a magic treasure after all; it’s just as I thought."

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "I know the tricks of you Golden Core immortals are numerous; hurry up and leave."

Ye Han laughed heartily and stepped forward, allowing the long sword to pass completely through his body, embedding itself into the wall.

With a sigh, Ye Han said, "I didn’t expect Huangyue City to fall to such depths. The most promising heir is dead, the chief offering has died; I, Ye Han, have also suffered a fundamental injury to my Dao. There’s no hope for me to take that step upward in this life. Sword immortal, what must I do to avoid you hunting down Huangyue City and eradicate us completely?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "It's simple; don’t try to confuse me here. Since I can’t shatter your Golden Core, hurry and find your backer. After the heavenly tribulation, he did show up over Suiji City. If I’m not wrong, you must have some connection with him. That person is of a high realm and previously harmed me greatly. The moment he arrives, we’ll settle both old and new scores. But if he can summon the one who successfully seized the treasure to deal with me, then even if you have some influence, I’ll have to flee. Our Lake Lord has a channel master; her temple has a very good plaque, 'Green Waters Flow Forever.'"

Ye Han replied helplessly, "Since the sword immortal has revealed the secrets, does that mean it's no longer a matter of life and death? Will you not allow me to take He Lu’s soul away?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Actually, I wanted to say that you could take He Lu’s three souls and seven spirits so that your escape plan would leave traces. Even if I said this earlier, would you dare to do it? I don’t think you would."

Ye Han nodded, "Indeed, I wouldn’t. Then as the sword immortal said, 'Green Waters Flow Forever!'"

The city lord of Huangyue City crushed the jade token at his waist.

His figure vanished into thin air.

Chen Ping'an turned his gaze towards the ceiling, as if his sight had traveled far across the surface of Cangjun Lake.

That jade token had a more exaggerated effect than a golden material square inch talisman.

Chen Ping'an rubbed his temples.

His head throbbed.

The long sword on the wall flashed with golden light, stabbing into the crucial acupoint of He Lu's headless body.

Then a burst of black smoke surged from He Lu’s body, instantly splitting into ten wisps, attempting to flee in different directions, but all were sent crashing against the wall with a flick of the white-robed sword immortal's sleeve, turning to ashes that fell like dust.

When he lifted his head, his expression had softened, "You can now start laying out the facts and reasons; cherish this chance. I believe that in your previous cultivation careers, there haven’t been many times talking sense has helped you survive."

The white-robed sword immortal made a swift motion, drawing the sword back to himself, sheathing it in midair.

He sat on the dragon throne, the sword resting across his knees.

Yan Qing faced the white-robed sword immortal seated above, speaking solemnly, "This version of you is truly terrifying!"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Don’t mention it; I’m afraid of myself too."

The girl in the emerald dress quickly grabbed Yan Qing's wrist, her face frantic. Tears glistened in her eyes as she spoke with her heart, "Aunt Yan, please stop talking! He has already tried to kill you twice; this is real! Adding this time, it’s just as he said—things come in threes! The sword immortal’s words are shrouded in mist and confusion, no one can comprehend his intentions, but I can sense his general meaning. Aunt Yan, I’m begging you! In our sect, only you and our second ancestor have truly cared for me. I don’t want to see you dead too."

Chen Ping'an rested his elbow on the armrest of the dragon throne, leaning back lazily, "If you don’t stop talking, I’ll randomly start slaughtering."

So, someone began to expose the secrets of another Qi practitioner.

It was a cultivator from a rival sect, at the Cave Dwelling level.

The sect’s foundation was shallow, the practitioner’s realm was low, but the misdeeds committed were numerous.

The person who spoke had carefully chosen their target.

On the line between life and death, if they didn’t start using their brains, would they go to the legendary Underworld to plead their case?

The Dragon Palace of Cangjun Lake remained brightly lit, indistinguishable from day.

Yet the scene on the lake was tranquil and serene, with the crescent moon hanging low among the willow branches.

Suiji City had already extinguished their lamps, taken down their lanterns, and every household shut their doors, not daring to increase the light at night to avoid attracting trouble.

From the green waves emerged a young sword immortal in white, with the Lake Lord Yin Hou beside him, who had regained his composure.

As for those in the Dragon Palace, after all the commotion, half were dead, not the prearranged half.

Those who survived felt no grievance against this sword immortal’s temper; they had survived, and what more could they ask for? 

Chen Ping'an held a crystal-clear porcelain vial, inside which green water rippled gently. This vial contained the essence of water—rare and precious, and for him, it was like a timely rain.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Lake Lord, would you say your luck is good or bad?"

The Lake Lord, now without the vivid purple robe, smiled, "I’m not thinking about such things at all. In the future, as the Lake Lord of Cangjun, I will protect this land diligently. I won’t make any grand claims, just honestly follow the sword immortal’s orders—ensuring this Cangjun Lake has a hundred years of favorable weather without any natural disasters. As for man-made calamities, I will still heed the sword immortal’s advice and let them be."

"Making grand claims? That’s a good saying among your water gods."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, adding, "And don’t forget that matter."

The Lake Lord Yin Hou bowed his head, clasping his fists, "I shall remember, sword immortal. Rest assured, if it doesn’t work out, when you return from your travels, just come back and kill me with a sword."

The white-robed sword immortal then soared away on his sword.

The Lake Lord of Cangjun Lake, stripped of his dragon robe and the dragon throne, remained seated for a long time before finally exhaling deeply.

He hadn’t expected that merely surviving would bring such immense happiness.

The ways of the Dao are ever-changing, nothing more so than this.

Earlier, it felt like this sword immortal had taken on the role of a fair and just City God in his Dragon Palace hall.

How strange.

Perhaps this was what a true sword immortal was like.

The two female cultivators avoided the water and came to the lake's surface. At this moment, the Lake Lord Yin Hou saw that stunningly beautiful face and felt that even a glance was blinding, all the trouble brought upon by these cultivators of the Baotong Immortal Realm!

With a cold snort, the Lake Lord Yin Hou vanished into the water.

The girl in the emerald dress complained, "That sword immortal is so greedy! After getting the old ancestor Fan’s golden crown, he didn’t even spare Aunt Yan’s! Not only that, he even had the audacity to ask if there was any summer or rain money. I was right not to admire sword immortals; this kind of featherweight sword immortal doesn’t have an ounce of sword immortal demeanor!"

It turned out Yan Qing no longer wore the golden crown atop her head.

She held the girl’s hand, gazing into the distance, lost in thought, then smiled, "You’re right, why would you admire such a person?"

The girl hugged Yan Qing's arm and gently shook it, asking sweetly, "Aunt Yan, why don’t we return to the Baotong Immortal Realm with the sect? The outside world is so dangerous."

Yan Qing suddenly laughed, "Cui girl, let’s not return to the sect just yet; let’s roam the world instead?"

The girl thought for a moment, her smile blossoming radiantly, "Alright! I’ve been wanting to sneak a drink!"

As the cultivators from the Dragon Palace of Cangjun Lake scattered like birds and beasts, the white-robed immortal rode his sword into the city, but not directly toward the haunted house.

Instead, he sheathed his sword behind him and landed in a dark alley, bending to pick up a summer coin. Holding the coin in one hand, he patted his forehead with the folding fan in the other, his face twisted in mock despair, murmuring, "Picking up such dirty money? After making such a fortune in the Dragon Palace, it shouldn’t come to this. Well, well, it’s true; if you don’t pick it up, you miss out. For so many years, I haven’t been a true cultivator. I earn money, I cultivate, I practice martial arts—whoever does poorly is my child or grandchild. Killing Yuan Ying and ascending to the heavens is difficult, but I’ve lost to myself—okay, I admit I have, and it was quite miserable. Ultimately, isn’t it still about how strong I am?"

These words would only be understood by Jiang Shangzhen or Yang Ningsheng from the Chongxuan Bureau.

With a graceful flick of his sleeve, the white-robed sword immortal strolled leisurely back to the haunted house.

Spiritual guardians along the way felt a flicker of awareness, instantly retreating to hide.

With a light leap, he vaulted over the courtyard wall and landed in the yard.

Chen Ping'an squinted as soon as he landed.

Du Yu was startled like seeing a ghost in broad daylight, quickly spreading out his hand to reveal a talisman that could buy numerous divine armors. Though his teeth rattled, he still managed to complain, "Senior, there’s a guy who first called himself Zhou Fei and then claimed to be Jiang Shangzhen, saying he’s your good brother. He took that child away. I used the immobilization technique on him, and he couldn’t move at all, not even to destroy everything with him. He said that the little orphan has the potential for cultivation and that he took him back to Treasure Bottle Continent. He told you not to worry and just to travel to the north with peace of mind."

Chen Ping'an nodded, casually tossing the sword he’d summoned into a corridor pillar, then sat on a bamboo chair. He secured his sword hilt, and the flying sword joyfully darted into it. Chen Ping'an reclined back, slowly saying, "Got it. You keep this Golden Crow talisman; it’s yours. No need to be polite with that guy; he has money, and you know what they say—money burns your hands."

Du Yu was overjoyed. After holding back for so long, he couldn’t help but smile broadly as he sat on the little stool, keenly examining that invaluable talisman.

Chen Ping'an glanced at him and chuckled, "You’ve grown bold after meeting Jiang Shangzhen."

Du Yu grinned, "I wouldn’t dare to boast; Jiang senior is a peer of your esteemed self, and I’m just a junior among juniors—hardly worth comparing."

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes, smiling, "Here you go again, making me feel sick."

Du Yu scratched his head.

At dawn, the senior instructed him to do something odd—go to Suiji City’s shop and buy couplets, painted door gods, and spring and fortune characters.

Du Yu was anxious; it wasn’t because he feared being splattered with filth the moment he stepped outside, but because he was afraid of being seen by the likes of Old Ancestor Fan and City Lord Ye, who might take advantage of him to slap him dead and run away.

He didn’t dare to ask about the outcome of the sword immortal's trip to Cangjun Lake last night, knowing better than to pry.

With trepidation, Du Yu bought items he had never touched in his life; not only did he pay the price, but he also generously tipped with some loose change.

He had to be warm and friendly every day now!

If he scared a child on the street, Du Yu was ready to apologize voluntarily.

Having returned safely to the haunted house, Du Yu stood outside, carrying his bundle, wiping the sweat from his brow. The world of the Jianghu was treacherous, with danger lurking everywhere. It was indeed safer to stay closer to the senior.

At this moment, Du Yu saw someone who appeared to be a deeply concealed master in everyone he met on the road.

Then the senior took the bundle, not needing Du Yu’s help. He started pasting the door gods and couplets, along with the spring and fortune characters.

When the senior affixed the last spring character, he paused and looked up, lost in thought.

Du Yu inexplicably recalled the senior saying, "The spring breeze passes once," and that it was the best saying in the world and shouldn’t be tarnished.

The two left the haunted house.

The senior visited the ruins of the Fire God Temple. Wherever he went, the common folk scattered in fear, as if encountering wolves or leopards.

At the main hall’s ruins, he knelt down, lit three sticks of incense, and after placing them, smiled, "I can’t just fulfill your wishes; if I close my eyes, it’s over. I still want you to come back and share the misery with me. Next time we meet, after scolding me, don’t forget to buy me a drink."

Du Yu didn’t understand why the senior said this. Could this spirit of the Fire God Temple, who couldn’t possibly return, truly come back? Even if the temple were rebuilt and the local authorities made clay statues, it wouldn’t erase the historical records of the Silver Screen Kingdom. How much incense and sincere wishes from the citizens of Suiji City would be needed to reconstruct a golden body?

After leaving Suiji City together, they traveled some distance through the mountains and rivers. Then one day, the senior, who had long since discarded his bamboo hat and green robe, took out the hat and walking stick again, carrying a heavy bamboo box, yet still wore a snow-white robe.

Chen Ping'an handed Du Yu two pieces of paper, one named the Sunlight Lantern Talisman and the other the Obstruction Breaking Talisman. "In the future, as you travel the Jianghu, doing good or evil will be your own business. But if you encounter unnecessary matters, like being a warm-hearted Jianghu hero or exterminating demons and helping the people as a Qi practitioner, you can use these two talismans. Otherwise, don’t be greedy; if you learn the arts of talisman drawing, treat them as two pieces of waste paper. Can you do that? Think carefully before deciding if you’ll accept them. If you do, remember to destroy them after reading. If not, just leave; it’s no trouble."

Du Yu took the two pieces of paper without hesitation. "Senior, don’t worry; as you said, life and death are of one’s own making. Today, having taken these two pieces of paper, once I learn the talismans you teach me, unless it’s a situation where I’m bound to die, if I have the heart, I, Du Yu, will do my best!"

The senior smiled and patted Du Yu’s shoulder, "That’s good."

Du Yu found himself with tears in his eyes, watching the senior's distant figure.

Du Yu suddenly asked, "Senior, since you’re a sword immortal, why don’t you fly around on your sword?"

The man merely adjusted his hat, waved his hand, and continued on his way.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 596: The Goodhearted Young Girl (Part One)

The Huaihuang Kingdom was a small, barren country in the northern territories, where both the court and the common folk struggled with poverty. So dire was the situation that the king could not even send officials to pay their respects to the gods of the Five Mountains in due time, leading to the belief that the officials from the Ministry of Rites and the Ministry of Revenue never ascended the mountains.

Perhaps it was due to the court's lack of reverence for the masters of the Five Mountains, combined with the scarcity of local temples and shrines, that the streets and fields of Huaihuang Kingdom were frequently plagued by demons and monsters. As a result, many cultivators and eminent monks from other countries traveled through the mountains and rivers, rescuing the common people from calamity. However, these revered figures, who were quite popular in the local rural areas, never crossed paths with the genuine nobles of Huaihuang Kingdom. Eventually, they simply bypassed the capital altogether to avoid unnecessary frustrations.

On this day, at the border checkpoint between Huaihuang Kingdom and the southern Silver Screen Kingdom, a young scholar clad in white and wearing a bamboo hat presented his travel documents and entered the border city. After strolling around, he found a spot on a bamboo crate at a market bridge, where he munched on a freshly bought scallion pancake. He listened to a storyteller regaling the local folk and a few small-time merchants with bizarre tales. The storyteller, an elderly man in his seventies, surprisingly had a strong voice that could shake the heavens as he passionately recounted stories of a terrifying monster that had recently appeared in Buyao County. This monster, which had taken residence on a mountain, transformed into black smoke at night and sneaked into the county town to abduct young maidens. The local government was powerless to stop it, prompting an old immortal invited by the county magistrate to set up an altar and perform rituals, which summoned thunder.

In the dead of night, when the moon was obscured by clouds, a sudden torrential downpour erupted with thunder that reverberated through the skies. A bolt of lightning struck the mountain where the monster hid amidst the miasma. Later, a brave woodcutter, following the noise, ventured into the mountains only to discover the enormous snake, as thick as a well, had been struck dead by the lightning. Unfortunately, the young maidens were not so lucky; the valley was littered with skeletons, their remains stark against the earth—likely belonging to those unfortunate girls.

The listeners gasped in horror, their hair standing on end, and chills ran down their spines. The young scholar in the snow-white robe was equally shocked, reacting in kind.

As coins jingled, some audience members stepped forward to throw money into the storyteller's large white bowl, which prompted others to follow suit. The storyteller glanced at the bowl, stroked his beard with a smile, and thought it was enough to buy two jugs of wine.

He then continued with tales of other counties plagued by demons and monsters, lamenting that the local magistrate of Yuhu County was a miser, lacking connections and unwilling to pay a hefty sum to invite cultivators or immortal teachers to subdue the demons. The people of Yuhu County were truly pitiful, tormented by chaos, fortunate that the demons, while rampant, were far weaker than the serpent demon of Buyao County. Otherwise, it would have been a disastrous affair.

The common folk loved a good spectacle, and one man asked what kind of monster was causing trouble in Yuhu County. The storyteller began to elaborate, describing a white-robed ghost that enjoyed scaring the night watchmen by knocking on doors late at night, causing the townsfolk to refrain from venturing out after dark. There were also wild foxes and rabbits emerging from abandoned graves, with alluring women enticing men to absorb their life essence. Furthermore, a group of malicious spirits had driven away the temple monks, taking over their territory, and a girl in green at the ferry would stir up trouble by summoning storms with the river’s water.

Some scoffed, claiming that the Silver Screen Kingdom and Huaihuang Kingdom had been peaceful for hundreds of years, with no sightings of strange creatures. They wondered how such phenomena could suddenly appear, suspecting it might be a ploy by someone trying to swindle money. The storyteller, with a frown, declared that he had seen the corpse of the serpent demon in Buyao County and the ghastly visage of the green-clad water ghost.

The audience erupted in laughter, disbelieving him.

The elderly storyteller scanned the crowd before settling his gaze on the white-robed scholar who had just finished his scallion pancake. He pointed, saying, "This gentleman from afar must be well-read and knowledgeable. Let’s ask him if spirits and monsters truly exist in this world. Scholar, even if you haven't seen them, surely you've heard of them?"

The crowd turned in unison to look at the young man in the bamboo hat. He shook his head and replied, "I have neither seen nor heard of them."

A collective gasp arose. 

The storyteller realized the situation was going south and hurriedly gathered his large white bowl, announcing the end of the performance. Damn it, not a single scholar was worth a dime; they wouldn’t even support him with a little coin, let alone lend a hand in boosting morale! It was clear he was someone who would never achieve academic success.

As the stall was packed up, the crowd dispersed.

The storyteller glared fiercely at the scholarly traveler. 

Chen Ping’an smiled and stood up, securing his bamboo crate. The sword immortal, sword nurturing gourd, and jade bamboo fan had already been placed inside the crate, leaving only a verdant mountain staff in his hand. Throughout his journey, he had refined the staff, and he had also concealed several ordinary yellow paper talismans in his sleeve, including common entry-level talismans like the Yang Qi Lantern Talisman, Dust Purging Talisman, and Obstruction Breaking Talisman from the "True Record of Alchemical Scripts."

Approaching the old man, Chen Ping’an said, "Old sir, let me treat you to a drink. Would you like some?"

The storyteller glanced sideways at him, observing the young man who seemed harmless and lacked the strength to harm a fly. It was a treacherous world out there; who could know which seemingly shallow puddle might cause someone to trip? Though his mouth watered at the thought of a drink, the old man forced down his saliva and smiled, "No need, no need. I appreciate your kind offer, young sir, but I must hurry along to Silver Screen Kingdom to make a living. The inns around here charge exorbitantly, and staying on the streets would invite trouble. It’s better to cross the border and sleep in the wilds, where the heavens and earth care not."

Chen Ping’an sighed, "Alright then, I won’t insist. I’ll just consider it as saving a jug of Flying Dust Wine from Bixian Tower."

The old man’s eyes lit up, and the thirst for wine stirred within him. He glanced at the sky and laughed heartily, "Looking at the time, it’s still early. No need to rush! Let those brothers from Silver Screen Kingdom wait a little longer. Since the young sir is so gracious, I won’t refuse. Let’s go to Bixian Tower; I haven’t tried that Flying Dust Wine yet. Thanks to you, I’ll enjoy a good drink!"

Chen Ping’an nodded with a smile, "Won’t you call your disciple along as well?"

The old man turned slightly, beckoning the first person who had tossed money into the bowl to come closer. In a low voice, he said, "Young sir, you have a good eye."

Upon arriving at the largest tavern in the city, the three of them were guided by the attentive staff to a table on the second floor. Chen Ping’an ordered a table full of dishes and three jugs of Flying Dust Wine. The old man waited until the wine was served before quietly placing the jug that had been set beside his disciple in front of himself, smiling, "I forgot to mention, this disciple of mine doesn’t drink. You’ve been too generous, too generous."

Chen Ping’an looked surprised, "Shall I ask the waiter to take back that extra jug of Flying Dust Wine? That’s two taels of silver."

The old man quickly wrapped his arms around the two jugs of wine, saying, "Don’t be so hasty, young sir. How can a good wine be taken back once it’s on the table? That would be like a beauty undressing and then asking her to leave! What a terrible sight that would be!"

Chen Ping’an removed the mud seal and poured himself a bowl of wine, grinning as he asked, "You wouldn’t happen to be from Dream Grain Kingdom, would you?"

The old man shook his head, "I hail from the far western Qingjing Kingdom. I’ve been a storyteller since I was twenty-six, wandering through many countries. I’ve only visited Dream Grain Kingdom once, which is a rare paradise on earth. I’ve thought about it as a place to retire, since I have no family ties left at home. If my disciple does well and earns some real money, I could be buried back in my homeland when I close my eyes."

Chen Ping’an smiled, "Then just drink your fill."

At that moment, Chen Ping’an could see that this storyteller was a third-tier Qi practitioner, which meant that the old man was either a wandering cultivator of the lower fifth tier or held a cultivation level significantly higher than Ye Han and Fan Weiran, two notorious Golden Core practitioners. In this realm of numerous countries, aside from the two hidden masterminds, Ye Han and Fan Weiran had rightfully earned their titles as "mountain peak" practitioners.

One day prior, the borders of the numerous countries had experienced a ripple of spiritual energy, akin to the awakening of spring thunder. Chen Ping’an had immediately sensed a call and soared into the sky on his sword. He saw a long golden line suddenly appear on the ground, only to be consumed in flames, indicating that one of the great practitioners had dismantled their boundary and restrictions. Most likely, it was the hidden mastermind from Dream Grain Kingdom who had acquired a treasured artifact from the City of the Holy Guard. Meanwhile, the other great practitioner, known only as Xia Zhen, had yet to reveal himself, leaving Chen Ping’an feeling uneasy. Logically, this was quite troubling. The treasures of the Holy Cave and the Yellow Axe City, both led by the two opposing forces, were likely the birds and fish raised in the cage by the latter. Such a significant loss without any movement indicated two possibilities: either a lion would use all its strength to hunt a rabbit, or Xia Zhen was waiting for him somewhere, or perhaps Jiang Shangzhen had already quietly cleaned up the mess before revealing himself in the City of the Holy Guard. Xia Zhen could be dead or narrowly escaped, yet severely weakened and unable to deliver a deadly blow against him.

If this storyteller was indeed the senior from Dream Grain Kingdom who had come specifically to meet him, Chen Ping’an was not interested in exchanging words or engaging in a battle of wits; he would rather roll up his sleeves and fight it out right then and there.

The old man smiled, "What’s this? Do you have acquaintances in Dream Grain Kingdom? Are they enemies you can’t share the same sky with, or are they dear friends you long for? If it’s the latter, once I finish my journey through Silver Screen Kingdom, I’ll gladly travel to Dream Grain Kingdom with my silly disciple and help you relay a message or two—though..."

The old man extended two fingers, lightly pinching them. 

Chen Ping’an shook his head, "There are no deep grudges or great enmities; we merely coexist without interfering with each other. I admire a certain master from Dream Grain Kingdom for his exceptional skills and meticulous methods. I truly want to sincerely invite him for a drink. Since the situation is now settled, it’s just like reviewing a chess game. That master made the first move years ago, exerted great strength, remained steady in the mid-game, and made several brilliant moves during the endgame. How could no one appreciate that? Even if you received a large bowl of copper coins in the end, wouldn’t it still be a regret if no one cheered for you?"

The old man took a sip of wine, "Although I don’t know what you’re talking about, it sounds reasonable enough. Then shall we toast?"

Chen Ping’an raised his wine bowl and clinked it with the old man’s, both drinking deeply.

Not only was drinking with like-minded individuals enjoyable, but amidst the clashing of swords and blades, even drinking with rivals filled with malice could serve as training.

As for the recent peculiar occurrences in the small northern kingdom of Huaihuang, with the sudden increase of demons and monsters, it was related to the influx of spiritual energy from the outside, flooding into the territories of the numerous countries. Without the imposing presence of the Thunder Pool, the spirits, like snakes and insects after the awakening of spring, were stirring and breaking through the earth.

However, Chen Ping’an had no intention of confronting the powerful figures from Dream Grain Kingdom or the mysterious cultivator named Xia Zhen just yet. Above the Golden Core, the Nascent Soul was manageable; if he couldn’t win, he could still run. But as long as one of them reached the Jade Pure realm, even if they both did not, it would still pose a tremendous threat to him. Chen Ping’an had no favorable time, place, or people to rely on. If the other party was truly determined to kill him without considering the cost, the temper of the northern Julu Island cultivators would leave no room for hesitation. In this exclusionary land of sword immortals, outsiders with backing and connections had met their end more than once.

Otherwise, given the influx of spiritual energy like a tidal wave, Chen Ping’an could boldly use the Saint’s jade token to collect it all. However, using this token, which could invoke fear in Liu Lao in Shujian Lake, across the continent would be a different story altogether. It would attract resentment and accountability from the entire academy of the continent.

Comparing the two hidden masterminds, Chen Ping’an was more wary of the great practitioner related to Dream Grain Kingdom, who was plotting relentlessly and carefully. There was no need for that individual to act personally; just sending two subordinates was enough to acquire the valuable treasures from the City of the Holy Guard. In the end, if it weren’t for his entrance into the Dragon Palace in Cangyun Lake, that martial artist posing as a disciple among the Qi practitioners would have continued to conceal himself.

Upon encountering Du Yu, one could generally gauge the situation of the Ghostly Axe Palace. Meeting Zhu Xiqi and Lady Zaoqu would reveal the customs of Cangyun Lake. Seeing Yan Qing would give insight into the treasures of the Holy Cave, while observing He Lu would indicate the style of Huang Axe City. The same principle applied; of course, there would be errors, but the more one interacted, the closer they would draw to the truth. In that case, the risks would decrease. Sometimes, one could even see a glimpse of the whole picture, as was the case with the City God of the Holy Guard and the masterminds Ye Han and Fan Weiran, who determined how their family’s values influenced their decisions.

One looking upward and the other downward, when combined, formed the two ends of a vein. Once someone grasped both ends, no matter how far the hidden lines extended, it would be hard to escape scrutiny.

The world was complex. To live more easily, one could either bury their head under the covers, accepting their fate in hardships and fortunes, or they could observe and ponder more. The latter required effort and was labor-intensive; one mountain is always higher than another. Even the various saints stationed in small realms, like gods, would still be bound when they stepped outside their territories, needing to pay attention to the numerous connections and complex rules of the world.

Rationality might not always be of use.

Understanding the rules was not a bad thing.

Did the Lord of Lake Jun speak reason? Yet he understood how to discern the rules of others, grasping Chen Ping’an’s actions. Therefore, the skies above Cangyun Lake were shrouded in dark clouds, and Chen Ping’an dared not kill him out of fear that the lakes and rivers would flood, causing untold suffering to innocents.

Within the Dragon Palace, he was no less deserving of death than Ye Han or Fan Weiran, but he had proactively promised to protect the living of Cangyun Lake in the future, mending the fortune of the land, thus avoiding the repercussions of his fists and swords.

Meanwhile, the storyteller and his disciple gorged themselves, enjoying their meal.

Chen Ping’an merely sipped from his bowl of wine, never once reaching for the chopsticks.

The storyteller burped with satisfaction and laughed, "Young sir, not a single bite taken, just drinking. Are you not hungry at all?"

Chen Ping’an smiled, "I’m truly not hungry. Besides, I believe this meal should be for the old sir."

The old man sighed, "Your words are as baffling as a bald donkey preaching Zen; they leave one scratching their head."

Chen Ping’an asked, "When do you plan to cross over to Silver Screen Kingdom?"

The old man chuckled, "I’m just about to leave, once I’ve eaten my fill. By the way, I’ve learned a bit of fortune-telling. Since the young sir has treated me to such a meal, how about I read your fortune for you? Don’t worry, no charge."

Chen Ping’an nodded, "Then I’ll trouble you, old sir."

The old man pulled a few copper coins he had obtained earlier from his sleeve and casually tossed them onto the table, stroking his beard in thought, falling silent.

Chen Ping’an merely smiled and remained silent.

The old man gently shifted the coins on the table, frowning as he said, "Young sir, you have a kind heart, which is a great blessing. However, you must also be cautious. Blessed people must not fall into misfortunes. Old sayings are never baseless; listeners should not take them lightly. I see that your journey to Huaihuang Kingdom has many paths to take, but you absolutely must avoid the Jihuan Mountain a hundred miles ahead. That place is a land of misfortune for you. You may not encounter great dangers, but if you run into obstructive evils, it will surely be an unpleasant experience."

Chen Ping’an smiled, "Alright, I’ll heed the old sir’s advice and detour around Jihuan Mountain."

The old man looked up, smiling, "You truly believe me?"

Chen Ping’an replied, "When an elder shares wisdom, how can I not trust them? Anyway, detouring a bit while traveling through Huaihuang Kingdom is no great matter."

The old man rose and praised, "Then I won’t trouble you any longer. I’ll take my leave and hurry through the border. Reading fortunes can be unsettling, so it’s better not to linger."

Chen Ping’an nodded, "I’ll finish this jug of wine and also detour northward. I won’t be looking for trouble at Jihuan Mountain."

The old man left Bixian Tower alongside his slow-witted disciple.

Once Chen Ping’an finished the local specialty of Flying Dust Wine, he went downstairs to settle the bill, only to pause in surprise before shaking his head and smiling. He ended up paying a full twenty taels of silver for the wine and dishes. It turned out that the storyteller had secretly taken two jugs of the tavern’s twenty-year-old treasured wine when he left, claiming it was paid for by a friend upstairs. Chen Ping’an didn’t mind too much; after all, the storyteller’s identity was no longer a mystery, alleviating a burden and allowing him to focus on his cultivation without distraction. Paying a few extra taels was still a worthwhile exchange.

In the end, Chen Ping’an indeed took a detour around Jihuan Mountain, which was a scenic area with multiple waterfalls he had originally intended to visit.

**Within Jihuan Mountain.**

In a halfway resting pavilion, a young man with a jade belt around his waist had a sullen expression. Beside him stood Ye Han, Fan Weiran, and a second ancestor of the Baotong Wonderland, a woman. 

This was none other than Xia Zhen, who had narrowly escaped death.

Xia Zhen roared, "You old fool, why are you ruining my grand plan?! I’ve already made it clear that I’ve sent a letter to that great sword immortal in the central region. This person is Jiang Shangzhen’s accomplice. Even if Jiang Shangzhen is hiding in the shadows, he’ll still be terrified and cautious! You’ve scared away the bait this time, and if the great sword immortal gets angry, do you really think you’ve refined the innate sword pellet and stepped into the upper fifth tier?! Are you stupid? I’ve already vowed that half of the semi-immortal weapon belongs to you, and I only seek the other items on him. Isn’t that enough for you?! Must we both end up with nothing for you to be happy?"

From a distance, atop a mountain, a scholarly elder smiled faintly. A storyteller and a wooden-faced young man appeared beside him, merging into one figure.

This was likely the celestial method of the sun god’s true body and the yin god's astral projection traveling together. 

The elder smiled, "Don’t try to frighten me with your empty words. Just based on the temperament of that great sword immortal, even if he received your secret letter, he wouldn’t care to act against us. Do you think we’re simply playing around in these numerous countries? It doesn’t take such efforts."

The elder was the national teacher of Dream Grain Kingdom. He pinched a messaging flying sword between his fingers and lightly shattered it. "Moreover, that great sword immortal has yet to receive your secret letter."

Xia Zhen’s face darkened, and he suddenly smiled in rage, "Are you planning to make a lifelong enemy of me, Xia Zhen?!"

The old national teacher smiled, "The borders of these numerous countries have seen a significant increase in spiritual energy lately, making it neither a good nor a bad place. We’ve been neighbors for years. You, Xia Zhen, are notoriously difficult to deal with. Although I’ve been affected at the essence of the Dao, I cannot kill you, and you would find it equally difficult to kill me. What we’re competing in is who can reach the upper fifth tier first. So why would I allow you to send a letter to the great sword immortal in the central region? What if the great sword immortal truly hates Jiang Shangzhen and is willing to lower himself to act against a minor sword cultivator? In that case, if you managed to curry favor with such a powerful figure, how could I possibly compete with you for the territory of these numerous countries once I reach the Jade Pure realm? Xia Zhen, what a pity! You’ve grown anxious and slowed down the rate at which you’re absorbing spiritual energy from the borders, and now you have to waste two weeks setting up a mountain-moving formation at Jihuan Mountain, only to find there’s no chance to use it?"

Xia Zhen sneered, "But aren’t you here?"

The old man feigned surprise, "That’s true. However, I’m not sure whether my little refined sword pellet will be stronger than your mountain-moving formation. Sooner or later, we will have to face each other. If it happens earlier, it will save us some trouble. The times have changed; you should know that you are no longer in a favorable position."

The Dream Grain Kingdom national teacher shook his head with a smile, "It’s not that I look down on you, Xia Zhen. This formation can indeed injure him, but it may not be able to trap him. I’m doing you a favor by pulling you back from the cliff. You should not be so foolish to rely on a secret letter that may very well disappear without a trace, thinking you can play a game of mutual destruction with Jiang Shangzhen. I may not have your connections, but I know more about certain old matters than you do. If you send a secret letter to that great sword immortal in the north, I won’t stop that flying sword."

Suppressing a chuckle, the old man gazed at Xia Zhen, his eyes filled with mockery and pity. "Because that’s a male sword immortal whose beloved daughter was harmed by Jiang Shangzhen. Should he fail to achieve the Dao, he will not spare any effort to kill Jiang Shangzhen. But the person you are trying to contact is a woman. It seems you are not quite aware of her enmity with Jiang Shangzhen. It’s not as the rumors say; she doesn’t regret her infatuation with Jiang Shangzhen. She hates him for his love affairs with others. If she were to meet him, she might very well end up charming him into revealing his secrets, and then you wouldn’t be surprised if that female sword immortal returned the favor by giving both you and me a sword each! So you see, Xia Zhen, you are hardly a good ally. If that young man had a bit more cultivation, and shared the same Nascent Soul stage as us, I might have to join forces with him to take you down. As it stands, it’s too late for me to engage in a battle of attrition, so you can take your time recovering your spiritual energy. The more slowly you absorb it, the longer you’ll be delayed. According to my calculations from back then, your bottleneck to the Nascent Soul stage will arrive a full sixty years later than mine. It seems you’re still unstable in your Dao heart. At our level, if you continue to act like a wild cultivator who once had the upper hand, you will suffer greatly."

The pavilion where Xia Zhen stood suddenly crumbled to dust. Ye Han, Fan Weiran, and the second ancestor of Baotong Wonderland were all forced to retreat, suspended in the air, their faces filled with alarm.

The old man ignored them and continued, "We’ve at least formed an alliance and cooperated. I’ve been hiding my identity in Dream Grain Kingdom, and although I had intentions at the start, my experiences in the mundane world have undoubtedly benefited my Dao heart. Therefore, I can always suppress you. You really think it’s merely calculations? No, I’ve seized the opportunity to merge with the Nascent Soul before you, Xia Zhen. If Jiang Shangzhen were truly your friend, he wouldn’t leave any loose ends. He only looks further than we do, and he’s planned for today’s events."

Xia Zhen’s imposing aura receded, and he smiled, "You’re trying to ruin my grand plans while throwing me into disarray. You old thief have good schemes!"

The old man sighed, "Xia Zhen, truth and falsehood, good and bad—whatever my original intention, whether sincere or deceitful, according to our previous agreement, I won’t deliberately obstruct your absorption of spiritual energy. However, I’ve already taken the lead—no, I should say two steps ahead of you. So when I break through to the upper fifth tier in the future, I’ll give you a choice: to escape from this place and continue living as a wandering wild cultivator, or to become the chief devotee of my sect. We won’t need to squabble over this little territory anymore. If we could have two Jade Pures together, sharing honor and disgrace, it would be a legendary tale of wild cultivators in the northern Julu Island."

Xia Zhen remained silent, gazing up at the scholarly elder atop the mountain. 

Finally, he asked with a smile, "Did you always have such grand ambitions to pull me into your sect as a devotee?"

The elder shook his head, "Below the upper fifth tier, regardless of whether you are what the world calls an earthly celestial, people still drift with the tide. It’s only after I obtained the treasure of merit that my heart has become more complete, allowing me to hold such aspirations. Thus, when Jiang Shangzhen injured you, I had no intention of taking advantage of that situation. Otherwise, having intercepted the flying sword, would I just sit idly by while you lingered at Jihuan Mountain? An eye for an eye; I would have wiped you out. What wild cultivator wouldn’t?"

Xia Zhen pressed down on the lethargic horned blue serpent, quirking a smile, "Did you ever consider that I might have more than one flying sword for messaging? You captured only the one I allowed you to find. Why don’t you calculate the timing from when Jiang Shangzhen left the City of the Holy Guard to return and when I showed up at Jihuan Mountain? Isn’t it possible that I planned for him to appear alongside the northern sword immortal?"

The old man sighed, "Words can only go so far. If you wish to gamble, go ahead. You, Xia Zhen, have clearly lost your mind to betting; there’s no need for more talk."

Xia Zhen grinned, "Yes, I am indeed red-eyed from gambling right now. You can stand there speaking without concern, but don’t blame me if I injure myself again just to slow your sword pellet’s refinement!"

The old man waved his hand, "Forget it; let’s say my sect will just lose a Jade Pure devotee."

Xia Zhen waved his sleeve, his expression darkening, "Get lost, you old dog! I can’t stand the sight of you!"

The old man laughed it off, his figure disappearing.

Xia Zhen stood amidst the ruins of the pavilion, like a trapped beast circling in a cage. He then raised his hands, manipulating the mountain-moving formation to lift several peaks, including Jihuan Mountain, as if they were cut from the roots. The mountain tops pointed downward, suspended in mid-air, then one by one, they crashed down. Each time they struck the ground, they kicked up clouds of dust, and the force of each impact was astonishing, equal to the power between Golden Core and Nascent Soul. Unfortunately, this mountain-moving formation was inanimate, took too long, and could not be moved. The young sword immortal who deserved a thousand cuts didn’t enter the boundaries of Jihuan Mountain. The grand display of the mountain-moving formation turned into a joke and mere decoration, and Xia Zhen used it to vent his pent-up fury.

Within a thousand miles, the earth trembled under the tremendous commotion.

Ye Han and the others were on high alert.

Ultimately, Xia Zhen was about to uproot Jihuan Mountain beneath his feet and transport it into the clouds to drop it from a great height. 

But Xia Zhen frowned.

On the mountain path, two figures walked down, or rather, three.

A pair of daoist partners, a man and a woman, stood side by side, chatting and laughing, the woman cradling a swaddled infant in her arms, her gaze tender. 

The woman wore an exceptionally long, snow-white sword at her waist. 

Xia Zhen felt a tingling sensation on his scalp. 

As for the man, he made Xia Zhen’s back feel cold.

The man complained, "What’s going on? You’ve disturbed my and Li’s child. Now I have to make funny faces for a good while to calm him down again."

At that moment, Xia Zhen truly felt despair. 

The woman, addressed as Sister Li by the man, if she was indeed the one he suspected, today would surely be a day he couldn’t escape with his life.

In the central region of the northern Julu Island, there was a female sword immortal named Li Cai. 

Her innate flying sword was named Snowflake.

Her pendant sword was called Frost Serpent.

She was among the sword immortals who had not gone to the Upside Down Mountain and remained in northern Julu Island.

To show respect, the title of sword immortal was elevated to great sword immortal. 

Though it sounded forced, the power behind it was undoubtedly real.

Each of the upper fifth-tier sword immortals in northern Julu Island had no hint of falsehood; the Jade Pure realm practitioners, such as the one from the Qionglin Sect, would not even look down upon a Golden Core sword cultivator. Even if they won, it would be looked down upon as shameful. Yet if a new sword cultivator managed to enter the Jade Pure realm, they would inevitably have to fight a few battles against other sword immortals. If they died, it would be deemed unfortunate; they had no right to stick their necks out if their skills were lacking. If they survived, they would earn their place standing together on the land of northern Julu Island. 

Xia Zhen gritted his teeth and faced the mountain path, bowing, "Greetings, Great Sword Immortal Li. Greetings, Senior Jiang."

Jiang Shangzhen wore a playful grin, "Oh, so now you know to call me Senior?"

The woman frowned, "If it weren’t for the fact that you’re somewhat sensible and notified me with the flying sword, you’d have been dead by now. You wild cultivator, do you understand etiquette? Rearranging the order."

Xia Zhen almost exploded on the spot, trembling as he replied, "Greetings, Senior Jiang. Greetings, Great Sword Immortal Li!"

Jiang Shangzhen patted the woman’s arm, "Don’t be like that. You know what kind of person I am, Sister Li. I’ve never cared for such empty formalities."

The woman huffed coldly, "We’ll settle your accounts later. Whether or not you want to go to Shujian Lake and show off your might, that’s up to you."

Jiang Shangzhen appeared unfazed, bending down to lift the edge of the swaddle, gently smiling, "Little girl, your newly recognized mother is angry. Grow up quickly, so you can help your father plead for leniency."

The woman’s lips twitched, rising and falling.

Pity Xia Zhen was on the verge of madness.

Jiang Shangzhen turned to Xia Zhen, "You’re like I was back in the day, able to fight and run. That’s commendable, which is why I kept half your life. I thought that once I met Sister Li and we traveled south, you would be calm. I wouldn’t hold it against you too much. But alas, your escape skills are only half of what I had back then, and your brain... it’s become mush. That national teacher from Dream Grain Kingdom spoke so many earnest words to you, treating you like his own son, yet you didn’t absorb a single word. Back in northern Julu Island, I met many who sought death and helped them fulfill their wishes, but one like you seeking death in so many ways is truly rare."

Xia Zhen spoke solemnly, "I implore Senior Jiang to give me one last chance!"

Jiang Shangzhen laughed, "The great sword immortal from the north has truly been secretly seduced by you, but my wife and I are united against our enemies. We barely managed to fend him off. In the central region, near the great river, a massive riverbed and hole have been carved out. There should already be a large lake there. Don’t you think it’s amusing? It’s quite a feat for a sword immortal to go to such lengths just to kill me, Jiang Shangzhen, while still hiding in the shadows. Thankfully, Sister Li is familiar with his sword intent; otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to lose an arm or a leg in northern Julu Island. That sword immortal would have likely crashed into a block of tofu and died on his own. The danger was perilous! You, Xia Zhen, truly are an unrelenting character. I’m afraid of you, alright? I’m really afraid!"

Xia Zhen no longer hesitated, knowing there was no chance for a peaceful resolution!

With a loud bang, countless copies of Xia Zhen emerged from his true form, some flying on wind, some running wildly, and others burrowing underground, all scattering in every direction. As long as he could escape one, he could survive! This technique, which came at a great cost, would indeed injure him further, but it was better than being killed by two upper fifth-tier practitioners.

Jiang Shangzhen exclaimed in surprise, "You didn’t use this method of escape last time! What a great fellow! No wonder you’re considered a celestial being in the eyes of these ants; you really scared me."

The female sword immortal beside Jiang Shangzhen tugged at her lips, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword, and gently produced a sound of resonance, but the sword remained sheathed.

Surrounding Jihuan Mountain, the skies echoed with the arrival of numerous snow-white sword energies, whether straight, serpentine, or drifting in the air.

In an instant, all was silent.

Jiang Shangzhen extended a hand, capturing a Golden Core and a tiny person the size of a rice grain, placing them into his sleeve’s mini-realm. Then he grabbed the limp horned blue snake on the ground and tucked it away, muttering in annoyance, "What a bother! I’ve got to make money and obtain treasures again!"

The female sword immortal Li Cai glared at him.

Jiang Shangzhen called out softly to the infant in the swaddle, lightly mentioning the name he had just given, smiling, "It’s fine, it’s fine. This little girl will serve as her future dowry."

Li Cai glanced at the three figures, finding them somewhat annoying, and asked impatiently, "What should we do about these three frogs at the bottom of the well?"

Jiang Shangzhen glanced at the three.

They were all kneeling mid-air.

Xia Zhen was a mountain of a celestial being in their eyes.

Was it really possible for him to perish in the blink of an eye?

Jiang Shangzhen’s movements were gentle as he helped Li Cai brush off a sleeve, "How about we let this go? After all, we’re in front of our daughter..."

In the midst of his speech, a willow leaf instantly pierced through the brows of Ye Han and Fan Weiran, finally embedding itself in Jiang Shangzhen’s body. He smiled, "It’s fine. The little girl is sleeping; she can’t see."

The corpses of the two Golden Core practitioners fell to the foot of Jihuan Mountain.

Jiang Shangzhen did not even glance at them.

Their little possessions weren’t worth his time to bend down and reach for. Why waste his time and delay his chance to make great money?

Only the last figure remained, the second ancestor of Baotong Wonderland, a female cultivator of the Dragon Gate realm, still trembling and unable to rise.

The two began flying southward.

Li Cai found it all rather ordinary and displayed no surprise.

Had it not been for the loquacious man beside her, she might have died back at the bottleneck of the Golden Core realm.

That time, Jiang Shangzhen had lost half his life.

This was one of the few losses Jiang Shangzhen had encountered during his journey in northern Julu Island. 

But she still had no idea why he would go to such lengths.

It was true that he liked her back then, but it was similar to how he liked other beautiful women, perhaps just a little more, but it definitely shouldn’t have been to the point of risking his life for her.

For many years, she had wanted to know the answer and even made a special trip to Tongye Island. But on that trip, she never encountered Jiang Shangzhen. The old master of the Yu Gui Sect, Xun Yuan, said Jiang Shangzhen had gone to the Cloud Cave Blessed Land and wouldn’t be returning for a while. The old master even scolded Jiang Shangzhen, claiming that such a heartless and ungrateful bastard deserved to die in the Cloud Cave Blessed Land, and that Miss Li would dirty her eyes even looking at him. The Blessed Land nearly fell into chaos because of him, almost leading her to her demise...

But Li Cai knew that the old master still had a soft spot for Jiang Shangzhen, hinting at many things about her, clearly hoping she wouldn’t give up on him.

However, after reuniting with Jiang Shangzhen, the now central female sword immortal of northern Julu Island no longer desired to know the answer.

Li Cai turned her head to ask, "Aren’t you going to greet them?"

Jiang Shangzhen shook his head, "I have too much entanglement with He Xiaolian. Since you’re by my side, I’m not afraid of trouble, but you are a practitioner here. I can’t drag you into this."

Li Cai smiled slightly.

She suddenly furrowed her brow and questioned, "Regarding the heavenly tribulation in the City of the Holy Guard, I observed the aftermath in the cloud sea. Even weaker Nascent Souls faced immense trouble. How did you fend it off?"

Jiang Shangzhen laughed, "What else could be done? I fought with all my strength. Sincerity brings results; you have to believe occasionally. Man’s calculations are not as good as heaven’s; geographical advantages pale against heavenly principles. The truth lies in that. That person impersonating the national teacher of Dream Grain Kingdom grasped only a minor aspect. Peering into the heavens from the Nascent Soul realm is quite challenging, so he naturally has a far broader future than Xia Zhen."

Li Cai nodded in agreement.

Suddenly, Jiang Shangzhen said, "I’ve heard you’ve taken on an excellent female disciple. She is expected to join the next generation’s ten elite."

Li Cai’s expression turned strange.

Jiang Shangzhen rolled his eyes, "What are you worried about? A rabbit doesn’t eat the grass near its burrow. A mountain head only likes one, and that’s the principle by which I, Jiang Shangzhen, have walked the mountains swiftly for a thousand years without faltering!"

Li Cai’s face was icy as she pressed on, "What do you mean by asking this?"

Jiang Shangzhen laughed, "I’m worried she might follow in my footsteps and fall for a good man worth a thousand pieces of gold."

Li Cai shook her head, "My disciple’s determination of heart is stronger than mine was back then. She’ll never like anyone in this lifetime. The idea that a good woman fears a clingy man doesn’t apply to her."

Jiang Shangzhen laughed heartily, "You’re wrong. I’m afraid she’ll cling to my good man brother."

Li Cai couldn’t help but chuckle.

Jiang Shangzhen playfully said, "Sister Li, let’s make a bet. If I lose, I’ll let you decide my fate. But if you lose, you’ll become a nominal devotee of my new sect at Shujian Lake?"

Li Cai nodded, "Alright!"

Jiang Shangzhen looked at her strangely, "I thought you’d be more hesitant to accept this bet, given my gambling skills and luck that you experienced firsthand."

Li Cai smiled, "My disciple needs thirty years of closed-door cultivation. Can that young man wander around northern Julu Island for thirty years?"

Jiang Shangzhen grabbed Li Cai’s sleeve, "Good sister, please spare me this time?"

Li Cai’s expression fell as she asked, "Can’t you just like one person?"

Jiang Shangzhen smiled, "Let’s talk about it once you surpass me by a realm."

Li Cai sighed, severing some ripples with her heart sword, and together with Jiang Shangzhen, they headed to the Bone Beach, planning to take the cross-continent ferry of the Pima Sect to Baoping Continent.

It was said that this rascal was heading to a place called Luopo Mountain in the Longquan Prefecture of Dali, seeking a nominal title as a devotee with the identity of a Nascent Soul practitioner.

From his tone, it seemed he might not succeed. 

Li Cai glanced at Jiang Shangzhen, who was deep in thought.

When he smiled and conversed with others, he was infuriating. 

But when he wasn’t smiling, he was very serious.

It was said that this man, throughout his life, could never let go of a common girl from the foot of the mountain, and he had never touched her, only watching her marry and have children, growing old gracefully, passing away peacefully without disaster.

Li Cai hesitated and asked, "Jiang Shangzhen, if you encountered the same girl today, would you still like her so much?"

Jiang Shangzhen shook his head, "Naturally not."

Li Cai was puzzled.

Jiang Shangzhen spoke slowly, "In life’s first encounters, seeing a girl in the mountains, witnessing the grandeur of the rivers and mountains when climbing high, gazing at immortal beings riding clouds, and seeing the sun and moon suspended in the sky—all these experiences differ greatly from seeing similar scenes later in life. It’s not necessarily that those first encounters were beautiful, but that feeling lingers in the heart, haunting for hundreds of years and difficult to forget."

Jiang Shangzhen chuckled again, turning his head, "Just like when I first met Sister Li, stepping on fragrant stairs, holding golden-threaded shoes..."

Li Cai snapped, "Shut your mouth!"

Jiang Shangzhen softly replied, "Don’t be shy, my dear. Your husband’s heart is in disarray." 

*(End of this chapter)*

 Chapter 597: The Good-hearted Young Girl (Part Two)

In the Kingdom of Huaihuang, Yuhu County.

At the city gate of the county, a number of official and wealthy family notices were posted, all requesting skilled practitioners to perform rituals in their homes, with promises of generous monetary rewards at the end, though the exact amount of silver was never specified.

Chen Ping'an carefully examined those notices under the wall, and it seemed that the county was quite chaotic both inside and out.

After purchasing some provisions in the county, Chen Ping'an settled into an inn for the night. Under the cover of darkness, he quietly sipped wine atop the roof.

As expected, in the late hours of the night, a flash of white darted across the streets, a ghostly figure with an elongated tongue and a twisted face. She floated just above the ground, drifting aimlessly; however, her malevolence was only faint. She avoided any house adorned with door gods, regardless of whether they exuded even a trace of spiritual energy. The county's watchmen had been replaced by two brave young men, full of vigor, who had been given a bonus from the government to buy two pots of wine daily. The white-clad hanging ghost had attempted to approach them several times, but was repelled by their intangible yang energy. After several failed attempts, she reluctantly retreated to scratch at the doors and walls of poorer households. Some deep sleepers, snoring thunderously, remained completely unaware of the disturbances, while the lighter sleepers trembled in fear, prompting her to cackle with delight, which only made the situation more disturbing.

Seeing that the hanging ghost did not truly enter a home to cause harm, Chen Ping'an chose to ignore it. 

Lying on the eaves, he crossed his legs and gently waved a folding fan, creating a light breeze.

The most daunting aspect of a tangled web is its length—when the two ends are unclear, once it reaches the heavens and descends to the underworld, the realities of past lives become uncertain. 

It is even worse when the threads intertwine, branching into countless fine lines, blurring the lines between good and evil, becoming a chaotic mess. 

Especially when a single line is pulled taut; the further one looks, the more exhausting it becomes. 

Just like that ghost terrifying the people; any practitioner who kills her would not be wrong—accumulating merit is justified. But if one were to consider the broader picture, the common people surrounding Yuhu County would come to understand that there are indeed ghosts in the world. In the future, when malice strikes and they wish to do evil, shouldn't they weigh the concepts of karma and the cycle of reincarnation? As long as that ghost wanders at night and has not truly harmed anyone, how should one judge right from wrong? Or perhaps, what grievances did she suffer to end up hanging herself, her obsession refusing to dissipate and becoming a ghost?

Chen Ping'an closed his eyes and slept soundly until dawn.

In cultivation, every moment is an opportunity, so how one travels or the pace at which one moves is of little consequence.

That morning, as Chen Ping'an was leaving the city, he saw a group of four individuals boldly tearing down an official notice, seemingly intent on confronting the ghosts that had taken over the local temple.

Chen Ping'an felt puzzled. The four consisted of two women and two men, dressed modestly—not pretending to be poor, but genuinely lacking wealth. The oldest was a middle-aged man of the second realm in martial arts, and the young boy was likely his disciple, barely qualifying as a simple martial artist. As for the two female figures, they appeared to be sisters, just beginning their journey on the path of cultivation, with their spiritual energy almost negligible.

If the master from Dream Liang Country, who had disguised himself as a storyteller, was able to discern the boy's second realm cultivation and still felt cautious, it was largely due to his aura. 

These four, however, truly lacked depth in their cultivation.

Dealing with the white-clad hanging ghost drifting through the county should not be too difficult, but the temple outside the city was clearly teeming with malevolent spirits, bold enough to occupy a temple that had once been quite prosperous, driving away all the monks. The four would likely struggle against it; if they weren’t careful and lacked some life-saving tricks, they might just end up as dumplings in the stew there.

After some thought, Chen Ping'an decided not to leave the city immediately. Instead, he listened to their whispered conversations, which were filled with mundane discussions about buying yellow paper to draw talismans and grinding their gold ingots into gold powder. A girl with rosy cheeks from the cold suggested they should seek some deposit from the government and borrow some incense-related items from the county's ghost temple and the martial deity temple to ensure a greater chance of success at Jinda Temple.

The boy complained about why they didn’t subdue the fox spirits and rabbit demons instead, as the rewards from the government and wealthy families would surely be easier and less risky.

The tall, middle-aged woman quietly explained to the boy that if the ghosts in Jinda Temple caught wind of their plans, they would only heighten their defenses, making success even more difficult.

Chen Ping'an listened to their serious tones; there was no hint of levity, quite different from the heroic demeanor of the man who had torn down the notice.

So, he left the county and headed towards Jinda Temple, located about thirty miles away.

He waited at a roadside pavilion about seven or eight miles from the temple, where the sound of a mountain stream could be heard flowing softly nearby.

He waited until midday before spotting the four figures approaching.

Without waiting for them to get close, he set off for Jinda Temple, carrying a bamboo box on his back and a walking stick in hand, slowing his pace as if he were a frail scholar struggling to walk.

The four quickly caught up with him, brushing past. The lead man, holding a large incense holder, glanced at him but quickly looked away. The seemingly naive boy flashed a grin, and the scholar returned the smile, which only made the boy beam even more, unable to close his mouth even after turning away.

The older woman frowned but said nothing. Her younger sister wanted to speak but was tugged at the sleeve by her, signaling her not to get involved. The girl then stopped but turned back a few steps later, unable to resist asking, "Hey, scholar, are you going to Jinda Temple to burn incense? Don't you know that all the people of Yuhu County have stopped going? Are you trying to steal the first incense?"

The scholar wiped the sweat from his forehead, gasping for breath, and replied, "I just arrived in Yuhu County. A friend of mine is acquainted with the monks at Jinda Temple and said I could stay there to study. It's peaceful and doesn't cost any silver."

The girl was about to say something when her sister pinched her arm, causing her face to scrunch up in pain. She turned and whispered, "Sister, during the day, there shouldn't be any temple ghosts probing for information nearby. If this scholar follows us to Jinda Temple, when we end up fighting those ghosts, should we save him or not? That would be so troublesome. If we don't save him, it would just be killing the monsters for silver, but I wouldn't be able to feel right about it. I should warn him not to go and risk his life for nothing. Why does he have to barge into a ghost's lair when there are so many other places to study? With his kind of luck, he definitely won't have a bright future."

Her sister sighed and flicked her finger against the girl's forehead, "Try to say less. If you stop the scholar, you can't act recklessly anymore. This trip to Jinda Temple, you must listen to me!"

The girl cheered up, slowing her pace to walk alongside the scholar, drifting further away from the other three.

Her first question was full of energy, "Scholar, are you married? What do you think of my sister's looks?"

The traveling scholar chuckled, "Please, don’t joke around, young lady."

The girl suddenly laughed, "I’m just teasing you."

Then she turned serious, "But this isn’t a joke. Jinda Temple is very dangerous right now. A large group of fierce ghosts has emerged, driving the monks away in the twilight. Even a monk skilled in Buddhism was killed on the spot, along with many monks and worshippers who couldn't escape. They’ve taken over the temple and really feast on people, so you shouldn't go. There isn't a single bald monk left in the temple. I’m not trying to scare you; if you don’t believe me, you can ask around in the county. If I’m lying, you may just be making a fruitless trip, but if I’m not, wouldn’t you be risking your life for nothing? How could you ever pursue your ambitions and bring glory to your family then?"

The scholar asked, "Then how are you going to burn incense?"

The girl stomped her foot, "Can’t you see that we are capable of subduing demons?!"

The scholar paused for a moment, then laughed, "Where do such demons and monsters come from? Don’t deceive me, young lady."

The man and woman ahead exchanged glances and shook their heads.

The boy even pulled at the corner of his mouth.

Only the rosy-cheeked girl became a bit flustered, "My sister says that scholars are stubborn and hard to turn back. If you keep being so reckless, I might have to knock you out and leave you by the pavilion. But that would be risky, too. If a ghost or two happen to escape at night and catch the scent of a human, you’d still be dead. You, scholar, really need to hurry and leave!"

The scholar replied foolishly, "I’m quite hungry right now and don’t have any way to make the round trip to the county. I just want to take a look at Jinda Temple. If there really aren’t any worshippers or monks, I’ll turn around and leave immediately."

The girl sighed, "My sister said that those high-level ghosts can wield divine powers, and their malevolence can obscure the heavens, blocking out the sun. When that happens, how could you escape?"

The girl called out ahead, "Sister, I think we should take this fool back to the county. I can definitely run fast enough to reach Jinda Temple before dark."

Her sister snapped back, "We chose the timing for a reason! I’m worried that the ghosts in the temple can show themselves during the day. We should try to stick more talismans and prepare more charms. If those fierce ghosts can manipulate the clouds to cover the temple, what will we do without you? Are you planning to help us collect the bodies afterwards? Have you forgotten the last incident?!"

The girl fell silent, saying "Oh," with a downcast face, turning to the scholar, "Scholar, let’s go. We don’t know each other and have no intention of making fun of you or deceiving you about the ghosts at Jinda Temple."

However, the scholar, frustratingly stubborn, insisted on wanting to see Jinda Temple’s entrance.

She wanted to punch him, but he took it kindly, and she couldn’t just stand there watching him take risks.

Unexpectedly, that bookish fool took a step back, saying, "Miss, please don’t hit me. A gentleman uses words, not violence. If you knock me out and I fall at the pavilion, what if someone steals my bamboo box? Who will pay for it?"

The girl turned and quickly followed her sister, wiping her face with a hand.

She couldn’t believe there was such a heartless person in the world.

She was almost heartbroken.

But she couldn’t help but look back; the fellow was still following them.

As she hesitated whether to give him a good punch, he suddenly stopped moving forward.

The girl was about to scold him again when her sister grabbed her arm, "Enough with the nonsense!"

The girl lowered her head.

Chen Ping'an smiled knowingly.

It seemed he had disappointed a good person.

He continued to follow slowly behind, the distance between them growing larger.

The girl was about to turn back when her sister angrily scolded, "You want to get us killed, don’t you? Aren’t you afraid that he’s actually a ghostly minion of evil?"

The girl finally stopped turning back.

She walked with her head down, kicking small stones along the way.

Her sister sighed, "With your temperament, you’ll end up suffering greatly sooner or later. Haven’t we encountered enough instances of good intentions leading to bad outcomes on this journey?"

The girl replied softly, "Oh," without refuting.

In the distance, the white-clad scholar was bored, idly pushing stones back into place with his walking stick, smiling, "Is that really the case?"

As they approached Jinda Temple, the girl secretly turned back. The winding mountain path had already hidden the scholar's figure from view.

After walking another mile, their view opened up. The young woman’s expression turned serious, "We’ve arrived."

The man nodded.

Inside Jinda Temple, a faint aura of malevolence swirled, but it was extremely thin, dissipating with the wind. The woman wondered, "Something doesn’t seem right. When we looked at the temple from afar last night, the aura of evil shouldn’t be this sparse."

The man pondered for a moment before saying, "That’s a good sign. Perhaps the bright sun has forced those filthy ghosts underground, giving us a chance to set our talismans and scatter the glutinous rice and dog blood. You two will need to arrange the formation. When dusk arrives and there's still some sunlight remaining, we can use thunderous methods to draw them out from the earth. Without the advantage of time and place, we’ll have the upper hand."

The young woman nodded and turned to her eager sister, "Stay alert and don’t let your guard down. The ghosts are crafty; if Jinda Temple is truly a trap to lure us in, we’ll be in big trouble."

The girl’s eyes sparkled, "Sister, don’t worry!"

Upon reaching the entrance of Jinda Temple, the rosy-cheeked girl nimbly leaped onto the wall. On the ground before the main hall lay many white bones, likely belonging to the unfortunate monks and worshippers. She quickly threw a yellow paper talisman inscribed with expensive gold powder, which stuck firmly to the main hall's doorframe without showing any signs of burning. Moments later, she turned around and said, "There are currently no ghosts in the front hall. Uncle Song can safely stick his talismans on the temple door, and inside we can just scatter rice around the walls."

The two sisters then began to move quickly, entering the temple first, searching for common places to post yellow paper talismans. Only in significant areas, like the main hall door and plaque, did they place rare talismans made from ground gold powder and vermilion ink.

The master and disciple, meanwhile, casually tossed incense sticks, removing their bundles to take out bags filled with aged glutinous rice and several water skins containing black dog blood, beginning to "set up their formation" in the familiar surroundings of the front hall.

By the time they reached the far end of the spacious temple, the four regrouped, all safe and sound.

Only in a closed side hall did the girl say the malevolence was heavy, so they worked together to stick dozens of yellow paper talismans on the doors and windows. The young woman personally placed talismans on the roof, while the girl started to remove tiles one by one, allowing sunlight to pour into the side hall. Inside, they heard the sounds of wailing and the hissing of black mist being scorched to ash by the sunlight.

At last, the four gathered at the entrance of the side hall.

They exchanged smiles.

The young woman held a binding rope she had bought at great expense, costing forty snowflake coins!

Her sister was even more peculiar; earlier, she had been mumbling to herself, squatting on the ground, and after untying a knot from a embroidered bag, various ancient coins began to roll and scatter.

As for the master and disciple, they were empty-handed. However, the man had a circle of throwing darts hanging from his waist, inscribed with talismanic text, clearly not mundane weapons of the martial world.

The young woman and the man exchanged smiles.

It seemed the malevolence of the ghosts in the temple was not as profound as they had anticipated, and they were particularly fearful of sunlight. Furthermore, it appeared that there were not dozens of fierce spirits gathered at Jinda Temple; the common people of Yuhu County had exaggerated their fears, leading to their opportunity for profit.

They had struck gold!

It would not be an exaggeration to say they were experiencing good fortune!

Earlier at the county magistrate's office, they had haggled and deceived the cautious official, ultimately securing the government's promise of five thousand taels of silver. If this was all they received, it would hardly be worth the effort, even if they suppressed the ghosts at Jinda Temple. If any injuries were sustained, it would be even less acceptable. However, besides the magistrate's bounty, there was also a significant additional income: the governor's agreement to provide another sum of thirty thousand taels, which the wealthy worshippers in the city were willing to contribute. With all this, the risk of venturing to Jinda Temple became worthwhile.

Unexpectedly, they had stumbled upon a great opportunity.

The man was overjoyed, surveying his surroundings with satisfaction. Once they dealt with the ghosts in the side hall, they could return home and demand those thirty-five thousand taels of silver from the magistrate. According to their prior agreement, the master and disciple would each be entitled to over ten thousand taels.

Indeed, today was an auspicious day for slaying demons!

Next, both sides began to take real action. As the girl’s coins circled around the side hall, they stood upright. After she pressed her fingers together and silently recited a mantra, they instantly drilled into the ground. The girl’s face turned a little pale as she looked towards her sister.

The young woman nodded and softly said to the man, "My sister and I will first go to the roof to test the depth of the ghosts. If they are forced out, you must act immediately; don’t let them escape underground. If they refuse to come out, while the sun is still high, just tear down this side hall. My sister's coins can serve as a prison beneath the earth, but they won’t hold for long. So when the time comes, you must act quickly."

The man nodded but reminded her, "Don’t worry."

The sisters climbed onto the roof of the side hall again, tossing yellow paper talismans inside, occasionally mixing in a precious talisman inscribed with gold powder.

The boy also took out a bronze mirror, tilting the surface to reflect light towards various windows of the side hall.

Not far away, a white-clad scholar with a bamboo box was actually sitting on a nearby roof, but his body was covered by a talisman, and with the four's cultivation level, they could naturally not see him.

What followed was a fierce battle.

Thick black smoke billowed into the sky. Even when besieged by talismans, the young woman wielded the binding rope to scatter the black mist, and the boy shone the mirror to scorch it. Yet, even as the black mist seemed to escape the side hall, it continued to run rampant. After the black smoke was disrupted by the binding ropes, talismans, and the mirror, it transformed into a space reminiscent of a "ghost wall," ensnaring the four. Even as the girl desperately controlled her talismans, they only became slender fire dragons, unable to break through the wall of black mist shielding the sunlight, putting them in grave danger. The sisters and the master and disciple fought back to back, already injured; the girl, in a bid to save the boy holding the mirror, was struck in the back by a black mist, spitting out blood, yet she struggled to rise and continued to retrieve more of her drawn yellow paper talismans, casting them with hand signs, ultimately transforming into a talismanic fire dragon, depleting her own spiritual energy to protect the four.

The white-clad scholar frowned, slapped his forehead, and helplessly said, "With your limited skills, you dare to come to Jinda Temple to slay demons? I’ve already killed most of the fierce spirits for you."

He smiled slightly and snapped his fingers.

The previously unbound black mist suddenly stagnated, landing to become a fierce spirit standing over ten feet tall. With the bright sun overhead, it was finally vanquished by the four in their perilous battle.

The girl bent over, wiping the blood from the corners of her mouth and nose, and beamed, "Sister, did I slow you down this time?!"

The young woman, having survived the ordeal, rushed to her side, supporting her sister, who was on the verge of collapsing, and glared, "What’s with the heroics? Say less and focus on healing."

The boy looked at the shattered mirror in his hand and then glanced at his wheezing master, who paused for a moment, then, seeing the fierce look in the boy’s eyes, nodded gently.

The man surveyed the surroundings and laughed heartily, "Miss Xining, Miss Quan, now that the heavens are clear, it’s obvious the demons have been eliminated. Why don’t we take a day to rest in the temple and head back to the county tomorrow?"

The young woman frowned, "Although the malevolence at Jinda Temple has dissipated, it has been occupied by fierce ghosts for a long time. If there’s still a fish that slipped through the net, my sister and I have already used up our talismans and would be unable to fight again. It would be wise to return to the county promptly."

The boy shook his head, replying, "Sister Xining, if we leave too early, the county magistrate will mistakenly believe we easily vanquished the demons. If we encounter a shameless one, five thousand taels of silver is still manageable since it's in black and white, but whether the magistrate will pocket the thirty thousand taels is uncertain. We must stay here today, not only to dismantle some of the temple walls but also to deliberately inform the magistrate that one or two fierce spirits escaped so we can ask for an additional five thousand taels for thorough extermination."

The girl rolled her eyes and quickly covered her mouth, turning away as she spat blood, feeling a bit embarrassed.

The young woman contemplated this for a moment, then nodded and smiled, "Then it’s settled. We’ll return to the county tomorrow; we’ll just rest in the temple tonight, perfect for my sister to recuperate."

At that moment, a flustered white-clad scholar rushed in from the side path of the front hall, "Why are there so many white bones on the ground in the temple's front hall? Why isn't there a single monk in sight… Could it be that demons are causing trouble…"

The girl was quite annoyed with him, but upon seeing him alive and well, she felt a bit reassured.

Afterward, the master and disciple tidied up the remaining talismans and packed the aged glutinous rice back into bags for future use.

The young woman found a secluded room in the temple for wealthy worshippers to reside and copy scriptures. The girl sat cross-legged in the corridor, beginning her breathing exercises.

Her sister continued to patrol the area, cautious of any unexpected occurrences.

The cowardly scholar insisted on following them, taking the bamboo box and sitting on the steps as if guarding the entrance.

In the dusk, the young woman returned, having scavenged some valuable scriptures and items, which she stuffed into a large bundle.

The girl opened her eyes and smiled at the scholar’s back, "It’s almost nighttime, soon there will be fierce ghosts causing a ruckus; why aren’t you running away?"

The white-clad scholar turned around, smiling at her, "The books say that people fear ghosts, but ghosts fear human hearts even more. However, I believe you are a good person, so it’s better for me to stay by your side."

The girl strained to think and raised her fist, "Are you praising me or scolding me? If you keep this nonsense up, you’d better watch out for a punch from me; who knows, you might even get top marks on the imperial examination!"

The scholar, who truly was a clueless bookworm, laughed, "I see you act with integrity and kindness; you’re not worse than a gentleman."

The young woman was displeased, "Since you call yourself a gentleman, you should know the proprieties between men and women. Why do you still stubbornly linger here? Is it appropriate?"

The girl thought the scholar seemed to have become a bit smarter, as he said, "I’m not a gentleman; I’m just a poor scholar. If there are indeed ghosts at Jinda Temple, I can’t run out and risk my life; it’s better to stay here."

The young woman glared, "Leave!"

The girl was about to speak when her sister’s fierce glare silenced her.

The scholar could only retreat timidly, clutching his bamboo box as he walked out of the courtyard.

Most likely, he was thinking about his actions against the wall?

The girl whispered, "Sister, why be so fierce? He’s just a bookworm."

The young woman frowned, "You need to focus on healing. You can’t afford to overlook anything. His presence on the incense path is already suspicious, and following us into Jinda Temple is even more unusual. If it weren’t for him being ahead of us on this path, I wouldn’t even hesitate to take action against him."

She gently said, "Alright, you should rest."

The girl nodded but still cast sidelong glances toward the courtyard door.

Her sister laughed in frustration, "There are no ghosts left; it’s just us five living people. He’s merely spending a night outside, so why worry about him instead of your own sister? Don't you care about us fighting alongside you? Are you falling for him just because he’s a scholar? I told you, scholars are the least reliable!"

The girl pleaded, "Alright, alright, I’ll focus on my training!"

Night fell heavily.

The girl sat quietly in the corridor, focusing on her breathing, her mind immersed.

The young woman sat on the steps, slightly resting but not daring to fall into a deep sleep.

After all, they were in Jinda Temple.

Suddenly, a flurry of darts flew in from the courtyard entrance.

A familiar figure approached, striding forward confidently.

Though the young woman was startled, she still waved her wide sleeves, dispersing the sharp darts.

A dagger was hurled directly at her sister’s neck, propelled with great force by a boy squatting atop the wall.

The young woman allowed one dart to pierce her shoulder, sweeping past as she caught the dagger that was inches away from her sister’s neck. However, the pure martial artist had already stepped up beside her, his fist smashing into her temple, sending her crashing through the wall and most of the window, bleeding profusely, struggling several times, unable to rise.

The boy lightly leaped down from the wall, grinning wickedly, "Master, can we not kill Quan? It would be best if Sister Xining were also knocked out; just disable these two cultivators!"

The man raised his hand towards the girl who had interrupted her breathing exercises, shaking his head, "This little girl is trickier. I’ll leave her sister to you."

The boy laughed, "We’ll have both wealth and beauty!"

The man abruptly turned, gripping the girl’s neck and looking toward the courtyard entrance.

The boy quickly joined him.

At the courtyard entrance, a head poked out timidly, "In the Buddhist temple's pure land, isn’t what you’re doing rather inappropriate?"

The girl with a pale face moved her lips as if to warn the foolish scholar to run away quickly.

The man seemed to notice the girl’s expression, pausing for a moment, "This good-hearted young lady wants me to save you? Don’t worry; I’m a person of chivalry. I’ve read many sage texts, and I must confess, I’ve accumulated a bellyful of righteousness. Swift and agile as the wind…"

The girl desperately wanted to shake her head, tears sliding down her cheeks.

The young girl with rosy cheeks looked quite adorable.

The man’s eyes slowly narrowed, shedding the foolishness he had displayed earlier. He boldly stepped out from the courtyard, raising a hand and snapping his fingers, "Come out! Some living people ought to be devoured by the ghosts of the underworld."

The master and disciple saw the worthless scholar's back, from which a fierce ghost over ten feet tall timidly emerged, far more threatening than the previous one.

The man immediately released his grip on the girl's neck, "So you’re actually the ghost king here. It’s all a misunderstanding. We meant no offense; we’re just two cultivators seeking merit and rewards…"

The fierce ghost transformed into a swirling mass of black smoke, instantly enveloping the man, accompanied by the sounds of flesh tearing, bones shattering, and his heart-wrenching screams.

The boy, surprisingly unafraid, gathered his strength and leaped onto the wall, quickly fleeing.

It seemed the fierce ghost had received a command, releasing the already deceased man and darting out of the courtyard in pursuit, and soon the sounds of a horrific struggle echoed.

Then, a beam of sword light descended from the sky. The ghost outside let out a howl that echoed through the heavens and the earth, likely audible in the county, surely frightening countless citizens, but soon after, there was silence.

The girl stared wide-eyed, asking foolishly, "You’re the ghost king?"

The scholar smiled, sitting on the steps, and countered, "What do you think?"

The girl suddenly said, "Don’t eat me! I’ll go check on my sister first."

The scholar nodded, "Alright."

The girl wanted to glare at him, but recalling he was probably the ghost king of Jinda Temple, she hurried to check on her sister, helping her out of the room.

The young woman offered a bitter smile, waiting for death.

She had seen everything clearly from the sounds outside.

The girl looked at the blood-soaked remains on the ground, her expression complicated, her eyes dim.

How could this happen?

They hadn’t died at the hands of the ghosts, but almost fell victim to the very master and disciple they had traversed Huaihuang Kingdom with for so long. 

They had seemed quite decent before.

As they exited the room, the white-clad scholar stood up and walked towards the courtyard, turning to the young girl, "You’ll definitely hear your sister sound more resolute, saying that there are always so many bad people in the world. Little girl, you don’t need to feel disappointed. The affairs of the world are either always like this or they’re right. No matter how much you’ve seen or encountered, again and again, one after another, remember that you are still right."

He took out a conical hat and placed it on his head, "Look, good deeds are rewarded and evil deeds are punished; at least tonight, that’s true."

After exiting the courtyard, the man suddenly leaned back, a bright smile on his face, "Little girl, you look so beautiful! You’ll surely find your ideal partner in the future."

The girl chuckled through her tears, wiping her face, "You’re such a nuisance!"

Suddenly, the girl recalled the flash of golden light, her eyes sparkling, "You’re actually a sword immortal, aren’t you?"

The man slowly straightened up, smiling, "I’m just a foolish scholar who happens to be a swordsman."

After that, the man transformed into a white rainbow, soaring into the sky, heading north.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 598: The Splendor of Human Lanterns

To the north of Huaihuang Kingdom lay the prosperous Baoxiang Kingdom, a land where Buddhism thrived and temples dotted the landscape like clouds.

Chen Pingan had crossed through the border checkpoint, where he still carried the newly issued travel documents, having acquired them from Wei Bo. The previous document, now adorned with a myriad of stamps, was left behind at the bamboo tower.

With a bamboo box strapped to his back and a wide-brimmed hat atop his head, Chen Pingan wielded a walking staff as he traversed mountains and rivers, venturing alone into the unknown. Occasionally, he would soar through the skies on his sword, but for the most part, he walked on foot. Even now, he was still quite a distance from the Spring Dew Garden where the Golden Core cultivator Song Lanqiao was situated.

In the marketplaces, one often found many who resembled one another—hunchbacks among hunchbacks, the lame among the lame.

This was true of those who walked the path of immortality; they encountered more fellow cultivators, as well as strange creatures lurking in the mountains and valleys.

Having journeyed from the Silver Screen Kingdom to the border of Baoxiang Kingdom, Chen Pingan had already seen numerous spirits and monsters heading southward.

However, apart from a single incident involving the jade-tipped spear from Yuhuo County in Huaihuang, he merely observed from a distance, looking down from the peaks and adopting the mindset of a cultivator. 

Yet, he did not cease his training; after the incident in Ghost Valley, he began to focus on the Six Steps Stance, aiming to complete two million punches before moving on.

If he hadn’t encountered the group of four who specialized in slaying demons and monsters, he would have initially intended to deal with the specters alone. He had planned to wait for the monk's return, spending a few more days at the Golden Bell Temple to inquire about the Sanskrit content in the golden-lettered pages of a certain sutra. Given the limited number of characters—only 260—the task of breaking them down and asking the monk about them would not be overly difficult. Wealth can tempt the heart, and a single thought can give rise to demons; in this regard, the martial artist and disciple at Golden Bell Temple were a prime example.

After passing through two cities in southern Baoxiang Kingdom, Chen Pingan observed that many wandering monks frequented the area. Their faces were gaunt, and they begged for alms from all directions.

When he encountered them on the road, he would raise a hand in greeting and nod respectfully.

Baoxiang Kingdom was not among the ten or so kingdoms that included Silver Screen and Huaihuang, and thus the common folk and martial artists had long since become accustomed to the presence of spirits and demons. In the southeastern region of North Ju Lu Prefecture, humans and spirits had coexisted for countless years, leading to various coping strategies for dealing with malevolent entities. However, after the storyteller from Dream Liang Kingdom dismantled the Thunder Pool Great Array, spiritual energy began to flood into more than a dozen kingdoms. This phenomenon was first sensed by the cultivators along the borders, while the spirits and demons adept in their craft were not far behind. The bustling merchants sought profit, and demons would instinctively pursue spiritual energy, leading to strange occurrences in Huaihuang’s Buxiao and Yuhuo Counties, most of which stemmed from Baoxiang Kingdom.

This was what the young escort meant when he mentioned that the world was becoming increasingly chaotic.

As the sun set, Chen Pingan walked steadily toward a small, emerald lake known locally as Mute Lake for reasons unknown. 

A number of people had gathered by the lake once more, their bonfires crackling as they drank to ward off the chill.

That night, several beams of sword light suddenly ignited from the west, soaring toward Huangfeng Valley, landing on the ground several dozen miles from Mute Lake. The sword lights crisscrossed the sky, accompanied by the wails and howls of demons. About the time it takes to burn a stick of incense later, the brilliant sword lights vanished into the distance. During this commotion, the escort masters, who were skilled in some martial arts, along with passing merchants, remained surprisingly calm, continuing to drink and discuss which sect’s sword cultivators had come to practice their skills.

As the sword cultivators departed and night fell, few by the lake chose to rest early. Some mischievous children, wielding wooden swords and bamboo blades, challenged one another, kicking up clouds of yellow sand as they laughed and chased each other.

Chen Pingan sat by the lakeside, leaning against his bamboo box, sipping water from his sword nurturing gourd.

He noticed a woman in a hooded cloak stepping away from her group, crouching by the water's edge, attempting to scoop some water to wash her face. When she lifted one hand, a string of snow-white bells jingled at her wrist. As she lifted the edge of her cloak, Chen Pingan averted his gaze, looking back toward the supposedly bottomless Mute Lake. Local tales claimed that this small lake had never dried up in a thousand years; no matter how severe the drought, the water level remained unchanged, and during heavy rains, it would not rise a single inch.

A ripple suddenly appeared at the center of the lake, followed by a small black figure peeking out before quickly disappearing beneath the surface. The woman seemed oblivious, meticulously grooming her hair at her forehead and temples. Each time she raised her hand, the bells chimed softly, but their sound was drowned out by the laughter and revelry of those gathered by the lake.

Without warning, a massive whirlpool formed silently on the lake's surface, followed by the sudden emergence of a fish monster over ten feet long, its body as dark as ink. It opened its mouth wide, displaying teeth as sharp as blades.

Chen Pingan sat cross-legged, unmoving, resting his chin on one hand as he observed the standoff between the woman and the fish.

From eight directions around Mute Lake, eight figures appeared, each holding a compass. They smashed their compasses into the sandy ground, then stood firm, fingers forming seals as they stepped into stances. In an instant, a silver line shot toward the center of the lake. When the silver strings converged at a single point, a dazzling silver bagua formation appeared on the lake's surface, shining brightly in the moonlight.

The eight practitioners, evidently from the same sect, worked in perfect harmony. Each extended a hand to grasp a silver line that had emerged from the ground, then pointed upward at the lake's center, as if casting a net to catch a fish. Eight more silver lines flew out, forming a cage, and the eight began to spin around, continuously adding arcs to the formation. They showed no concern for the safety of the woman confronting the fish monster.

The fish monster, upon sensing danger the moment the compass struck the ground, quickly clamped its mouth shut. However, its massive inertia led it to charge toward the now standing woman. In a surprising move, she leaped high into the air and delivered a powerful punch that sent the fish crashing into the bagua formation. As its immense body struck the Gen position of the formation, a small mountain descended upon its head, causing the fish monster to be flung toward the Zhen position, where it was met with a crackling burst of electricity, sizzling and popping as it jumped and slid, eventually falling into the Li position, where flames erupted, creating a scene of utter devastation. 

In a sudden twist, the fish monster transformed into the shape of a little girl in black clothing, who began to run frantically while sobbing, desperately trying to wipe away her tears. She dodged fire dragons and ice spears, occasionally getting struck by bolts of lightning, convulsing in pain as she rolled her eyes.

Watching this spectacle, Chen Pingan felt a twinge of sympathy. He averted his gaze slightly, closing one eye.

Having seen many fierce and terrible spirits wreaking havoc, he noted that most were imposing upon first appearance. Take, for instance, the carriage of Fan Yunlu from Ghost Valley, or even the spirits confronting the demons of Copper Smell City, often accompanied by a band of followers bearing a large wooden plank. Yet, he had never witnessed such a pathetic scene as this one.

At the lake, those outside the fight continued drinking, cheering in delight, and the mischievous children remained close to their elders. Initially, the appearance of the giant fish leaping from the lake had been frightening, but now they showed little fear. In Baoxiang Kingdom, the most lively events were those involving the capture of demons; it was more festive than New Year's celebrations.

As the little girl, barely a foot away from the height of the bagua formation, dashed into the Xun position, a log as thick as a well's opening came crashing down. The little girl had no time to evade, and taking a deep breath, she raised her arms above her head, bracing herself against the log, her face streaked with tears and snot, choking back sobs as she cried out, "That string of bells is mine! I gave them to a passing scholar who was nearly dead! He said he needed them to get to the capital for the exam, and I told him to return them. It’s been over a hundred years, and he still hasn’t returned them! Boohoo, what a liar!"

Chen Pingan believed the girl’s outrageous claims. 

The peculiar phenomenon of Mute Lake, where the water level remained unchanged, was likely due to this little fish monster who, despite her unappealing appearance, had provided protection for merchants and travelers over the years. There had been no casualties, and whether human or demon, one could say that, no matter how grand the words, many times they did not compare to a single fact or a clear thread of truth. 

After all these years, the local people and passing merchants should have felt grateful for her protection. Whatever her initial intentions, they should acknowledge her merit, for even if capturing demons was a matter of course, Chen Pingan understood this little fish monster bore no malice; she was likely just envious of the string of bells, coupled with a mischievous spirit. He had already seen through the woman in the hooded cloak, who was undoubtedly a concealed fifth realm martial artist... or perhaps even a sixth realm from Baoxiang Kingdom. Regardless, he made no move to intervene.

However, it was somewhat unexpected that the string of bells belonged to the fish monster girl.

Once the little girl revealed the truth, the woman who had punched away the monster stood by the emerald lake, smiling as she said, “Don’t worry, we’re not here to kill you. This is the intention of the National Master of Qiangou Kingdom; they need a river goddess. You will be stationed at the waterway, and it’s not all bad. But let’s be clear, I won’t deceive you; as a creature of this lake, you’re naturally suited for the role of river goddess. Your chances of success are greater than those who become heroic spirits after death, but it’s not guaranteed. Our sect has maintained a good relationship with the Qiangou royal court for generations, and the National Master’s office has provided a substantial amount of divine currency. It would be somewhat unkind to forcibly take you from Mute Lake. I mention all this because I believe the scholar you helped all those years ago has been quite ungrateful; not only did he fail to return your bells, but he even treasures them as a family heirloom. Those bells were given to him by the National Master of Qiangou, which helped him rise through the ranks and even earn a posthumous title. If you wish to curse him, feel free to do so once you become a river goddess. For now, it’s best you surrender quietly, or you’ll only suffer more.”

The girl in black continued to brace herself against the slowly descending log. As her feet were about to touch the lake’s bagua formation, she cried out in despair, “I’m about to be turned into boiled fish! You big bad guys just love to fight and kill! I won’t go with you! I like it here; this is my home! I’m not moving anywhere to become some river goddess! I’m still little; why should I be a goddess?” 

The hooded woman sighed, signaling her eight fellow disciples to hold off on closing the formation. She coaxed the water monster girl gently, “How about we make a deal? I can help plead your case with the National Master. I won’t take the divine currency for now, but you must accompany me back to my sect. I can’t return empty-handed; my master will be displeased. There’s a river near our sect that currently has a water god in charge. You can see what it’s like to be a water god. If you find it agreeable one day, I can take you to meet the National Master. How does that sound?”

The little girl nodded slightly.

As a martial artist, the woman formed seals with her hands, reciting incantations, and surprisingly, she could manipulate spiritual energy, releasing the log hovering over the Xun position.

The little girl bounced a few times in place, her arms swaying back and forth, and then her eyes darted around.

The hooded woman laughed and added, “Don’t think about running away; both braised fish and steamed fish are on the table.” 

The little girl sniffled, her face long and downcast. “Then just kill me! If I leave here, I might as well be dead!”

The hooded woman was somewhat helpless.

The other cultivators seemed to find the situation amusing, not rushing to catch the monster.

Suddenly, from a great distance in the sky, a brilliant beam of sword light flared up, arriving in the blink of an eye, hovering above the crowd. It was a young sword cultivator clad in a light purple robe, a broken golden hairpin interwoven with lightning adorning his hair. He smiled and said, “This little demon from Mute Lake is extremely hard to catch; you all have some skill. How much? I’ll buy it.” 

The hooded woman smiled, “Are you from the Jinwu Palace, Young Master Jin?”

The young sword cultivator grinned, “That would be me.”

The woman shook her head apologetically, “This demon cannot be sold to Young Master Jin.”

The young cultivator frowned, “I’ll pay double the price. My master’s wife needs a maid.”

The woman hesitated but shook her head again, “I’m sorry, but I can’t comply. This matter was promised to the National Master’s office, and I cannot make decisions tonight.”

The mistress of the Jinwu Palace was known for her brutal temperament. Her innate item was a legendary whip made from the green bamboo of Qing Shen Mountain, and she had a penchant for whipping her maidens. The only one who had managed to survive was an old tutor, while the rest had all met a gruesome end, their bodies discarded among the thunderclouds atop the Jinwu Palace, never to be reborn. However, the Jinwu Palace was not an evil sect; they fiercely hunted demons and spirits, often targeting the most formidable of monsters. Yet, the palace lord, being a Golden Core sword cultivator, was most fearful of the wife of the Great Yue Mountain Lord, which meant that all the female cultivators and maidens within the palace dared not utter a word around the lord.

Otherwise, this transaction could have been negotiated.

The young sword cultivator raised an eyebrow. “You refuse to reason and expect me to draw my sword before you listen? You little lady from Qing Qiangfu, a sixth realm martial artist with some talismanic powers; do you believe I won’t tear your not-so-pretty face apart and then buy that little demon?” 

He added with a cold smile, “Don’t worry, I will still buy it! But from now on, I, Jin Le, will remember your Qing Qiangfu.”

The hooded woman sighed; she couldn’t let her sect bear the brunt of this. The Jinwu Palace cultivators were known for their distinct preferences and were notoriously fickle. Once they lost their temper, it would be a difficult situation to handle.

She glanced at the little girl who had been pretending to be innocent.

Just as she was about to nod in agreement, a voice rang out from nearby. A frail-looking scholar, dressed in white, had removed his hat and stood by his bamboo box, slowly rising to his feet. He smiled and said, “If this is reasoning, then I’d rather not reason from the start; strongarm buying and selling are the way to go. At the end of the day, whoever is stronger gets to call the shots; there’s no need to waste time.”

The little girl perked up, her ears twitching as she looked up in confusion. “Isn’t it wrong to take off pants to fart, especially in a windy place like Huangfeng Valley? But what’s wrong with pulling down pants to poop? What’s the problem with that?” 

The white-clad scholar smacked his forehead, as if realizing something. “Right!”

The little girl beamed, floating in midair, sitting cross-legged with her arms crossed. “Scholars really are a bit slow!”

But then, remembering the bell she had once generously given for travel, the little girl began to pout again.

All of this was just a façade; she was merely pretending! That guy had once said that his greatest interest in life was not to become an official but to write an enthralling story, and he even planned to write an extensive article about her, calling it “The Great Water Monster of Mute Lake.” She had been so enchanted by that promise that she nearly drooled, even reminding him to depict her as fierce and ominous, with considerable prowess. The scholar had readily agreed.

Now that she had finally seen the bells, where was that long-awaited story after over a hundred years? Even if it were shorter, it would suffice.

The young sword cultivator leaned forward, eyeing the white-clad scholar with a smile. “Oh, are you two performing a duet here?” 

The white-robed scholar, still dusted with dirt, clasped his hands together. “I implore you, Young Master Jin of Jinwu Palace, to take it easy.”

Just then, another beam of sword light shot through the air, hovering beside Jin Le. It was a graceful middle-aged female cultivator, adorned with a golden hairpin. She glanced at the scene unfolding at the lake and said, “Alright, this time around, during our trial under the watch of our little master uncle, we haven’t been able to slay that Huangfeng Old Ancestor. I know you’re feeling down, but our little master uncle is still waiting for you over there, and we shouldn’t keep him waiting.”

Jin Le nodded and pointed, “Qing Qiangfu, right? I’ll remember that; expect a visit from me soon.”

He then gestured toward the white-clad scholar, who had just stopped wiping the sweat off his forehead. Upon catching his gaze, the scholar immediately ceased his actions, deliberately opened his fan, and gently fanned himself. Jin Le grinned, “I know you’re a cultivator; you’re probably wearing a robe beneath that, right? Don’t pretend to be an elder with me; are you brave enough to reveal your name and sect?”

The man chuckled, “I don’t change my name or my surname; I’m Chen Haoren.”

Jin Le’s expression darkened, and he turned to the middle-aged woman beside him, saying, “Sister, I can’t let this go; just let me draw my sword, just once.”

The Jinwu Palace female cultivator gently reminded him, “Our little master uncle might be watching us.”

Jin Le snorted at the white-robed scholar. “Hurry and offer incense and pray that you won’t fall into my hands in the future.”

The two Jinwu Palace sword cultivators took off, soaring away on their swords, leaving behind two long trails of sword light.

The eight cultivators from Qing Qiangfu, now gathered around the hooded woman, sighed in relief once the sword lights vanished. However, the mention of Jin Le’s impending visit left them all with bitter smiles. The hooded woman, in particular, felt a weight on her heart. Still, they looked toward the white-clad scholar, who was now wiping his forehead, feeling grateful. If he hadn’t stepped in to divert Jin Le’s attention, their group would have faced serious trouble, and who knows what calamity could have befallen them tonight? 

Although Qing Qiangfu's power was weaker than Jinwu Palace, they were at least in the right concerning the dispute caused by the fish monster of Mute Lake, and thus they didn’t feel overly intimidated by Jinwu Palace.

The hooded woman bowed, smiling. “This young master Chen, I’m Mao Qiulu, from the Qiangfu of Taizhi Kingdom in the northeast of Baoxiang Kingdom. Thank you for your righteous words.”

The scholar replied with a smile, “I’m not being righteous; I simply wish to buy the little water monster of Mute Lake.”

The little girl in black immediately interjected, “Great Water Monster!”

Chen Pingan turned and laughed, “Why didn’t you call yourself a great water monster when you saw the Jinwu Palace sword immortal earlier?!”

The little girl’s eyes brightened as she said, “I couldn’t speak because my throat was on fire! If you can bring that Jinwu Palace sword immortal back, just watch me speak!” 

Before she could finish her sentence, a long streak of azure golden light, possibly stretching over a thousand feet, shot toward Huangfeng Valley.

Chen Pingan squinted, glancing briefly before averting his gaze. Oh, another Golden Core sword cultivator.

Was that the little master uncle the female cultivators of Jinwu Palace had mentioned?

Following that, the world returned to clarity, and the sword light slowly faded away.

The little girl quickly cradled her head, calling out, “I’m just a tiny water monster!”

The hooded woman and an elder from her sect shared a wry smile. “If that person were to confront us, we’d be in big trouble.”

The elder shook his head, chuckling softly, “This sword immortal's temperament is aloof and proud, but his actions are entirely unlike that boastful Jin Le; he's very much like a mountain dweller, unaffected by mundane matters. Each descent is solely for slaying demons and purifying his sword. He probably came to assist Jin Le and the others; after all, that Huangfeng Old Ancestor is a genuine Golden Core entity skilled in evasion, and if one isn’t careful, they could easily fall into misfortune. I believe that after this strike, the Huangfeng Old Ancestor won’t dare show its face for decades, especially not to prey on monks.”

The woman named Mao Qiulu glanced at the white-clad scholar and sighed, “Firstly, the National Master’s office is offering a high price for this demon. Secondly, now that we’ve provoked Jin Le, Young Master Chen, if you take on this hot potato, it wouldn’t be wise. Though Qing Qiangfu may not be as strong as Jinwu Palace, we have a right to this little water monster, and we shouldn’t be overly afraid of Jinwu Palace.”

Chen Pingan tucked his fan away at his waist, smiling as he replied, “It’s fine. I’ve traveled north to make money, and spending it is what it’s all for. Just name your price, Mao Xianshi. Besides, I’m like a leaf floating on the wind, a wild cultivator. If Jinwu Palace wants to get angry, they’ll have to find me first, so as long as you’re willing to sell, I can buy.”

The little girl in black huffed, “I don’t want to sell to you! I’d rather go with that sister to Qing Qiangfu and live next to a river god; maybe I can trick some food and drinks!”

Chen Pingan turned his head and asked, “Aren’t you afraid of that Jinwu Palace sword immortal’s sword light? Once Jin Le finds out your whereabouts, there’s only so long a thief can evade capture; how can you endure living in fear every day? Can you, a great water monster, handle that?”

The little girl frowned, deep in thought. The intensity of her frown indicated just how much she was struggling with the decision.

Chen Pingan turned to the eager group of Qing Qiangfu cultivators and said, “Name your price.” 

Mao Qiulu glanced at the elder, who nodded lightly.

Mao Qiulu hesitated before asking softly, “Young Master Chen, do you truly not fear the Jinwu Palace’s persistent pursuit?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “I’ll just avoid them.”

Mao Qiulu felt troubled and said, “But the National Master’s office is offering a grain of Gu Yu money for this little water monster. Normally, it wouldn’t sell for such a high price, but since it is connected to the river goddess position…”

The little girl shouted angrily, “What?! Just one grain? Isn’t it a hundred? I’m so mad! That scholar in white, hurry up and give this soft-fisted little girl one hundred grains of Gu Yu money! If you blink even once, you won’t be a hero!”

Chen Pingan, uninterested in this little water monster’s antics, produced a single grain of Gu Yu money.

Mao Qiulu was taken aback, murmuring in disbelief, “Young Master Chen is actually buying it?!”

At that moment, a gaunt old monk appeared, floating gracefully as he approached. Behind him trailed several monks of varying ages, all of whom appeared somewhat dull-witted.

Each monk wore prayer beads that glimmered gold in the twilight, catching the eye.

Once the old monk settled, he spoke gravely, “The Jinwu Palace sword immortal has departed. That Huangfeng Old Ancestor is severely injured, its frenzy rising; rather than recuperate in seclusion, it seeks to devour people. My master has already confronted it a dozen miles away and cannot hold it for long. Everyone, please follow me and leave the Huangfeng Valley at once; we must hurry.”

Chen Pingan tossed the grain of Gu Yu money to Mao Qiulu, smiling, “Once the trade is done, we can all make our escape.”

Mao Qiulu gritted her teeth, catching the grain of Gu Yu money, which was indeed genuine.

The little water monster called out in a hurry, “Don’t forget the string of bells! You should buy it with another grain of Gu Yu money!”

Chen Pingan paid her no heed.

The little girl pouted, feeling frustrated by the scholar’s reluctance to act decisively.

Mao Qiulu chuckled as she removed the string of bells from her wrist, handing them to the scholar, who had appeared to be a mere qi practitioner all along.

The elder from her sect waved his hand, and the entire lake transformed into a bagua formation, swiftly enclosing the trembling little girl within the silver talisman net, while the other Qing Qiangfu cultivators retracted their compasses.

Mao Qiulu smiled and said, “As we release the formation, Young Master Chen, please keep an eye on her; ensure she doesn’t flee into the water.”

Chen Pingan nodded with a smile, “Of course.”

The formation’s glowing light instantly dissipated.

Chen Pingan stepped forward, grabbing the little girl by the scruff of her neck and lifting her high into the air. She remained stubbornly crossed-armed, her expression unyielding.

On the hillside, the escort masters and passing merchants quickly packed their belongings, hurrying to depart under the monks’ protection.

The eight Qing Qiangfu cultivators didn’t exchange words, instead merging with the group of Baoxiang monks, evidently intending to aid in their escape.

Chen Pingan shouted, “That escort master!”

A young escort, who had ridden to the top of the slope, turned to look.

Chen Pingan, still holding the little girl, produced a flask of wine, tossing it high toward him.

The young man simply reached out and caught the flask while seated on his horse.

He grinned, putting the flask away and cupping his hands in gratitude.

It was a chance encounter, a fleeting connection.

With an affinity for drinking, no need for pleasantries, and no inquiry about names.

Mao Qiulu turned and asked, “Young Master Chen? Aren’t you coming with us?!”

Then, to her utter surprise, she heard him say, “I’ll take a different route. You have more people; the Huangfeng Old Ancestor will definitely target you first.”

Mao Qiulu was rendered speechless, turning away from him, raising her arm high, extending her thumb, and then slowly lowering it.

Yet he had the audacity to say, “We’ll meet again at Qing Qiangfu.”

Mao Qiulu, having retracted her gesture, ignored him and walked away briskly.

The little girl who was still being held upside down shook her head, gleefully saying, “Scholar, can’t you see? She has a bit of affection for you; now, she has none at all!”

Once released, she landed on her feet.

The white-clad scholar smiled and said, “You’re quite perceptive about the world, aren’t you?”

The little girl, with her hands clasped behind her back, stared at the string of bells in his hand with wide eyes.

Chen Pingan tossed the bells to her, then donned his hat again, bending to lift the large bamboo box onto his back.

The little girl stood in shock, then twirled around, finding no difference at all. She stretched her neck, her small face scrunched up in confusion, indicating that her mind was a jumbled mess. “What’s this? Are you just going to ignore me? You really don’t see me as a great water monster, do you?”

Chen Pingan pressed his palm against her forehead and replied, “Scram.”

The little girl retorted, “What’s this? What’s this?!”

Suddenly, she opened her mouth wide, her little face splitting into a grin, revealing her sharp teeth, and asked, “Are you scared?”

Chen Pingan, with the bamboo box on his back, slowly made his way up the slope, leaving behind a casual remark, “I’m terrified.”

As the commotion grew louder to the north of the slope, the little girl hesitated, tossing the string of bells into the lake. She held her chin, furrowing her brows in deep thought, watching the white-robed scholar ascend the hillside.

She snorted and turned, striding toward the emerald lake, only to stop abruptly and look back, discovering he had already reached the peak and continued walking.

The little girl scratched her head, feeling something was off.

With a leap, she plunged into the water, transforming into a fish monster, chasing after the sinking bells, swaying her tail as she swam to the lake's bottom.

On the hillside, 

The white-clad scholar walked several miles before pausing.

He removed his hat and the bamboo box.

Before him sat a blood-soaked old monk, silently reciting scriptures.

Nearby, a staff stood upright in the yellow sand, the copper rings clashing loudly.

The old monk’s blood was a faint golden hue.

As he sank into deep meditation, golden lotus flowers blossomed around him.

A yellow whirlwind swirled nearby, and within it, one could faintly see a figure in a yellow robe.

The fierce gusts of the yellow sand whirlwind continued to batter the golden lotuses, causing their petals to fall.

Despite his eyes being tightly shut, the old monk waved his sleeve, sensing that an outsider had appeared behind him. With urgency, he said, “Hurry! Grasp my staff; it will help you escape this place. Do not look back!”

The staff flew out at an angle, darting toward the white-robed scholar, hovering beside him, urging him to take hold and flee.

In his effort to divert the staff to save the scholar, the old monk had exposed a flaw, and the yellow whirlwind grew even more ferocious. The golden lotuses around him dwindled to near extinction.

Just as the old monk was about to be completely engulfed by the yellow sand and lose his golden form, a warm voice touched his ear, “Master, please continue your meditation and recite your teachings. I am fortunate to listen and am deeply grateful.” 

Then, the young man lunged forward, covering several dozen feet in an instant, simultaneously calling out, “Follow me to slay demons!”

The bamboo box opened on its own, revealing a golden demon-binding rope that surged forward like a golden dragon, following the scholar’s snowy white figure.

The binding rope dove into the yellow whirlwind, ensnaring the figure in the yellow robe.

The white-robed scholar unleashed a torrent of thunderous punches.

His strikes echoed like thunder, yet he moved with serene poise; each sweep of his sleeve could split the entire whirlwind in two.

The old monk slowly opened his eyes, a gentle smile gracing his lips as he brought his hands together in prayer. He lowered his head, murmuring not scriptures, but softly, “Mighty virtue, remain in heart and see the purity. What a pity, if only there were tea, I would offer you a seat.”

The white-robed scholar and the yellow whirlwind clashed, retreating into the distance.

The old monk gradually rose, heading toward the bamboo box to reclaim the now-silent staff. He uttered a single Buddhist chant and strode away.

That night, under the darkening sky, 

A white-robed scholar, with a box on his back and a staff in hand, walked slowly.

Attached to his ankle was a little girl in black, who clung firmly to him, so each step he took dragged her along like sticky candy.

Chen Pingan did not look down. “You’re clinging to me like this?”

The little girl, wrapped in her burdens, nodded vigorously. “The treasures from the lake bottom in my bag are worth more than just one grain of Gu Yu money! I promised to give them all to you, but you must help me find a scholar who can write a story about me, making me seem ferocious and terrifying!”

Chen Pingan sighed in resignation. “If you keep this up, I won’t be polite anymore.”

The little girl smeared her tears and snot on his leg, choking back sobs, “Please, just take me with you! You’re so powerful; you defeated the Huang Feng Old Ancestor! Following you means I’ll eat well and live well! I must find that scholar to write my story; I want to be famous, known as the Great Water Monster of Mute Lake!”

Chen Pingan halted, looking down at her. “Still not letting go?”

The little girl stubbornly clung to him, shaking her head. She rubbed her face against his pristine robe, then looked up, frowning, “I won’t let go.”

Chen Pingan raised his foot and said, “Then off you go.”

The little girl was flung toward the emerald lake, tumbling through the air as she traced a long arc.

Moments later, 

Chen Pingan turned to look back.

From a distance, he could see a little girl trailing behind him. When she noticed him glancing back, she immediately froze, raising her head to gaze at the moon.

Chen Pingan sighed, “Staying by my side might get you killed.”

The little girl trotted along, but once she spotted the white-robed scholar frowning, she stopped abruptly and muttered, “Who isn’t going to die? In the end, everyone dies. I’m not afraid of that; I just want everyone to know who I am. Once they know, dying is no big deal.”

Chen Pingan resumed his path. 

She followed closely behind, occasionally squatting down, staring blankly at the ground, tilting her head before suddenly opening her sharp-toothed mouth wide, swallowing a lizard whole.

After standing up, the girl beamed, “Delicious!”

But she suddenly realized that the scholar was looking back at her.

She immediately straightened her expression, her eyes darting as her cheeks twitched.

Chen Pingan chuckled, “Then follow along. Once we reach the Spring Dew Garden, I’ll help you find a place to settle down. But I’ll say this now: if you have second thoughts halfway and want to return to Mute Lake, you can do it on your own. I won’t help.”

She sprinted to his side, puffing out her chest, “Me? Change my mind? Haha, I’m the Great Water Monster!”

He replied with a hum, “A tiny little water monster.”

For the first time, she felt a little shy. 

This tiny embarrassment was something that should never be written into a book.

After that day, a black-clad little girl who often complained of thirst began following the white-robed scholar.

They trekked through mountains and rivers together.

The little girl found it tremendously interesting.

That scholar would sit on a wall with her, watching the guardian spirits of two neighboring households argue.

It was between two families, one worshiping the God of Wealth, where a righteous hero emerged, while the other, adorned with the God of War, boasted a scholarly beauty, known locally as a prodigy.

The scholar, who was still only known as Chen Haoren at the time, had even stuck a particularly unflattering talisman on her, and they sat on the wall watching the commotion.

Later, they witnessed the grand wedding of a mountain deity’s daughter to the son of a water god, a celebration filled with drums and gongs, yet silence pervaded the air. At that moment, the scholar had stepped aside to let them pass, but an old granny from the mountain deity’s entourage had actively handed him a red envelope of lucky money, which he had actually accepted, politely expressing his congratulations. It was embarrassing, containing only a single snowflake coin.

They had also caught sight of the legendary Huashan Mountain Lord making his rounds, clad in golden robes, riding a white horse, with a long tail trailing behind him, quite a sight to behold.

They even witnessed three beautiful women emerge from a dilapidated temple, dressed as elegant scholars, sneaking out from a seldom-visited corner. They had walked out to meet a mortal scholar, but what followed was too embarrassing to recount. When the day broke, they returned to the temple and found three colorful yet chipped statues of beautiful maidens, each missing a scarf, a hairpin, and a bracelet compared to before.

Even more amusing was the time they stumbled upon a hidden paradise deep within the forest, where several forest spirits dressed as cultured gentlemen eagerly welcomed them. However, when they asked the scholar to recite a poem on the spot, he fell silent. They were quickly ushered out, labeled as ‘commoners.’ They awkwardly retreated, and while she made faces at him, he didn’t seem mad at all.

All of these were humorous tales, but the mundane tasks of traveling day and night and cooking meals were far less exciting.

Yet sometimes, this strange man was truly peculiar.

Once, while walking along a cliffside path, he inexplicably dashed forward into the cliff, and with a series of thuds, he punched through an entire mountain. How could he claim she had water in her brain? Not to mention the second sister!

He would often wander in circles while staying at the mountain summit, walking all night, seeming both awake and asleep. Whenever she felt sleepy, she would collapse into a deep slumber, only to wake up at dawn and see him still wandering around.

At times, he could be quite unorthodox.

During one downpour at a gathering place outside the county, where scholars and poets watched the rain as if it were a waterfall, the atmosphere was high-spirited. Suddenly, he disappeared without a trace, and for some reason, the rain ceased only in that particular pavilion, leaving the scholars inside stupefied. She watched from the water, laughing heartily.

Periodically, by the stream, he would pull out a small exquisite flying sword, using it to shave his beard. One time, he turned to her and smiled. She could hardly manage a smile; that was a celestial’s flying sword!

He had even helped farmers plant rice. During that time, he had taken off his box and hat, heading to the fields to work, seemingly particularly happy.

Initially, the rural folk were frightened that this scholar would make a mess, but to their surprise, once he got started, he was as adept as they were. Afterward, the villagers had wanted to invite him to dinner, but he had just laughed and left.

Yet, none of these trivial matters were impressive enough to make her feel satisfied; following him for so long, she had yet to make a name for herself, and no one knew she was the Great Water Monster of Mute Lake. Whenever introduced, he would only mention her surname, Zhou, and that was it.

The only moment she felt a hint of admiration for him was during an incident on a large river, where a boat traveling upstream collided with a small rowboat.

In that moment, the white-robed man flew in on his sword, landing on the small boat, one hand steadying the larger vessel while the other held a wine flask to his lips.

Later, they sat together atop a tall structure in a bustling capital city, gazing down at the dazzling nightscape, the lights twinkling like a starry river.

Finally, he uttered a line that seemed a bit scholarly, “Above is a starry river, below is a starry river; the heavens and the earth are filled with silent beauty.”

Seeing him drink, she urged him to share more.

He then said, “The moonlight enters high towers; it comes and goes, filled with love and longing.”

She felt a touch of sorrow, a vague, tiny sadness that wasn’t even about missing home. On this journey, she hadn’t thought about it at all. It was just that when she turned to look at him, it seemed he was recalling some people he missed, some heart-wrenching memories, perhaps.

Who could say? She was merely a water monster, watching people come and go year after year, and she wasn’t really human.

With this thought, she too felt a pang of sadness.

He turned his head, resting the staff across his knees. With the wine flask in hand, he gently rubbed her head.

At that moment, 

She felt he might genuinely be called Chen Haoren. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 599: Senior, Let Me Take Three Punches from You

As they wandered along the way, passing through Peach Branch Kingdom (Tao Zhi Guo) without visiting Qingqiang Mansion (Qingqiang Fu), the girl in black felt a bit unhappy. However, as they circled around the legendary Jinwu Palace (Golden Crow Palace), where sword lights were said to flicker continuously, her mood brightened once more.

The girl’s emotions resembled the clouds drifting across the sky.

On this day at a small immortal’s ferry bustling with new experiences, they finally boarded a cloud-sailing ferry, bound for Spring Dew Garden (Chun Lu Pu)! The journey was smooth, but it was exhausting nonetheless.

The girl in black stood inside a large bamboo box, her eyes wide open as she almost strained them from staring. Unfortunately, due to a prior agreement, she had to remain silent inside the box when they arrived at the crowded area of cultivators. Inside the large bamboo box, there was little aside from a broken sword that he had never drawn from its sheath. She kicked it a few times in secret, but each time she bent down to pull it out for a look, he would admonish her against doing so, even scaring her by saying that the sword had tolerated her for long enough, and if she pushed her luck any further, he wouldn’t hold back.

That left her feeling quite stifled for a while. At this moment, she raised a hand, hesitated for a while, then threw a chestnut at the back of his head. Afterward, she pretended to doze off, leaning against the bamboo box and snoring loudly. The scholar initially didn’t pay her any mind, busy bargaining with the shopkeeper to buy a set of rubbings of ancient inscriptions. Later, finding it amusing, the girl rolled up her sleeves and began banging the chestnuts rhythmically. After the scholar emerged from the shop, having spent ten snowflake coins on that set of thirty-two rubbings, he didn’t turn around but asked, "Are you done yet?"

The girl in black froze with one arm raised in the air, then gently patted the scholar’s shoulder. "Alright, now you look like an unblemished scholar. Seriously, Chen, I’m not saying this just to tease you, but you really are as dense as a block of wood. You stopped that boat on the river, and how many noble ladies were on board? Did you not notice how they were looking at you like they were about to devour you? Why didn’t you just board the ship and enjoy some tea with them? They’re not really going to eat you."

Chen Ping’an instead shifted the topic, saying, "You hit me sixteen times, and I’ll keep a record. That’s one snowflake coin per hit."

The girl crossed her arms, standing on her tiptoes inside the box, and scoffed, "That’s nothing, just a few small coins!"

Chen Ping’an then took her along onto the ferry.

Carrying a little spirit of mischief like her was somewhat eye-catching.

However, most of the gazes were dismissive or mocking. Out here, among cultivators, being able to ride a mountain lord or a flood dragon across mountains and rivers was the mark of a true hero, a genuine immortal.

Chen Ping’an felt quite good about it.

During the Grain Rain season, it often rained at night while remaining sunny during the day. The gentle rains nourished a hundred grains, bringing clarity and purity to the world, making it suitable for leisurely walking and enjoying the scenic views along the way.

However, Chen Ping’an still hoped to catch the tail end of the gathering at Spring Dew Garden. As a steward, he couldn’t afford to be idle all the time.

The girl in black was still reluctant. "We could at least have had some tea on the boat! I saw two elegant ladies on the shore when we were docked, dressed so beautifully, it was a golden opportunity!"

Chen Ping’an chuckled softly, "If you were a man, I bet after spending too long at Dumb Lake (Ya Ba Hu), you would eventually develop lustful thoughts and cause trouble. If I caught you at that time, you’d be taken by Qingqiang Mansion to be a river witch, or abducted by Jinwu Palace to be a maid. I wouldn’t intervene; I’d just stand by and applaud."

The girl in black punched the guy who had no filter on the shoulder, fuming. "Nonsense! I’m a big water monster, but I’ve never harmed anyone! I wouldn't even scare anyone!"

Chen Ping’an shrugged it off, "That’s another snowflake coin for you."

The girl was about to punch him again, but he said, "If you strike me on the head, that’s one small summer coin."

She weighed her remaining coins, realizing she didn’t have many left after deducting the grain rain coin that she had used to redeem herself.

No wonder those martial artists passing by Dumb Lake often lamented that money was the hero’s courage.

Frowning, she thought for a moment, "Chen, can you lend me a grain rain coin? I’m a bit short right now and can’t hit you that many times."

Chen Ping’an simply ignored her and asked, "Do you know why I wanted to buy a jar of pickled vegetables back in that county?"

The girl was puzzled. "How would I know what you were thinking? Did you finish the pickles we brought on this trip? I hardly had any; you’re so stingy, only taking a tiny pinch every time while glaring at me."

Chen Ping’an smiled, "I heard that pickled fish is delicious."

The girl felt quite clever as she understood immediately. She blinked back tears, crouched inside the bamboo box, and silently wiped her eyes. She was both clever and unfortunate.

However, upon reaching the bottom deck of the ferry, after he set down the bamboo box, she leaped out in one bound, hands on her hips, a look of disdain on her face. "So shabby!"

Chen Ping’an took off his hat. There was tea on the table, rumored to be the local specialty, Rounding Village Tea, available nowhere else. After pouring a cup and tasting it, he found it sweet and refreshing, though the spiritual energy was almost non-existent. It was said that before the ferry was built, a retired official hermit wanted to create a summer retreat, cutting bamboo and discovering a small pond where the morning glow shone like gauze, making the water incredibly clear—perfect for brewing tea first and then brewing wine. Later, many came to visit, including cultivators who often exchanged poetry with literary masters, and they discovered the pond was filled with spiritual energy, though it was all confined to the hills nearby. Thus, a ferry for immortals came into being, quite far from the master’s sect.

Chen Ping’an began practicing his stance while the girl in black sat on a chair, swinging her legs, muttering, "I want to eat that turtle jelly from the corner shop by the ferry. It’s cold and bitter. I could only stand in the bamboo box then, swaying and dizzy, unable to truly taste it. It’s all your fault for wandering around, looking here and there. We haven’t bought much, but we’ve walked a lot. Hurry up and buy me a serving of turtle jelly."

Chen Ping’an pretended not to hear her.

The girl was just feeling bored and chatting casually.

However, when the scholar started wandering around again, she knew she could only continue to be bored alone.

She jumped down from the chair, dragging herself to the window, standing up with her arms crossed. The ferry had two levels, and since that guy was stingy and unwilling to stay on the upper floor with a better view, the room often had people walking along the deck outside. There were also a few people lingering by the railing, which made her feel annoyed. With so many people around, not a single one recognized her as the water monster from Dumb Lake.

As the ferry slowly ascended, she swayed with excitement and turned to him, saying, "We’re flying! Look, the shops by the ferry are getting smaller! Like grains of rice!"

This was her first time riding an immortal ferry, and she was still unsure if the clouds in the sky were edible. After spending so many years at the bottom of Dumb Lake, she had often wondered.

He merely walked back and forth in the room.

There were quite a few people by the ferry’s railing, chatting about many recent interesting occurrences. The girl perked up, especially when the topics turned to Baoxiang Kingdom (Baoxiang Guo) and Huangfeng Valley (Huangfeng Gu). She pricked up her ears, not wanting to miss a word.

Someone mentioned that the old ancestor in the yellow robe from Huangfeng Valley had died, not by the sword of Jinwu Palace's master’s junior uncle, but it seemed he had been severely injured and later subdued by a passing virtuous monk from Baoxiang Kingdom. However, for some reason, the old monk did not acknowledge this and revealed no further details.

The girl shook her head angrily, scratching her head. If it weren’t for Chen, the scholar, telling her not to speak carelessly to outsiders, she would have wanted to shout out loud that the yellow-robed ancestor was killed by them!

Feeling wronged, she turned her head and lowered her voice, "I can reveal my true form and cut off a few pounds of meat for you to make boiled fish. Then can I talk to those people? I won’t say you killed the yellow-robed ancestor, just that I’m the water monster from Dumb Lake and witnessed that grand battle."

The man, however, remained unsympathetic. "What’s the rush? In the future, when someone finishes writing a strange tale or a travelog, and it gets published, everyone will naturally know. You could claim you punched the yellow-robed ancestor to death for all I care."

The girl thought for a moment, still looking resentful, but it seemed he had a point.

Fortunately, he showed a bit of conscience. "The first-floor room on the ferry doesn’t come with mountain news reports. Go buy one if you can. If there are any left unsold, you can get them, but if it’s too expensive, then forget it."

The girl responded with an "Oh," but as long as she could walk a few more steps outside the ferry, it wouldn’t be a loss. She jumped down from the chair, unfastened her bag, and pulled out a brilliantly colorful bag filled with treasures—she had saved these up over the years. Then she casually placed the bag back in her pack, leaving it on the table. As she was leaving, she reminded him, "When wandering the Jianghu, be prudent. Don’t let thieves steal our belongings, or you’ll be left to drink the northwest wind!"

Chen Ping’an chuckled, "Wow, you’re feeling generous today, willing to spend your own money."

As she reached the doorway, the girl raised an eyebrow and turned back, "If you keep talking around me like that, we’ll split the cost of the news report!"

He immediately fell silent.

The girl sighed, sounding mature. "With how you travel the Jianghu, how can those mountain fairies ever like you?"

Chen Ping’an continued his stance practice, smiling, "The old rules: No nonsense. Buy the news report, and come right back."

About a stick of incense later, the girl pushed the door open and swaggered back, slamming a stack of news reports onto the table. Then, when the man had his back turned, she quickly showed her teeth and made faces, swallowing hard. When he turned back, she immediately crossed her arms and sat upright in the chair.

Chen Ping’an paused his stance, took out his folding fan, and glanced at her. "Did you spend too much?"

She scoffed, "Do you think I’m that stupid? This many precious mountain news reports were originally two small summer coins, but I only spent one! I’m the water monster from Dumb Lake; I’ve seen my fair share of merchants. I can haggle until they bleed!"

Chen Ping’an felt a bit helpless as he sifted through the news reports, some of which were even from the previous year. At regular market prices, the total should indeed be one small summer coin, but news reports, like seasonal vegetables, often became worthless after a while. So many reports looked like a lot, but together they were hardly worth half a small summer coin. These were just business matters, and as long as both parties agreed, there was no such thing as a deal where only one side profits. However, in some cases, if it wasn’t a transaction, then it shouldn’t be so easy to bargain.

This girl was really something.

She was indeed a bit simple-minded, but there was something about her that was priceless. Just like the young courier with cracked, bleeding lips, offering a water pouch while riding on horseback; even if Chen Ping’an didn’t take it, he would still be thirsty.

The girl had been bullied outside; she seemed to think that was just an external matter. Before she entered the house, she had crouched in the corridor for a long time to recover, and then walked into the room without thinking that beside her was a familiar sword immortal, who would definitely have some expectations.

She probably felt that this was her Jianghu? The stories she had accumulated in the Jianghu, some had to be written down, while some embarrassing little anecdotes could be left out.

Chen Ping’an leaned back in his chair, holding the folding fan, gently stirring a breeze. "If you’re in pain, just shout a little. I’m not the kind of scholar who writes your story, so what’s there to fear?"

The girl in black morphed into a pitiful expression, her face wet with tears, but she quickly turned away, swallowing a mouthful of fresh blood.

Chen Ping’an smiled and asked, "What happened exactly?"

The girl raised her hands, hurriedly wiping her face and bowing her head, silent.

Chen Ping’an smiled, "What’s the matter? Are you worried that today, after finally having the chance to leave the bamboo box and go out for a short adventure, you ended up causing trouble, and now you’ll never get the chance again?"

In truth, after traveling through so many mountains and rivers together, she had never caused any trouble at all.

She merely widened her eyes, filled with curiosity and anticipation for this vast world outside of Huangfeng Valley and Dumb Lake.

The girl in black nodded gently, looking a bit sickly.

Chen Ping’an closed his fan, smiling, "Come on, tell me. After all the times you’ve laughed at me on this journey, it’s only fair that you let me have a good laugh too, right? It’s called reciprocity."

The girl leaned on the table, resting her head sideways, stretching out a finger to lightly trace the surface. There were no grudges or anger—just a tiny worry the size of a grain of rice. She softly said, "I don’t want to talk. It’s not a big deal. I’ve seen many big water monsters live and die. I’ve seen many people die near Dumb Lake, and I was too scared to save them. The yellow-robed ancestor was very powerful. If I went out and couldn’t save anyone, I’d die too. All I could do was secretly gather some corpses. Some were taken away crying, while others were left to the winds and sands, so pitiful. It’s not that I’m afraid of death; I just fear being forgotten. With so many people in the world, not a single one knows about me."

Chen Ping’an leaned forward, lightly tapping her on the head with the fan. "If you don’t speak, I’ll pretend I didn’t hear you."

The girl straightened up, letting out a sound, shaking her head, swaying left and right, and happily laughed, "Then I won’t say it!"

Then she noticed the scholar tilting his head, holding the fan against his forehead, smiling at her, "Do you know that many times, many people, when their parents don’t teach them, and their teachers don’t teach them, they should let the world teach them how to behave?"

The girl began to frown, her little face scrunching up. She didn’t quite understand what he was saying but felt it would be bad if he knew that she didn’t understand, so she pretended she did. Pretending was a bit tough, just like that time when they accidentally entered a land of peach blossoms, and he had asked those mountain spirits in scholar robes to recite a poem; he had completely been at a loss.

He stood up without moving much, the talisman flew out from the window into his sleeve, and the window opened by itself.

Standing by the window, the ferry was now in the sea of clouds, a gentle breeze brushing against them, his two snow-white sleeves fluttering gracefully. She felt a bit annoyed; being taller was great, wasn’t it!

After hesitating, standing on her chair, she suddenly realized that encountering some danger while wandering the Jianghu only made her more knowledgeable.

She immediately brightened up, hands behind her back, strutting around the small space on the chair, smiling, "After I bought the news report, the ferry man selling it laughed loudly with his friend beside him. I didn’t know what they were laughing about, so I turned my head and smiled back at them. Didn’t you say before that no matter whether you’re in the mountains or valleys, whether you’re human or monster, you should treat others politely? Then that ferry man’s friend, who was just about to leave the room, accidentally bumped into me at the door. I couldn’t stand firm, and the news reports scattered all over the place. I said it was okay and went to pick them up, but that person stepped on my foot and even twisted it hard, which didn’t seem like an accident. I couldn’t hold back then and frowned, but I ended up kicking him away. However, the ferry man said that he was a guest, so that fierce guy didn’t bother with me. I just picked up the reports and ran back here."

She crossed her arms, looking serious, "I’m not exaggerating; I was really in pain and just grimaced a little!"

She feared that he wouldn’t believe her and raised two fingers, "Only this much at most!"

He turned his head, smiling as he asked, "You said that with good intentions, isn’t it right to split it into two—be kind to the good and be harsh to the wicked? But if you’ve sorted out the order and scale of punishments for the wicked, and if the punishments don’t match the order, does that mean you’ve gone against it yourself? When good and evil collide, the outcome is that evil breeds evil. Little by little, it accumulates like soil building into a mountain, leading to stormy weather. But what can be done about that?"

The girl scrunched her face, silently telling herself that she understood but was too lazy to speak, feeling weak and hungry.

He smiled gently, lightly tapping his heart with the fan, "You don’t need to think too much; I’m just asking my own heart."

The girl in black didn’t want him to be like this, so she felt a bit guilty.

Unlike others who were shrouded in mystery and difficult to discern, she preferred the version of him who worked in the fields and opened mountains with his fists.

Fortunately, he suddenly smiled and jumped out of the window, landing on the deck outside. "Let’s go enjoy the scenery. Not only are there dark clouds, but also magnificent mountains and rivers."

He leaned on the window, extending a hand, teasing, "I’ll lift you out."

The girl angrily replied, "Get lost! I can do it myself!"

She leaped out of the window but, still having been bitten by a snake once, was wary of the rope. So, she hesitantly grabbed his sleeve, feeling that standing in the bamboo box was quite good.

She turned to glance at the open window and softly said, "We may be poor, but at least we’re not worried about food and clothing. If we get robbed, it would only add to our troubles. I don’t want to eat pickled fish, and you shouldn’t either."

However, he replied, "That depends on whether they have the life to keep their stolen goods."

She blinked her eyes, nodding vigorously. "That’s awesome!"

As a result, he tapped her head with the fan, "Don’t learn bad things."

She hugged her head and stepped on his foot.

He laughed, "This is good."

In the end, she was still too afraid to step on the railing and was instead held up by him and placed on the railing.

As she walked along, she felt a sense of pride.

Many people were watching her.

She looked down to see that the man was casually walking below, one hand swinging the fan while the other held her hand up high.

She then insisted she didn’t need him to protect her and could walk steadily on her own!

At that moment, the ferry saw many cultivators and pure martial artists witness this strange scene.

A girl dressed in plain yet rare robes smiled and asked, "Is that little fish monster at the door cultivating in the cave realm?"

Beside her, a handsome young cultivator nodded, "If I’m not mistaken, she’s right at the cave realm but hasn’t mastered flying yet. If it weren’t for the ferry’s formation protecting her, if she fell off the boat, it would be fine if the ground below was a river or lake, but if it was the mountains, she would be dead for sure."

The man chuckled softly, "Young Master Wei, this unknown little water monster just bought a news report from the ferry manager and spent a fortune, wasting a whole small summer coin."

The handsome young man, referred to as Young Master Wei, pretended to be surprised. "Such extravagance?"

The young female cultivator giggled, glancing at the young man beside her, her eyes filled with affection. 

The others laughed in agreement, as if they had heard a profound saying.

Helpers are not just observers; they help turn individual joys into collective ones.

The young female cultivator then asked, "Young Master Wei, that scholar in white, doesn’t he seem like the master of that little dirty thing? Why does he look more like a rough martial artist than a Qi cultivator in the fifth realm?"

Wei Bai laughed, turning to the girl, "You can’t say that in front of my father; it would embarrass him. He’s currently the most prominent martial artist in our Great View Dynasty."

The young female cultivator quickly smiled apologetically. "I misspoke."

Wei Bai sighed in resignation. "You’re being too polite, does that make me feel like you’re distancing yourself from me?"

The girl named Qingqing smiled brightly.

She came from the Nightwatch Pavilion of Spring Dew Garden, and her father was one of the patrons there, running half a mountain range himself. For those who were highly regarded, even among the secular royalty and noble families, descending from the mountains meant being a guest at the luxurious residences or among the immortals. This time she came down specifically to invite this noble son to the Spring Dew Garden for the finale of the Spring Farewell Feast.

Southeast of the coastline was the Great View Dynasty, which had three countries as its protective barrier. The noble son from the Iron Ship Mansion was one of the three most powerful families in the dynasty. For generations, they had been officials in the capital, but now the head of the Wei family, Wei Ying, abandoned his pen for military service in his youth, creating a new path for the family. Now he held military power as the strongest bulwark at the border while his eldest son served as an official in the court, already a Deputy Minister. As the youngest son of General Wei, Wei Bai was spoiled since he was young and was a renowned young genius in the dynasty, even earning praise from the old ancestor of the Spring Dew Garden who rarely left his mountain. It was said that when the ancestor passed by the Wei family, he smiled and said, "Seeing you two today, when outsiders mention Wei Bai, it’s still as General Wei Ying’s son. But in less than thirty years, outsiders will only refer to Wei Ying as Wei Bai's father."

General Wei Ying roared with laughter, enjoying it immensely, given that the ancestor of the Spring Dew Garden didn’t easily praise others.

Wei Bai received direct praise from the old ancestor, confirming his talent in cultivation, which drew countless envious stares from the court and commoners alike. Even the emperor bestowed him a decree and a precious treasure from the imperial treasury, hoping Wei Bai would continue to work hard and become a pillar of the nation early on.

In truth, she and Wei Bai weren't a perfect match.

When they first met, the Iron Ship Mansion intended to bring them together, and General Wei Ying had told her in front of her that they were a match made in heaven. However, at that time, the old ancestor of the Spring Dew Garden hadn’t yet descended to the Great View Dynasty, so her father was somewhat reluctant, thinking that a Wei Bai who had yet to enter the cave realm had an uncertain future. After all, becoming a Qi cultivator was just the first threshold to the cave realm.

As time passed, with Wei Bai’s smooth sailing in cultivation, he was young and on the verge of breaking through the cave realm barrier, gaining the old ancestor’s favor from the Spring Dew Garden. The Iron Ship Mansion began to pull back, resulting in this trip of hers down the mountain. In truth, she didn’t need her father to urge her; she was eager herself.

She didn’t bring any attendants. Although the Spring Dew Garden wasn’t the most powerful, it had extensive connections, and everyone would give the cultivators of the Spring Dew Garden some respect.

For instance, the junior uncle of Jinwu Palace would often go alone with a sword to the secluded mountains of Spring Dew Garden to fetch water and brew tea.

However, Wei Bai had two attendants with him, one a taciturn cultivator from Iron Ship Mansion who was said to have once been a demonic cultivator and had taken refuge in the mansion for decades, and another a seventh realm martial artist whose presence could influence the martial fortunes of a small vassal kingdom!

Wei Bai turned to look at a robust old man standing behind the group, asking, "Master Liao, can you tell anything about that scholar in white?"

The old man, who had been resting with his eyes closed, opened his eyes and smiled upon hearing the question. "From his breathing and footsteps, he should be at least equivalent to a martial artist in the fifth realm at the border of our Great View Dynasty, slightly stronger than the usual fifth realm Jianghu weaklings."

Beside the robust old man stood a shriveled old woman with a fierce expression, her voice hoarse. "Young Master, what Liao said is about right."

The old man snorted coldly.

Given the age difference between them, calling her "youngster" wasn’t overstepping, but she, as a Qi cultivator, had never shown him any respect.

The man from a prominent Jianghu sect in the Great View Dynasty rubbed his hands together and smiled. "Young Master Wei, why not go down and test that young martial artist? It’ll be a fun show to entertain everyone. Besides, it’ll give me a chance to learn something from Master Liao’s fist techniques."

His sect was a dominant force in the southern Jianghu, with a mix of thousands of followers who controlled many financial interests related to transport and salt, all thanks to the Iron Ship Mansion’s backing. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have had the means or guts to do so. Their sect also had a martial arts grandmaster at the gold body realm, but privately, he had mentioned that he often lost more than he won against that Liao character.

Hearing the man’s eager words, Wei Bai shook his head with a laugh. "I think we should skip it. You Jianghu martial artists are not like our Iron Ship Mansion soldiers, who are all about face. That young martial artist probably thinks he finally got a chance that should belong to a cultivator, letting that little water monster recognize him as its master. So, on this trip, even though he boarded an immortal ferry, he still can’t shake off his Jianghu temperament and loves to show off. Once we reach Spring Dew Garden, where fish and dragons mix, if he continues like this, he will face hardship."

The man looked at him with admiration. "Young Master Wei has a heart of a bodhisattva and the demeanor of an immortal."

Wei Bai shook his head with a smile. "What kind of immortal am I? Let’s talk about it later."

Suddenly, he turned and said, "However, you, Ding Tong, as someone from the Jianghu, not a cultivator, can only live longer if you do. The kind of remarks similar to that elusive Master Peng will only come if you live long enough."

The old woman standing beside the robust old man mocked, "That Peng fellow deserves to be elusive; if he were to face Liao, he’d be stomped flat. If he’s a martial artist at the eighth realm, with the backing of a sect, why wouldn’t the mountain folk step on him?"

The robust old man coldly scoffed, "Would you dare say that to old Peng’s face?"

The old woman replied, "I wouldn’t just say it to his face; if he stood before me, I would point at his nose and say it."

The gold body elder grew weary of arguing with an old woman and resumed resting with his eyes closed.

The man of martial artist status chuckled, not feeling awkward at all. After all, it wasn’t him being talked about. Even if it were, how could he earn a few words from an elder of the Iron Ship Mansion? That would be a great honor, and when he returned to his sect, it would be quite a topic of conversation.

Wei Bai leaned against the railing, sighing. "I heard that the Northern Sect Master He recently traveled south. Not only is Master He exceptionally talented, having entered the upper fifth realm at such a young age, but she also has a continuous source of blessings. As a cultivator from a small place like Baoping, she managed to find a small cave, subduing many great demons and ghosts in a short time, establishing a sect head in such a short time. With her mountain guardian formation and small cave, she successfully repelled two jade purity realm cultivators. Truly admirable! When I travel north, I must visit her, even if it's just to catch a distant glimpse."

The young female cultivator from the Nightwatch Pavilion felt a bit gloomy.

However, it was quickly dispelled.

Because Wei Bai himself was well aware that he was merely hoping for a distant glance at that high-and-mighty Master He.

Suddenly, Wei Bai leaned closer to the young woman, whispering, "Qingqing, the moon in the sky is the moon in the sky, and the person before me is the person before me. I understand my own heart."

The young female cultivator’s frown instantly relaxed, her smile returning.

Back at the ferry’s railing, that oblivious little dirty monster was still happily prancing about.

As for the young man in white, who had a bit of dirt on his robe, he still stood there, feigning elegance while swinging his folding fan.

Suddenly, one of the spectators could no longer bear the sight and chose to take action.

Wei Bai furrowed his brow.

A streak of spiritual energy condensed into a hidden arrow aimed at the girl in black’s leg. It would shatter her kneecap while penetrating the ferry’s weak protective formation. To outsiders, it would appear as if the little girl had simply lost her balance and fallen from the ferry, accidentally resulting in her death. The ferry wouldn’t be held accountable; after all, she had fallen from the railing on her own—it wasn’t their fault.

Unfortunately, the concealed spiritual energy arrow was blocked by the scholar, who used his fan to deflect it. However, it was evident that he didn’t come away unscathed, swiftly retreating two steps and leaning against the railing to stabilize himself.

Wei Bai shook his head.

It turned out he really was useless.

Fortunately, he hadn’t let his sycophant take action earlier. If that had gotten out, it would have been embarrassing for both him and the Iron Ship Mansion. This trip to Spring Dew Garden was bound to be troublesome.

The white-clad scholar’s face turned serious as he shouted, "Is there no one to manage this ferry? Someone is attacking on the second floor!"

The girl in black quickly jumped down from the railing, hiding beside him, her face pale. She hadn’t forgotten his earlier warning as she asked through her heart’s ripples, "Is he stronger than the yellow-robed ancestor?"

The scholar didn’t reply with words but nodded lightly and whispered, "Much stronger."

Seeing this, the girl became anxious. "Then should we run quickly?"

The scholar suddenly changed his expression, gently placing a hand on her head, closing the fan with a smile. "If we run today, will we let these troublemakers go tomorrow to harm others? The world is a pot of porridge; those flies in the soup should be hooked and thrown out. Remember those people we encountered in the Jianghu? Do you recall what I said afterward?"

The girl thought for a moment and nodded, "You said that when disaster strikes, everyone seems like a weakling. Before that, everyone seems strong since there are always weaker weaklings around."

Earlier, as they ascended the mountain slowly, the local villagers mentioned that something strange had been happening on that mountain, so they were curious to check it out.

On a secluded mountain path, they encountered a group of Jianghu heroes drinking on horseback, full of bravado, claiming they would slay a monster to gain fame. 

For some reason, the white-clad scholar hadn’t stepped aside while walking in the middle of the road and was directly knocked away by a tall horse, the mounted people laughing boisterously as they rode away.

Yet at that time, she hadn’t worried.

After all, he was a sword immortal capable of killing the yellow-robed ancestor. 

Moreover, he hadn’t even used the flying sword he kept in his wine flask.

But she felt angry.

She couldn’t help but open her mouth, only to find that the white-clad scholar was already beside her, gently pressing her head down, laughing as he said it was alright.

Then they both witnessed that group of Jianghu warriors being blocked by a towering monster that was two yards tall, which at that moment was chomping on an arm, holding a bloodied corpse in its hand.

The girl in black realized that the dead person was the same one who had carelessly knocked the scholar away.

In the end, she hid behind the white-clad scholar as he extended the closed fan, pointing at the ferocious, man-eating monster, laughing, "You should finish your meal first before talking."

That monster actually dropped the corpse from its hands and tried to escape into the dense forest.

Those Jianghu warriors, who had initially been eager to slay the monster, fell to their knees, begging for mercy.

The girl didn’t like this Jianghu story at all. 

From beginning to end, she had disliked it.

On the second floor of the ferry, in a viewing platform, there were also crowds gathering.

Watching as the white-clad scholar blocked that attack, they lost interest.

Let the two of them deal with it.

The white-clad scholar didn’t dare to make a fuss either, seemingly pretending that nothing had happened.

The crowd at the viewing platform erupted in laughter.

Without hesitation, they revealed to the two who had attacked.

A ferry attendant, steeling himself, approached the white-clad scholar. He wasn’t worried that the ferry passenger would nag but feared being forced by the manager to annoy the esteemed guests on the second floor, which would ruin any chance of getting a reward during this trip to Spring Dew Garden.

The young attendant stood before the white-clad scholar with a stern face, asking, "What are you shouting about? Where did you see someone attacking?"

The white-clad scholar turned to the girl in black. "Was it the news report he sold you? Did he also advise the other guest not to kill you, acting like a good person?"

She shook her head.

It was a much older man.

The white-clad scholar lightly tapped his chest with the fan, talking to himself, "Cultivators should cultivate their hearts more; otherwise, if they walk with a limp, they won’t reach the highest point."

The girl in black tugged at his sleeve, covering her mouth with one hand and tilting her head to whisper, "Don’t be angry; otherwise, I’ll get angry at you! I’m fierce!"

The scholar looked up at the second floor. "No, I want to reason with them. I didn’t get to say enough at Cangjun Lake last time."

The young attendant reached out, ready to shove the white-clad scholar aside, annoyed at his pretentiousness. "Aren’t you going to settle down? Why don’t you go back and cool off?"

Then he froze in shock.

His palm couldn’t reach any further than an inch from the man.

The white-clad scholar smiled, "You think pressing down on the fourth realm makes me just a fourth realm martial artist?"

The young attendant suddenly bent forward, cupping his hands with a smile. "Please continue enjoying the scenery, honored guest; I won’t disturb you."

Without another word, he turned and ran.

He actually managed to escape.

When he reached the bow and turned to look back, the white-clad scholar had already disappeared, leaving only a girl in black with a worried expression.

On the second floor of the ferry, not far from Wei Bai, the viewing platform was now empty.

Seven or eight male and female cultivators who traveled together took a step back.

Their eyes widened, as the scholar who had barely blocked the spiritual energy arrow now stood on the railing, one hand behind his back, lightly swinging the fan, looking down at them.

When someone was about to speak, their spiritual energy suddenly stagnated, as if weighed down by a mountain, turning their face red and leaving them speechless.

The white-clad scholar smiled and said, "When I reason with you, just listen."

With a snap, he closed the fan and lightly lifted it.

The cultivator who had shot the hidden arrow was suddenly lifted off the ground, his head held by the white-clad scholar, and with a simple toss, he was thrown out of the ferry.

With another flick of the fan, another person was seized by the neck, lifted high, and sent flying overboard.

All of them were knocked out of the ferry like dumplings.

The viewing platform was now completely empty, leaving only the white-clad scholar, who was casually leaning against the railing with a red wine pot hanging from his waist.

He leaned back slightly, suddenly flying out of the ferry, his two snow-white sleeves fluttering loudly as he descended, disappearing from sight.

Moments later, he reappeared on the ferry’s railing, looking up at the viewing platform of Room No. 1, smiling but saying nothing.

Wei Bai pulled at the corner of his mouth, "Master Liao, what do you think?"

The robust old man stepped forward, dispersing those who only knew how to boast and flatter from the mountains. He stared at the white-clad scholar and said in a deep voice, "It’s hard to say."

Wei Bai glanced at the Jianghu man whose complexion was slightly pale, then turned back to Wei Bai, smiling, "Doesn’t that make things a bit troublesome?"

The old woman stood next to Wei Bai. "What’s so troublesome about it? Just let Liao go down and play with him for a while; we’ll see how much weight he has."

Wei Bai didn’t take the lead, as the servants and attendants were still human, especially those with real prowess. He was always generous with his closeness and respect. So, Wei Bai said softly, "Master Liao, you don’t need to take the lead."

The robust old man clenched his fist, his joints popping like firecrackers, and coldly laughed, "Those flowery pillows in the south can’t stand a blow, while the swordmaster in the north is protected by the state. Since we’ve finally encountered someone who dares to provoke the Iron Ship Mansion, it doesn’t matter if he’s a martial artist or a cultivator. I won’t miss this opportunity today."

The gold body elder from the Iron Ship Mansion didn’t show great momentum, instead, he pressed a hand against the railing and lightly floated down to the first floor deck, smiling, "Kid, want to keep me warm? Don’t worry, I won’t kill you; we have no grudges."

The man raised his head, resting his finger on the fan against his chin, seemingly deep in thought. Then he put away the fan and floated down, "Getting hit just once isn’t a good outcome…"

The white-clad scholar paused for a moment, then with a bright smile said, "Then let’s do three punches."

He placed one hand behind his back, holding the fan, and pointed to his forehead. "You can throw three punches first; then we’ll talk. Life and death are your own responsibility, how about that?"

The two of them stood on opposite sides of the ferry, about twenty steps apart.

All the passengers on the ferry were whispering among themselves.

Those on Wei Bai’s side found it utterly bizarre.

Only one passenger from the farther southern Baoxiang Kingdom, fleeing towards the Spring Dew Garden, turned pale, trembling lips.

He wanted to cry without tears.

How did I end up encountering this unpredictable and profound young sword immortal again? 

Young sword immortal, I’m just trying to escape here! I didn’t intend to board the same ferry as you! 

The gold body elder, surnamed Liao, scoffed, "Kid, you’re really going to let me hit you three times?"

The white-clad scholar looked genuinely astonished. "Is that not enough? Then let’s do four punches. If you feel uncertain, then five punches, but it really can’t be more than that. If it’s too much, the spectators will find it dull."

The elder gave a thumbs up and laughed, "After three punches, I hope you still have a complete corpse."

He didn’t say more; his fist stance opened up, and the surge of spiritual energy erupted, the intent behind the fist rising violently.

The atmosphere on both floors was filled with an intense wind.

Some cultivators and martial artists of lower cultivation could hardly keep their eyes open.

With a loud bang, the walls and windows on the side of the room began to crack incessantly.

The robust old man now stood in the spot where the white-clad scholar had previously stood. Upon looking again, he found that the scholar had instantly shattered and scattered. Instead, he now stood at the bow of the ferry, his white robe and sleeves billowing like snow.

This made some of those who recognized the elder from the Iron Ship Mansion hold back their cheers.

The man’s throat tightened; it seemed he wasn’t as relaxed as he appeared. He probably forced down a mouthful of blood that surged to his lips, but he still smiled at the elder. "With that punch, if it were anyone else, they would have died on the spot, but old senior, you still have kindness in your heart, showing mercy."

The elder narrowed his eyes; the white-robed man’s robe was now dusted off by his punch, but there wasn’t a single tear in it. The elder said in a deep voice, "A high-quality magical robe, no wonder, no wonder! Good strategies, deep schemes, well-hidden!"

The man still held the fan, slowly walking forward. "I’ve worked hard to buy this robe by selling my kitchenware. Are you blaming me for not being killed by your punch? If you keep this up, you’re not following the Jianghu code. Fine, I’ll just remove the robe’s effect, and there are still two punches left."

The elder stepped down, causing the entire ferry to drop over a foot, his figure lunging forward like thunder, delivering a punch that embodied the pinnacle of his fist intent.

This time, the white-clad scholar should either explode into pieces or at least be punched through the ferry and fall to the ground, right?

No.

Not only that.

The man still stood in place, still holding the fan, but he merely raised his previously behind-his-back hand.

This time, it was the robust elder who was sent sliding back, standing still afterward, shoulders slightly slumped.

On the second floor, Wei Bai’s expression darkened.

The old woman’s face turned ashen, her thoughts wavering.

The white-clad scholar remained motionless for a moment, then exclaimed, "Ah, I didn’t move! Old senior, your fist techniques are divine; I’m terrified. Fortunately, you only have one punch left. I’m feeling apprehensive now, but thankfully, old senior is polite and didn’t agree to five punches in one go. I’m quite frightened now."

All the passengers on the ferry were on the brink of collapse.

Damn, I’ve never seen someone so skilled at acting and yet so careless!

The robust elder chuckled. "Then let’s have the final punch!"

Taking a deep breath.

The elder’s overwhelming spiritual energy burst forth, stretching his long robe.

In the next moment, a strange phenomenon occurred.

The formidable gold body elder of the Iron Ship Mansion didn’t directly punch the white-clad scholar. Instead, he veered off course, targeting the girl in black, who had each time seen the white-clad scholar unharmed, would hold back her laughter, secretly raising her two small hands to clap, doing it quickly, trying to keep the sound down, seemingly trying to avoid clapping her hands together.

In an instant.

It was as if time had come to a standstill.

The white-robed figure stood beside the girl in black, his left hand’s fingers curled, grasping the robust old man’s neck, preventing him from taking another step forward. Blood flowed from the elder’s neck, and the white-clad scholar lightly pushed his fingers against the elder's forehead, producing a dull thud as a gold body martial artist who had fought through battle arrays was sent crashing to the end of the ferry, tumbling out.

The white-clad scholar turned his head toward the second floor, lightly wiping his left hand on the railing a few times, squinting with a smile as he asked, "What do you think?"

On the viewing platform of the second floor, neither Wei Bai nor the old woman said anything.

Moments later, everyone heard sounds of commotion from afar.

Behind the ferry, a streak of golden light exploded, and then a beam of sword light appeared, belonging to a young sword cultivator with a golden hairpin, looking toward the railing and asking, "Did you cut through the thunder clouds of my Jinwu Palace with a sword?"

The white-clad scholar looked bewildered, asking, "What are you talking about?"

The young sword immortal smiled helplessly. "Once we reach Spring Dew Garden, I’ll treat you to tea."

The sword light disappeared into the distance.

The girl in black felt inexplicably that such mountain tales were quite heroic, yet she couldn’t bring herself to feel happy. Lowering her head, she walked to the white-clad scholar’s side and gently tugged at his sleeve. "I’m sorry."

He squatted down, holding her face gently, pulling her closer to him, then made a funny face, softly smiling, "What’s the matter, what’s the matter?" 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 600: Sharpening the Sword

The girl in black shyly smiled.

Suddenly, the scholar in white tugged at the golden robe draped over him and pulled it over her head. In an instant, the girl in black transformed into a girl in white. However, underneath the snow-white robe, he surprisingly wore another white robe.

Chen Ping’an’s eyes shone with clarity as he slowly rose, speaking softly, “No matter what happens next, don’t move. Don’t move a muscle. If you die today, I will make sure the entire North Canglu Continent knows you are the water monster of Dumb Lake, surnamed Zhou. Let’s call you Zhou Milk Grain then. But don’t be afraid; I will strive to protect you, just as I strive to protect certain others.”

He then turned around, his gaze sweeping over the ferry’s first and second floors, calm and unhurried, before he said indifferently, “Gao Cheng, I know you’re on this ferry. After enduring for so long, you still can’t come up with a surefire plan to kill me? Have you grown too weak since leaving your lair, or am I... too strong? If you don’t make a move soon, once we reach Spring Dew Garden, I believe your chances of success will be even slimmer.”

The passengers on the ferry were confused and couldn’t decipher what this fellow was talking about.

Only a handful of passengers vaguely felt that the name Gao Cheng sounded somewhat familiar, but they couldn’t recall it at the moment.

The ferry glided slowly over the sea of clouds, basked in sunlight, as if draped in a golden garment.

Chen Ping’an patted the sword pouch at his waist, gathering sound into a line, his lips moving as he smiled, “What’s wrong? Afraid I have a backup plan? The lord of Jingguan City, the master of the ghostly beings of Bone Barrow, surely you’re not this cowardly. You must know about the commotion over at Suijia City; I nearly died. To keep you from getting bored watching the show, I’ve reduced my five punches to three. Isn’t my hospitality just as good as yours at Bone Barrow? The first flying sword is right here with me; you and the entire Bone Barrow’s Dao are right here. Once we’ve passed this village, there’ll be no more inn.”

As expected, Gao Cheng could hear it.

He certainly heard it.

Chen Ping’an smiled, “Do you think I’m destined to never invite you to reveal yourself?”

A ferry worker hiding at the bow suddenly had his eyes turn as dark as ink. A cultivator from Silver Screen Kingdom, who had narrowly escaped at the Dragon Palace of Cangjun Lake and was seeking refuge in Spring Dew Garden, experienced the same phenomenon. Their three souls and seven spirits shattered in an instant, losing all vitality. They were completely unaware before their deaths and wouldn’t know that deep within their souls, a seed had quietly blossomed.

Two dead men emerged, one walking slowly out, the other standing by the window.

The two deceased had smiles on their faces, each speaking with ripples from their hearts. One chuckled, “Besides Zhu Quan, who else? Which ancestor of the Tragic Hemp Sect? Or did all three of them come? Hmm, they should all have come.”

The other replied, “You and I were truly alike back in the day. Seeing you now reminds me of those years where I had to wrack my brain just to survive. It was tough, but fulfilling. Those years made me live more like a human than a mere ghost.”

However, Chen Ping’an’s gaze was not on the two dead men; he continued to scan the area, gathering sound into a line, “I’ve heard that those who truly attain enlightenment at the mountain’s peak are not simply those who can leave their bodies in the realms of darkness or have external incarnations. If you hide this deeply, you must not fear the Tragic Hemp Sect discovering you. Are you so sure that I and the Tragic Hemp Sect won’t kill all the ferry passengers? Thanks to you, Gao Cheng, and He Xiaoliang, I’m beginning to act more like you. Besides, your real trump card must be a powerful Golden Core with immense killing power, or a hidden, wandering martial artist. Isn’t it hard to find? From the moment I guessed you’d leave Bone Barrow and boarded this ferry, you, Gao Cheng, have already lost.”

After a moment of silence, the dead man at the window spoke, “Is it based on gambling?”

Chen Ping’an remained the same Chen Ping’an, but his eyes narrowed like a white-robed scholar as he let out a cold laugh, “Gambling? Others get on the gambling table before they gamble. I've been gambling my whole life since I can remember! I’ve never seen a peer better at gambling than me. Cao Ci? Not good enough. Ma Kuxuan? No good either. Yang Ningsheng? Even worse.”

He rolled up his right sleeve with his left hand, took a step forward, and then rolled up his left sleeve with his right hand, taking another slow step forward. He tilted his head back, feeling a gentle breeze, and shook his sleeves. After rolling them up, the spring breeze no longer filled them, “I’ve imagined that the assassin hiding in the cesspool might be you, the one revealing a small summer coin in the alley might be you, the young escort who gifted me the water pouch might be you, and even the old monk confronting the old man in the yellow robe might be you. I even considered that the little girl beside me could be you. There’s no way out because you are Gao Cheng, so ‘what if’ becomes more frequent, more than just the thousands and hundreds of possibilities. Therefore, this journey has been quite arduous. But it’s worth it; my cultivation of the heart has never progressed so rapidly. I suggest you be a bit more capable today, or else I’ll turn around and head back to Bone Barrow. In terms of courtesy, believe me, Chen Ping’an, you and Bone Barrow will face quite a surprise.”

The “ferry worker” nodded and smiled, “I believe you. Gao Cheng, alive or dead, has never spoken of those trivial matters.”

The man at the window suddenly understood, but his face wore a sincere smile, “Got it. I overlooked the one person who most wanted you dead; it’s my loss. Regarding the incident at Suijia City, she must have been wounded on some fundamental level. If I were her, He Xiaoliang, I would have completely severed that invisible bond with you to avoid future entanglements. But since she is He Xiaoliang, she might just be hiding in that small cave paradise of her sect for now, temporarily distancing herself from you. None of this is important. What matters is that I, Gao Cheng, made an extreme mistake due to your strange relationship with that dog man and woman. When she’s present, I will certainly attack you; now that she’s gone, I will naturally attack you even more. Your thoughts are truly intriguing.”

Chen Ping’an extended his thumb and wiped the corner of his mouth, “I’m not familiar with He Xiaoliang. You can call me a dog, but don’t tie me to her. Now, how shall we say it? Are these two Golden Core ghosts going to humiliate me, or are they humiliating you, Gao Cheng?”

An old man carrying a sword slowly walked out from the back of the ferry. He appeared to have been residing in the room on the opposite side, but for some reason, his large, aged frame staggered slightly, and his face twisted as if he were struggling. Moments later, he let out a long sigh, and, using the same technique of gathering sound into a line, he sighed, “Every unprepared self will indeed transform into another person. You should take this as a warning.”

After the old man appeared, a barrier restricting the small space was suddenly cast outside the ferry.

The old man was completely unfazed.

Chen Ping’an asked, “Do you think you’re qualified to teach me?”

The old man stared at the young man in white, chuckling softly, “Are you sure that this is the kind of distinction you want?”

A drop of crimson blood seeped from the center of Chen Ping’an’s brow. He suddenly raised a hand as if signaling outsiders not to interfere.

He patted the sword pouch, and the flying sword, originally named Little Fengdu, hovered just above the mouth of the pouch. He grinned menacingly, “The flying sword is right here. Shall we have a gamble?!”

The old man gazed at the young man’s smile, his own face beaming with delight, a trace of satisfaction flickering in his eyes, “Very well. I can confirm that you and I, Gao Cheng, started out with similar backgrounds and circumstances.”

After the old man appeared, he showed no signs of drawing his sword but instead halted, “I only have one question: Why didn’t Zhu Quan and the others help you resist the heavenly tribulation back at Suijia City?”

Chen Ping’an wiped his face with his left hand, gradually erasing the smile, and replied slowly, “It’s simple. I told Sect Master Zhu from the beginning that as long as you Gao Cheng didn’t personally kill me, they wouldn’t need to show up even if I died.”

The old man nodded, “Only the Tragic Hemp Sect cultivators would agree to such a thing. Such a decision could only be made by the current you, something the former Gao Cheng could have done. In this world, it should be people like us who continuously strive to ascend.”

The old man smiled, “Don’t die at the hands of others. I’ll be waiting for you in Jingguan City. I worry that you might change your mind by then, so I suggest you break through Bone Barrow and storm Jingguan City in one go.”

The old man looked up toward the distant horizon, likely the southernmost part of North Canglu Continent, “On the path of the Dao, solitary and alone, I finally see a true companion. If I fail to kill you this time and pay the price of a soul and a spirit, upon further consideration, it’s not that hard to accept. By the way, you should thank that girl from Jinduo Temple, and this little water monster behind you. Without these two little surprises helping to stabilize your heart, no matter how careful you are, you wouldn’t have made it to this ferry. Zhu Quan and the others might be able to snatch the flying sword, but they couldn’t save your life.”

The old man flicked his sleeves, and the two dead men, one at the window and the other at the bow, were split apart by the strand of soul, completely dissipating into the heavens and earth.

It was then that the two dead men truly died, instantly turning to white bones that shattered on the ground.

The old man extended his hand around his shoulder and slowly withdrew a long sword.

Chen Ping’an remained completely still.

The old man laughed heartily, “Even if it’s just a soul and a spirit from me, three Jade Purity realm cultivators of the Tragic Hemp Sect are not worthy of such a harvest.”

After drawing the long sword, the old man sliced through his own neck inch by inch, his gaze fixed on the young man who seemed completely unperturbed, “The gods of Cangjun Lake sit high, resembling me, Gao Cheng. After the division of life and death at Bone Barrow, if you die, I’ll take you to see what a real Fengdu looks like. If I die, you can also go see it for yourself. But I really find it hard to die.”

A pure martial artist of the wandering realm just cut off his own head like that.

The head rolled on the ground, yet the headless corpse still held firmly onto the sword, standing tall and unwavering.

Instantly, a small world was isolated again on the ferry.

Three ancestors of the Tragic Hemp Sect appeared together.

Two male ancestors approached the two white bones, using their divine powers to examine and investigate each.

Zhu Quan, holding a dagger, stood beside Chen Ping’an, sighing, “Chen Ping’an, if you continue like this, it will be very dangerous.”

But Chen Ping’an replied, “I sharpen my sword with my own evil thoughts; it poses no harm to the heavens and earth.”

Zhu Quan hesitated, shaking his head, then turned to look at the headless corpse, remaining silent for a long time, “Chen Ping’an, will you become the second Gao Cheng?”

Chen Ping’an said nothing, merely smoothing out both sleeves slowly.

Zhu Quan stared at the corpse, his expression complex, “I naturally hate Gao Cheng and Jingguan City to the core, but I must admit that I have always respected Gao Cheng deeply.”

Chen Ping’an turned around, lowering his head to look at the little girl, who had remained motionless in the stagnant river of time.

Wearing that golden robe, she seemed to grow darker, which made him smile a bit.

No matter how dark, she couldn’t be darker than that little girl, right?

Zhu Quan smiled, “In any case, our Tragic Hemp Sect owes you a great favor.”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “It merely evens out.”

She withdrew her gaze, curiously asking, “Are you really going to return to Bone Barrow with us to confront Gao Cheng?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head, “Let him wait. I’ll finish my journey through North Canglu Continent first.”

Zhu Quan was left speechless, chuckling.

Chen Ping’an turned and asked, “Can you let this little girl move now?”

Zhu Quan nodded.

In an instant, the girl who had turned from black to white blinked her eyes, then froze, first looking at Chen Ping’an, then at her surroundings, a confused expression on her face. She began to furrow her light brows intensely.

Chen Ping’an crouched down, smiling as he asked, “Do you want to go to Spring Dew Garden to find a place to settle down, or do you want to visit my hometown?”

The little girl asked, “Can I choose neither and just follow you on your adventures?”

Chen Ping’an shook his head with a smile, “That’s not possible. You should visit my hometown; there are plenty of delicious and fun things, and you might even find new friends. Also, I have a friend named Xu Yuanxia, who is a great hero, and he just happens to be writing a travelogue. You can share your story with him, and he can help write it in his book.”

The little girl seemed somewhat tempted.

She suddenly recalled something, tugging at the snow-white robe that fit her surprisingly well.

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “You can keep wearing it; it doesn’t mean much to me now. I was merely using it as a ruse to fool the bad guys.”

The little girl just shook her head.

Chen Ping’an had no choice but to gently tug at the collar of his robe, then spread his hands, allowing the golden robe to drape over him on its own.

Zhu Quan clicked his tongue.

What a fine fellow; changing from a green shirt and bamboo hat into this outfit actually made him look quite handsome.

Chen Ping’an lifted her onto the railing, then leaped up beside her, the two of them sitting together. Chen Ping’an turned to Zhu Quan, asking, “Sect Master Zhu, can you please not eavesdrop for a moment?”

Zhu Quan chuckled and nodded.

Chen Ping’an gazed into the distance, his hands clenched lightly on his knees, “Did what I said earlier scare you?”

The little girl crossed her arms and snorted, “Nonsense, I’m not easily scared!”

Chen Ping’an replied, “Oh, so daring to share a chestnut with me shows you’re quite bold indeed.”

The little girl giggled.

Chen Ping’an asked, “What do you think of the name Zhou Milk Grain? You don’t know, but I have quite the reputation for naming; everyone gives me a thumbs up.”

The little girl seemed skeptical but figured having a name was better than just a surname.

Chen Ping’an took out a flask of wine from a nearby object, uncorked it, took a sip, and said, “If I’m not around in the future, you must remember one thing: evil people and their deeds are not always the fierce and terrifying ones that seem scary and indiscriminately slaughter the innocent. More often, they’re like the night winds in Huangfeng Valley, giving us discomfort without being overtly dangerous. You must be cautious of these invisible malice. Knowing this doesn’t mean you should learn to be like them; rather, it helps you cherish the goodness in the world, big or small, and understand how hard it is to come by.”

Chen Ping’an then extended his hand behind him, pointing toward the second floor of the ferry, “For instance, beyond that bad person who bumped into you and kicked you, you should be wary of that young worker who was the first to appear before me, not even a cultivator. You should be much more careful of him than the manager selling you tickets. Also, be extra cautious around that old lady’s people; not the young master, nor the young woman, but rather those inconspicuous individuals standing in the corners. They might be the one you should watch out for.”

“You must be careful of those not-so-obvious malices. One type is the clever bad people who hide deep and calculate far ahead, while another type is the foolish bad people who have instincts they are completely unaware of. Therefore, we must think more than they do and strive to be cleverer.”

“All the power we can see and pierce through—the flying swords, boxing techniques, robes, hidden depths, family backgrounds—none of these represent true strength and danger.”

The little girl furrowed her face and brows intensely. This time, she wasn’t pretending to understand; she genuinely wanted to grasp what he was saying.

Because she knew it was for her own good.

Even if she still didn’t quite understand why he had to speak of these truly difficult things for her benefit.

Then the man reached out, gently resting his hand on her head, “I know you don’t understand, but I just can’t help but say it. So I hope you go to my hometown, grow a bit more, and then venture out into the world. Growing up is not like being a little water monster from a poor family; you don’t need to rush. Take your time to grow up.”

The girl in black nodded, “I’ll remember... Alright, I won’t lie; I actually only remembered about half.”

Chen Ping’an took a sip from the wine, “It’s fine if you didn’t remember the earlier part. But the following few pieces of information must not be forgotten. First, my hometown is a place called Longquan County in Baoping Continent; I have several mountain peaks, and one of them is called Lupo Mountain. I have a top disciple named Pei Qian; you absolutely must not let slip that you’ve knocked on her master’s chestnut and not just once or twice. You don’t need to fear her; just say what I taught you—her master wants her to study and copy books diligently. That would be enough.”

At this point, Chen Ping’an retracted his hand, shaking the wine flask, smiling, “You could also add a line saying that her master misses her a lot.”

Chen Ping’an continued, “The second thing is I have a student named Cui Dongshan. If you encounter him and feel that his mind seems more muddled than anyone else’s, don’t be afraid. If he dares to bully you, just borrow a small notebook from Pei Qian, jot it down, and I will take care of it for you later. And there’s an old cook named Zhu Lian; you can tell them anything that happens. Lupo Mountain has many more people... Never mind; you can get to know them once you reach Longquan County.”

Chen Ping’an turned his head, gently calling out, “Zhou Milk Grain.”

The girl in black was busy counting her fingers to remember the information when she heard her new name and tilted her head.

Chen Ping’an opened his mouth wide, shaking his head.

The little girl rolled her eyes.

Why was he trying to imitate her, and it didn’t even look right?

Chen Ping’an tilted his head back, draining the flask of wine in one go, then wiped his mouth with his hand, bursting into laughter.

Some things he couldn’t help but share with the little girl.

But some heartfelt words remained unspoken in his heart.

When he first left his hometown, he couldn’t understand many things. Even though at that time, the boy in straw sandals from Mud Bottle Lane had only just started practicing punches, he wouldn’t lose focus, just burying his head in the journey forward.

Later, as he got older and headed for Upside-down Mountain, having practiced nearly a million punches, he found himself in a place called Jiao Long Valley, and when he heard those thoughts and voices, he felt an immense disappointment.

At Book Scroll Lake, he was a person who had nearly died several times and could almost match with a Golden Core immortal in arm wrestling, yet in a situation where his life was not in danger, he felt almost despairing.

He returned to his hometown, traveled through the central rivers and lakes of Baoping Continent, and now he had arrived at North Canglu Continent.

Cai Jinjian, Fu Nanhua, the Old Monkey of Zhengyang Mountain, the True Monarch of the River Crossing Liu Zhimiao, the Old Jiao of Jiao Long Valley, Ding Ying of Lotus Flower Blessed Land, Du Mao of Ascension Realm, Liu Laocheng of Gong Liu Island, Gao Cheng of Jingguan City...

He walked and walked, traversing countless mountains and rivers.

He learned boxing, practiced swordplay, and now had even become a cultivator.

Zhu Quan suddenly spoke up, “Chen Ping’an, we are about to leave. The flow of time in this small world has stagnated for too long; ordinary mortals won’t be able to withstand it.”

Chen Ping’an quickly turned around, patting the little girl beside him, “Our big water monster from Dumb Lake will be entrusted to Sect Master Zhu to help send her to the Niujiao Mountain ferry at Longquan County.”

The girl in black tugged at his sleeve, her face full of unease.

Chen Ping’an immediately understood, extending a palm to cover his mouth, turning around and bending down to whisper, “She’s a powerful Jade Purity realm immortal. Very formidable.”

The girl in black hurriedly raised her own palm. She only knew about Golden Core and Nascent Soul immortals, but she had never heard of the Jade Purity realm, and in a low voice asked, “How formidable? Is she as strong as the old man in the yellow robe?”

Chen Ping’an nodded, “Even stronger.”

The girl in black asked again, “How should I address her?”

Chen Ping’an whispered, “Just call her Sister Zhu; that’s definitely more appropriate than calling her Sect Master Zhu or Auntie Zhu.”

The little girl still stealthily asked, “If I don’t have enough money to ride the ferry between continents, what should I do?”

Chen Ping’an replied quietly, “Just owe it for now.”

“Is that alright?”

“It’s fine; that Sister Zhu is very wealthy, much wealthier than both of us combined.”

“But I’m still a bit scared of her.”

“Then pretend not to be scared.”

Nearby, Zhu Quan rubbed his forehead with his hand.

How did this big and little pair come together?

In the end, the little girl slung the package on her back, wanting to give it to him, but he refused.

She asked, “Is your name really Chen Good Person?”

He shook his head, smiling, “I’m Chen Ping’an, meaning ‘peaceful and safe.’”

The girl in black was held in Zhu Quan’s embrace as the two ancestors of the Tragic Hemp Sect took to the winds, of course cleaning up the mess. The Tragic Hemp Sect had to tidy up; Gao Cheng’s terrifying nature was far from just a Jade Purity realm spirit residing in Ghostly Valley. During the stasis of time, the two ancestors had thoroughly checked every passenger on the ferry, confirming that Gao Cheng had no more hidden methods. Even if he did, with that young man’s temperament and methods, he would have no fear after they left.

The small world’s restrictions quickly dissipated.

All the passengers on the ferry saw a white-robed scholar sitting by the railing, facing away from the crowd, gently patting his knees, faintly heard mumbling something about how delicious stinky tofu was.

On the observation deck of the second floor, Wei Bai from the Iron Ship Manor was about to slap the Jianghu warrior named Ding Tong, who had lost his balance and was about to fall, to death.

Unexpectedly, the white-robed scholar had already raised his hand, shaking it, “No need. Whenever you remember, I’ll come kill him myself.”

Wei Bai indeed withdrew his hand, smiling slightly, clasping his fists, “Wei Bai of the Iron Ship Manor, humbly obeying the sword immortal’s orders.”

That Jianghu warrior, who had wandered for a while in the gates of hell, was now dazed, seeming to have forgotten how to be afraid.

The white-robed scholar fell silent for a moment, turned his head to look at the warrior, and smiled, “Are you scared? You shouldn’t be, right, Gao Cheng?”

After casually asking, the white-robed scholar turned away.

The Jianghu warrior’s demeanor shifted dramatically, smiling as he crossed the observation deck, standing beside the white-robed scholar at the railing.

After he sat down, he asked with a grin, “How did you come up with that?”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “This time, I just guessed randomly. Thinking of one’s enemies as smarter isn’t a bad thing.”

He then asked, “So the so-called plan to finish North Canglu Continent before finding trouble with me is based on the assumption that I’m still around, and you intentionally said it for me to hear?”

Chen Ping’an nodded.

Gao Cheng laughed heartily, clenching his fists as he gazed into the distance, “If this world were filled with people like us, such ghosts, how wonderful it would be!”

Chen Ping’an asked, “When did you seize control over him?”

Gao Cheng shook his head, seeming regretful, sneering, “Want to know if this person truly deserves to die? It appears you and I still aren’t quite the same.”

Chen Ping’an took out two flasks of wine, keeping one for himself and tossing one to Gao Cheng. He uncorked it and took a large swig, “Back on the battlefield, so many Gao Chengs have died. After Gao Cheng rises from the grave, how many more Gao Chengs will die?”

Gao Cheng took a sip of wine and smiled, “Who could argue against that?”

Suddenly, that young man said, “So one should read more books.”

Gao Cheng casually tossed away the flask of wine, letting it fall into the sea of clouds, “Is the turtle jelly good?”

Chen Ping’an sighed, “Just a soul, and it can create so much chaos? I’m impressed. No wonder so many cultivators risk their lives to reach the mountain peak and take a look.”

Gao Cheng spread his hand, a black vortex appearing in his palm, faintly revealing extremely tiny specks of light, like the stars swirling in a river, “No hurry. Think it over, and then decide whether to send out the flying sword to me for delivery to Jingguan City.”

Chen Ping’an tugged at the corner of his mouth, patting the sword pouch, his two fingers pinching Little Fengdu, placing it into the vortex of his palm.

Gao Cheng clenched his fist and turned his head, “Killing you isn’t easy, but tricking you isn’t hard. I want to hide from the inspection of the two Jade Purity realm cultivators from the Tragic Hemp Sect. If the separated souls and spirits increase, and in the flow of time, is it truly that easy to deceive the heavens? Zhu Quan holding the Ghostly Valley is certainly not some useless person.”

Chen Ping’an remained unmoved.

Gao Cheng nodded, “That’s right.”

Gao Cheng still kept both fists clenched, “In my life, I only respect two people: one is the old sergeant who taught me not to fear death and then how to run away. He deceived me my whole life, claiming he had a beautiful daughter, only for me to find out in the end that he had nothing, his wife and children long dead. The other is that bodhisattva. Chen Ping’an, this flying sword, I can’t take it away, nor do I need to. Once you finish your journey through North Canglu Continent, it will naturally come to me.”

Gao Cheng opened his hand, and the flying sword hovered in the palm of his hand, silent and motionless.

A wisp of green smoke escaped from the warrior named Ding Tong’s seven orifices, gradually dissipating.

Chen Ping’an stood in a daze, as the flying sword returned to the sword pouch.

Ding Tong shivered, dazed, suddenly realizing he was sitting on the railing.

Upon turning his head, he found the white-robed scholar smiling, “What a coincidence, also enjoying the view?” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 601: To Draw the Sword or Not

Ding Tong leaned against the railing with both hands, utterly bewildered about why he was sitting there. He asked blankly, “Am I going to die?”

The scholar in white took out a folding fan, extending his arm to tap along the railing.

Turning his head, Ding Tong glanced towards the observation deck on the second floor of the ferry. There stood Wei Bai from the Iron Boat Manor, the enchanting Spring Dew Fairy, and an old crone with a frighteningly ugly visage. The usual crowd of spiritual masters, who didn't mind his identity as a martial artist and would drink heartily with him, now wore expressions of indifference.

On the first floor, some were watching the spectacle with curiosity, while a few secretly smiled at him. One person even gave him a thumbs-up.

Ding Tong turned away, feeling despair, then numbness, as he looked down at the sea of clouds beneath him.

With a flick of his wrist, the scholar in white unleashed a streak of golden sword light that shot upwards into the sky.

He chuckled, “Do you know why, despite you being a worthless scoundrel and the root of all problems, I’ve never laid a hand on you? That old man with a golden body could have stayed out of it, yet I chose to kill him, didn’t I?”

Ding Tong shook his head, his voice hoarse, “I don’t quite understand.”

After drawing his sword, the scholar fell silent, gazing into the distance. “The evil deeds of a seventh realm martial artist, casually committed, have an impact on this world that is worlds apart from the frantic efforts of a fifth realm martial artist like you. The smaller your territory, the more you resemble a deity wielding the power of life and death in the eyes of the weak. Moreover, that paper-thin golden body—having agreed not to kill anyone—was slain by his very first punch, targeting an outsider he had no grievances with. I could accept that, so I sincerely let him take a second and third punch, only for him to seek his own demise afterward. As for you, you should thank that young man who called me ‘Sword Immortal’ for stopping you from jumping off the observation deck to challenge me. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been the elder blocking the disaster for you, but you yourself. To put it bluntly, you don’t deserve to die, especially since that Gao Cheng left a little suspense behind, intentionally making things difficult. It’s fine; I’ll assume you were like me back in the day, ensnared by someone else’s Dao, thus driven to do such ‘desperate acts.’”

“Reason isn’t something only the weak can use to complain and seek justice; it isn’t mere words that require kneeling and bowing to express.”

Ding Tong’s mind was blank; he hardly absorbed any of it. He was just pondering whether to wait for that sword to descend and then die or to muster some heroic spirit and jump from the ferry, becoming a wind-faring eighth realm martial artist.

The scholar in white did not speak further.

You people are like those warriors who ride up the mountain to seek death, inadvertently trampling a few pedestrians who merely got in your way. The road of life is fraught with hidden dangers, a perfect ground for committing evil.

In the countryside, in the marketplace, in the martial world, in the official circles, on the mountains.

Such people are countless.

Parents, teachers, and even descendants follow this path.

There’s no stopping it.

Back in the Golden Bell Temple of the Huaihuang Kingdom, why did that young girl feel sad and disappointed?

Because the intentionally aloof scholar Chen Ping'an, if you set aside his true identity and cultivation, displayed behavior on the road that was indistinguishable from those who rode up the mountain to seek death.

What hurt her the most wasn’t the scholar’s pedantry, but that question, “If I were knocked out and someone else stole my book box, would you pay me back?” Such words and mentality were what truly saddened that young girl. She extended kindness to the world and others, but instead of gratitude, he returned malice. Yet, what was good about the Golden Bell Temple girl was that even amidst her sorrow, she genuinely cared for the safety of that foolish and wicked person. Now, Chen Ping'an could only tell himself, “Doing good can lead to harm; it’s my own business.” Thus, he believed she was better than him and deserved to be called a good person.

The scholar in white remained silent, both awaiting the return of the disciples from the Pei Ma Sect and listening to his own thoughts.

Gao Cheng’s probing wasn’t particularly brilliant, but his open schemes were somewhat impressive.

The scholar in white pressed his folding fan against his chest and muttered to himself, “This time, being caught off guard has nothing to do with the Pei Ma Sect. Even I know that shifting blame to the Pei Ma Sect isn’t in line with my nature. How can I be so petty as to let a few ants use tricks I can see through? Gao Cheng slightly exceeded your control, and you can’t bear this little grievance? Cultivators like you, with your mindset and practice, you’re not much better. Just behave like the sword-wielding hero you are; don’t think of becoming a Sword Immortal.”

Zhu Quan, through the ripples of his heart lake, indicated that their swords would meet deep in the sea of clouds. If they were to perform that feat of dividing heaven and earth again, the ordinary folks on the ferry would truly dissipate into nothingness. After disembarking, they would head straight south, sword-faring ten miles.

Chen Ping'an stood up, taking a step forward as a golden sword light descended from the heavens, perfectly hovering beneath his feet. In a flash, he and the sword vanished.

Within the sea of clouds, besides Zhu Quan and the two elders of the Pei Ma Sect, there was another unfamiliar old Daoist, dressed in a style of Daoist robe never before seen, clearly not belonging to any of the three branches, nor was he a priest from the Dragon Tiger Mountain’s heavenly master manor. As Chen Ping'an hovered on his sword, a middle-aged Daoist broke through the sea of clouds, striding from afar, shrinking the mountains and rivers to mere footsteps.

The middle-aged Daoist spoke in a deep voice, “The formation is complete. Should Gao Cheng dare to use the power of observation to probe us, he’ll suffer a bit.”

Zhu Quan appeared slightly awkward but replied, “It was my fault for not finding any traces of Gao Cheng on that martial artist.”

The old Daoist hesitated for a moment, seeing the elder of the Pei Ma Sect shaking his head beside him, so he refrained from speaking.

Chen Ping'an shook his head, saying, “I lost to Gao Cheng; I was outwitted. I can’t blame anyone else.”

Zhu Quan still held the black-clad young girl in his arms, who had already fallen soundly asleep.

Zhu Quan remained unreserved, straightforwardly stating, “After we left earlier, we kept an eye on the ferry, fearing something might happen. What we feared indeed occurred; we overheard your conversation with Gao Cheng. When Gao Cheng scattered his remnants, the young girl took a deep breath, and then a wisp of blue smoke escaped her lips, just like that martial artist. It should have been tampered with in that herbal concoction. Fortunately, this time, I can assure you, besides Gao Cheng possibly staying in Jingguan City and using the power of observation against us, I can guarantee that there are no further schemes regarding the young girl.”

The middle-aged Daoist’s tone was indifferent, yet it seemed to carry a mocking undertone, “You disregarded the entire Bone Marsh and even the entire southern region of the Ju Lu Continent for one person. If you, Chen Ping'an, had weighed the pros and cons, thought it over for a long time, and then acted, I would have nothing to say as an outsider. But you, on the other hand, acted without hesitation.”

A single word from Chen Ping'an nearly stirred the middle-aged Daoist’s heart lake, “You’re not very skilled in the Dao.”

The middle-aged Daoist scoffed, “Since you’re so loyal and righteous, picking up a little water monster on the road, you’re willing to part with your precious treasures. If I were a villain and encountered you, it would truly be a great fortune.”

The Daoist saw the scholar in white, who picked up his folding fan and gently tapped his own forehead, “You’re even higher in realm than Du Mao?”

The middle-aged Daoist sneered, “Though I don’t know the specifics, you’re merely at this level now. I can only assume you were even more lacking back then. Facing an ascendant, you, Chen Ping'an, avoiding disaster wasn’t due to your own strength, but relied on that hidden protector? No wonder you dared to threaten Gao Cheng, proclaiming you would go to the Ghostly Abyss Valley to give Jingguan City a surprise. Do you need me to help you send a message across the continent with my flying sword?”

The scholar in white smiled, “Do you know that my protector doesn’t even look at you? Isn’t that frustrating?”

The middle-aged Daoist’s expression darkened, then he smiled again, “Not frustrated. I just find you unpleasant. A half-baked sword cultivator who would be seen as a peer by Gao Cheng, with a powerful protector, plus the depth of character you possess at such a young age. Gao Cheng has keen eyes; he’s accurate in judging people. You’re not bad either; being able to converse with Gao Cheng, the lord of the Ghostly Abyss Valley, is impressive. If this were to spread, anyone who could offer Gao Cheng a jar of wine and have him finish it would make your name, Chen Ping'an, echo across all the mountain sects overnight.”

The scholar in white replied, “You can stop talking now. I’m only being polite because of Sect Master Zhu; your speaking time has run out.”

The middle-aged Daoist smiled, “A spar, perhaps? Don’t you think you’re quite strong?”

The scholar in white said, “Then, seeing as it’s your master’s cup of thousand-year peach nectar tea, I’ll say one more thing.”

The middle-aged Daoist waited for a moment.

But the scholar remained silent, merely gazing at him with a look of pity.

Suddenly, the Daoist realized that the so-called additional comment was merely that single statement.

Zhu Quan felt a bit worried.

She was genuinely afraid that if the two continued chatting, they might roll up their sleeves and start fighting. At that point, it would be hard for her to help either side, and it wasn’t in her nature to stand by while they fought. Perhaps she could openly mediate, then give them a few hits each? She was good at fighting but not at mediation, so there were bound to be some accidental injuries.

The old Daoist spoke softly, “It’s fine; this is good for both Chen Ping'an and me, this disciple.”

Zhu Quan sighed and said, “Chen Ping'an, since you’ve guessed it, I won’t elaborate further. These two Daoist masters come from the Ghostly Abyss Valley’s Little Xuan Du Temple. They were invited out of the mountain. You know, our Pei Ma Sect has our strengths in killing, but facing a schemer like Gao Cheng, we still need the watchful eyes of a Daoist master like you.”

Chen Ping'an nodded without speaking.

This old Daoist from Little Xuan Du Temple was said to be the temporary protector of Yang Ningxing, as per Jiang Shangzhen.

That night, at the cliffside of the Iron Chain Bridge, this Daoist, who aspired to the position of Celestial Lord, guarded all night, fearing that Chen Ping'an might kill Yang Ningxing directly.

As for that cup of thousand-year peach nectar tea delivered by a golden-armored divine being, whether it was inspired by a Daoist true lord’s whim or was a courtesy akin to Gao Cheng’s, Chen Ping'an knew little about the Little Xuan Du Temple, having too few threads of connection to deduce the true intentions of the other side for now.

Chen Ping'an glanced at the young girl in Zhu Quan’s arms and said, “I may need to trouble Sect Master Zhu with one more thing. It’s not that I don’t trust the Pei Ma Sect and your master, but I don’t trust Gao Cheng. So I’d like to ask the Pei Ma Sect, using the cross-continental ferry, to send the young girl to Longquan County and inform Wei Bo from the Cloudy Peak that I need him to find someone named Cui Dongshan. Just tell him I want Cui Dongshan back at the Ruin Mountain immediately to investigate the young girl’s spirit.”

Chen Ping'an trusted the disciples of the Pei Ma Sect, but he truly didn’t trust the old master from Little Xuan Du Temple, who taught that troublesome disciple Xu Song.

The middle-aged Daoist frowned.

He had heard that Wei Bo of Cloudy Peak, as the righteous deity of the Northern Yue of Dali, was expected to ascend to the Jade Purity Realm immediately. Now in the Northern Yue territory, there had already been some faint signs of auspiciousness.

Zhu Quan, being straightforward, asked, “Is Cui Dongshan reliable?”

Chen Ping'an replied slowly, “If he’s not reliable, then no one is.”

The old Daoist smiled and said, “It’s indeed wise to be cautious. I can only promise to do my best. If I fail to uncover any clues on the young girl, and if there’s a flaw in our precautions, the consequences will be severe. Having one more person to investigate is a good thing.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Thank you for your generosity, master.”

The old Daoist smiled and brushed it off.

Zhu Quan, seeing that the conversation was nearing its end, suddenly said, “Masters, you go ahead; I’ll stay back to talk privately with Chen Ping'an.”

The middle-aged Daoist stored away the formation of the sea of clouds.

Not to mention anything else, this Daoist’s methods had already shown Chen Ping'an the profound and ruthless nature of mountain techniques.

It turned out that one person’s power of observation could potentially backfire.

The two Daoists from Little Xuan Du Temple, along with the two elders of the Pei Ma Sect, first rode the wind southward.

Zhu Quan got straight to the point, “That senior disciple of the master is someone who enjoys saying strange things. I’ve been annoyed with him for quite some time but couldn’t act against him. However, he’s very skilled in fighting. It’s said that he learned about seventy to eighty percent of the Little Xuan Du Temple’s ultimate techniques. You don’t need to worry about him now; when your realm is high enough, just beat him half to death.”

Chen Ping'an put away his folding fan and, riding his sword, approached Zhu Quan, extending his hand. She handed the young girl to this young Sword Immortal, teasing, “You, a big man, can also hold a child? What’s this, learning from Jiang Shangzhen, hoping to deceive women in the martial world with such tricks?”

Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged, cradling the young girl in his arms. Her soft snoring brought a smile to his face; he looked both cheerful and slightly melancholic. “When I was younger, I used to hold children and play with them every day.”

Zhu Quan glanced at the young man and thought that he probably wasn’t joking.

Zhu Quan sat on the sea of clouds, hesitating whether to speak, which was an unprecedented occurrence.

Chen Ping'an didn’t raise his head but seemed to read her mind, slowly saying, “I’ve always felt that Sect Master Zhu is the smartest person in the Bone Marsh; you’re just too lazy to think and act.”

Zhu Quan nodded, “Then I understand; I believe you.”

Then she laughed, “However, regarding your words with Gao Cheng, which are half-truths and half-lies, even I, who am familiar with you, would have doubts. How much more for the old master who isn’t acquainted with you and that temperamental disciple of his?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “The earlier statements were all true. I’ve already prepared for the worst; if the young girl dies on the ferry, I can only take revenge. It’s that simple. As for the rest, it’s not worth mentioning. We’re both probing each other, trying to glimpse a bit more of one another’s thought processes. Gao Cheng is also worried; having followed me all the way, the results are what I intentionally let him see. He fears losing twice in a row; if he fails again, he won’t even have the heart to vie for that little Fengdu. Ultimately, it’s just a tug-of-war in terms of mindset.”

Chen Ping'an freed one hand, gently tapping the sword nurturing gourd at his waist. The flying sword, known as the First, slowly emerged, hovering on his shoulder in an unusually docile manner. Chen Ping'an calmly stated, “Some of Gao Cheng’s words are also true, such as his feeling that I’m really one of his kind. Perhaps he believes we both rely on a series of bets, slowly straightening that nearly crushed backbone until we rise higher and higher. Just as you respect Gao Cheng, you wouldn’t hesitate to kill him, even if it’s merely a loss of his soul. Sect Master Zhu would feel that she owes me, Chen Ping'an, a great favor. I wouldn’t fail to see his strengths just because he’s my mortal enemy.”

Zhu Quan responded with an “Mm,” “That’s how it should be. Separate the matters and act accordingly. There are many secret affairs in the sect that I can’t disclose to outsiders. Anyway, that Gao Cheng is not simple. For instance, if I, Zhu Quan, were to completely kill Gao Cheng and turn Jingguan City upside down, I would still bring out a good wine to honor the past soldier Gao Cheng and toast to the current lord of Jingguan City. Lastly, I would toast Gao Cheng for tempering our Pei Ma Sect’s Dao heart.”

Chen Ping'an said, “I don’t know why, but in this world, some people always think it’s a great thing to bare their teeth at every villain, and so many like to discuss matters of the heart when it’s time for reason, yet when it’s time for reason, they talk about matters of the heart.”

Zhu Quan thought for a moment, then clapped her hands heavily on Chen Ping'an’s shoulder, “Bring out the wine; let’s have two jars. I must surpass Gao Cheng!” After drinking the wine, I’ll share some heartfelt words with you!”

Chen Ping'an produced two jars of wine and handed them to Zhu Quan, quietly reminding, “When you drink the wine, remember to disperse the scent; otherwise, she might wake up. When she sees me, it’ll take a lot of persuasion to get her to the Bone Marsh. This young girl has been craving my wine for quite some time. Regarding the herbal concoction, it’s fine if Sect Master Zhu speaks frankly to her; she’s actually very brave and harbors no malicious intent.”

Zhu Quan downed one jar of wine, leaving it completely empty.

She raised her head in a bold manner, paying no mind to the spill of at least two portions of wine.

Chen Ping'an said helplessly, “Sect Master Zhu, you really need to change this habit of yours. Every time you drink wine, you must pay respect to heaven and earth?”

Zhu Quan laughed in anger, “You’ve already given me the wine; what does it matter to you?”

Chen Ping'an looked into the distance, smiling, “If I could be friends with Sect Master Zhu, that would be wonderful, but if we were to go into business together, I’d probably cry to death.”

Zhu Quan regained her composure, growing somewhat serious, “The true strength of a cultivator isn’t just to coexist harmoniously with this world, even if they stand out and are exceptional. Rather, it’s about how much they can change the world beyond the path to immortality… to put it bluntly in the ruthless terms of the mountains, regardless of whether the outcome is good or bad, it has nothing to do with the goodness or wickedness of the hearts of men. As long as they change the world significantly, they are the strong; we must acknowledge this!”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “After recognizing them as strong, to still dare to strike at them is the true mark of strength.”

Zhu Quan nodded, lifting the seal from the jar. This time, as she drank, she began to practice thriftiness, sipping slowly. It wasn’t that her temperament had changed; she had always been this way.

When the wine was ample, she would drink heartily; when it was scarce, she would sip slowly.

Chen Ping'an turned to Zhu Quan, smiling, “In fact, one of my students once said something akin to what Sect Master Zhu mentioned. He said a country’s true strength isn’t its ability to cover up mistakes but rather its capability to correct them.”

Zhu Quan laughed, “I don’t care much about matters down the mountain. In this lifetime, dealing with a Ghostly Abyss Valley and a Gao Cheng is enough for me to drink one jar. However, in the future, Du Wensi and Pang Lanxi from the Pei Ma Sect will definitely do better than me. You can wait and see.”

Zhu Quan took a deep breath and asked, “There are some questions that might make people uncomfortable, but I’ll ask them anyway. It’s better to let you feel uncomfortable alongside me than to keep it bottled up inside. Otherwise, no matter how much I drink, it won’t be worth it. You said you could give Jingguan City a surprise. Since you stated it in the beginning, it’s true. I naturally can’t guess how you’ll do it, and I don’t care. After all, you, regardless of anything else, act with caution. You’re ruthless to others but most ruthless to yourself. In that case, you can’t fault that old Daoist of Little Xuan Du Temple, worrying that you might become a second Gao Cheng or ally with him.”

Chen Ping'an nodded, “I can understand this seemingly common-sense thought, but I don’t accept it.”

Zhu Quan asked straightforwardly, “So when Gao Cheng used the herbal concoction to coerce you into producing this flying sword on your shoulder, were you truly deceived by him?”

Chen Ping'an didn’t hesitate to nod, “Yes. So in the future, when facing a Jade Purity Realm cultivator, I’ll think more about their techniques and methods beyond killing.”

Zhu Quan pressed further, “So you made the decision in that moment between the First and the young girl, sacrificing the First to save the young girl?”

Chen Ping'an nodded again, “Otherwise? If the young girl died, where would I find her? As for the First, even if Gao Cheng wasn’t deceiving me, truly capable of taking the sword and throwing it to Jingguan City, what difference would it make?”

Chen Ping'an squinted, a strange smile creeping onto his face, “Do you know how much I hoped Gao Cheng would take the flying sword? It would allow me to do something I’ve never done in all these years, something I’ve never done once, yet something both the mountains and the world cherish and believe is natural!”

Chen Ping'an pressed his hand to his brow, relaxing his expression. Gently, he handed the sleeping young girl back to Zhu Quan, slowly rising to his feet. With a flick of his wrist, his sleeves rolled up quickly.

Chen Ping'an stood atop the Sword Immortal, amidst the misty sea of clouds.

His gaze was fervent: “If Gao Cheng truly took the flying sword, I, Chen Ping'an, would have no choice left. That would be a most interesting matter. Sect Master Zhu, can you guess how I’d respond?”

Zhu Quan held the young girl, standing up, and smiled, “I can’t guess.”

The scholar in white continued, “I would first let someone named Li Er, a tenth realm martial artist, repay me a favor by heading to the Bone Marsh. I would ask my temporarily only a Nascent Soul disciple to come and ease my worries by rushing over to the Bone Marsh. For the first time in all these years, I, Chen Ping'an, would seek help! I would ask that old man, who is also at the peak of the tenth realm martial arts, to leave his bamboo house and strike for his half-disciple, Chen Ping'an, once. Since I’m asking for help, there’s no need for hesitation; I would finally ask a sword cultivator named Zuo You, stating that my little junior brother is in trouble and on the verge of death, requesting my elder brother to draw his sword! At that time, it would only be a matter of beating him until the heavens and earth turn upside down!”

The dignified Sect Master of the Pei Ma Sect, who dared to draw her sword against Gao Cheng, Zhu Quan, felt a hint of… fear.

That young man exuded a pure momentum that had nothing to do with good or evil.

He raised a hand, stamping his foot, causing the half-immortal weapon of the Sword Immortal to plummet straight down, as he calmly said, “If Gao Cheng doesn’t die from this, or if one or two ascendants emerge from somewhere, it doesn’t matter. I won’t need to seek help; I won’t ask anyone.”

Zhu Quan watched as he burst into loud laughter, ultimately speaking softly, as if whispering to someone, “I have a sword that accompanies me on my journey.”

The half-immortal weapon that had wanted to return hesitated, not daring to approach, floating far at the edge of the sea of clouds.

But in the end, Zhu Quan saw that the young man lowered his head, gazing at his rolled-up sleeves, shedding silent tears. Then he slowly raised his left hand, tightly gripping one of his sleeves, choking back his words, “Qin Xiansheng died because of me. The person who should never let him down the most is not me, Chen Ping'an, right? How can I do this? Anyone can, but I, Chen Ping'an, cannot.”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 602: Meeting My Cui Dongshan (1)

Zhu Quan remained silent for a long time before finally speaking with a teasing tone, “Aren’t you still one realm short? Do you really consider yourself a Wind-Controlling Realm martial artist?”

Underfoot, the sword immortal Chen Ping'an lightly tapped his foot, the cloud sea beneath him solidified like a slab of white jade. The mystical arts of immortals were indeed profound, and he smiled as he replied, “Thanks.”

Zhu Quan chuckled, “Now that you’ve said it, do you feel a bit relieved?”

Chen Ping'an cradled the back of his head, “Much better.”

Zhu Quan shook his head, “Just talking a few words and venting some foul air won’t truly help you. If you continue like this, you’ll end up crushing yourself. A person's spirit and energy are not merely about the will behind a punch, nor can they be tempered down to a single grain of mustard seed, and then unleashed to create chaos. Sustained spirit must be upright and proper. But some of my words as an outsider, even if they sound good to me, may come off as standing by and talking without the pain. Take this pursuit of Gao Cheng for example; if I, Zhu Quan, were to be in your shoes with equal cultivation, I would have died dozens of times already.”

Chen Ping'an sincerely said, “That’s why I admire Sect Master Zhu. The path of the Great Dao is arduous, yet you walk it with such openness.”

Very few cultivators standing at the mountain’s peak would, having done their utmost, admit, “I was wrong. I owe you a huge favor.”

Zhu Quan withdrew a hand and waved it dismissively, “No need for flattery. I don’t have any copies of the Divine Maiden’s Chart to give you.”

Chen Ping'an laughed, “I’ll lie down for a bit. Sect Master Zhu, please don’t think I’m being disrespectful.”

Zhu Quan extended a hand, “There’s no drink I can’t settle with a bottle of wine.”

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to retrieve wine from the nearby items, Zhu Quan shot him a glare, “It must be good wine! Don’t try to pass off some cheap local brew on me. I grew up on the mountain, and I can’t pretend to be a commoner. I’ve spent my life enduring the bones of the skeletons at the mouth of Ghostly Valley, and I have no nostalgia for home!”

Chen Ping'an hesitated; the celestial brews in his nearby items were limited. With Zhu Quan’s flair for demanding wine, he really couldn't satisfy her repeated requests.

Yet, wine had to be fetched. Not only that, he directly retrieved three jars of different celestial brews: osmanthus wine from Old Dragon City, spring well wine from Bee Tail Ferry, and purple horse sweat from Book Scroll Lake. He tossed them over one by one. As expected, Zhu Quan caught two jars, stowing them in her sleeve with a hint of embarrassment, “This is a bit too much; how could I accept all this?”

Lying on the cloud sea that felt like a slab of jade, Chen Ping'an recalled lying years ago in the bamboo corridor of Cui Dongshan’s cliffside academy. It wasn’t his hometown, but it felt like home nonetheless.

He had indeed grown tired after leaving the Bone Marsh.

Zhu Quan sat beside him, gently placing the small girl in black clothing next to her. She waved her sleeve, allowing the gale from the heavens to circumvent the girl like water around a pillar. The girl continued to sleep peacefully, worry-free and untroubled.

As Zhu Quan sipped her wine, she mused, “If we follow your earlier reasoning, if Gao Cheng were to know he was doomed and, with the thought of taking everyone down with him, dragged the capital of Jingguan City and Ghostly Valley into the grave together, not only would Muwu Mountain be shattered, but the Bone Marsh would also be destroyed. The flowing waters of the Wobbling River would certainly be implicated, and with the dark energy from Ghostly Valley spreading upstream, how many millions in those countries would perish? It truly would be a ‘devastating blow’.”

Chen Ping'an replied, “It’s not a ‘if’, it’s a ‘ten thousand’.”

Zhu Quan sighed, “Indeed.”

Chen Ping'an continued, “Does Sect Master Zhu know how many people flow through the mural city every day, the citizens at the Naihui Pass market, or the number of sects at the Bone Marsh? Do you know the population across the countries upstream of the Wobbling River?”

Zhu Quan paused, “Why should I know these things? I can hardly keep track of myself while climbing the turtle and managing the sect, it’s exhausting.”

Chen Ping'an explained, “While passing through the Bone Marsh, I observed, calculated, and inquired. I’ve read about it.”

Zhu Quan helplessly said, “Chen Ping'an, what exactly is going on in that head of yours all day?”

Chen Ping'an rested his hands behind his head, “Since leaving Muwu Mountain, I see everyone as Gao Cheng. After reaching the ghost house in Suijia City, I see everyone as myself. So I’m also quite tired.”

Zhu Quan queried, “Then why did you come to North Julu Prefecture? This is a place where people love to fight to the death. If you’re so afraid of dying, couldn’t you have waited until your realm was higher? Moreover, your escape techniques are still too few; your foundation remains that of a pure martial artist. So at most, you can rely on a semi-immortal weapon and a few talismans to create some distance. But let’s not talk about our fifth realm and earth immortal cultivators—who among them can’t travel thousands of miles in a single breath? If you cannot get close and quickly determine life or death, you’ll get worn out.”

Zhu Quan slapped her forehead, “Forget it, I didn’t say anything. You’re quite the oddity.”

Dressed in a robe, and wearing two at that, with a sword-breeding gourd hanging from her side, hiding not one but two flying swords that weren’t even her life’s object. 

She could pretend to be a lower fifth realm cultivator, a sword cultivator, or even a fourth or fifth realm martial artist at will, employing countless tricks to confuse others. But once it came down to a life-or-death struggle, it would inevitably lead to a sudden close combat where she could punch a master to death, plus a few talismans and a few sword strikes. An ordinary Golden Core cultivator would genuinely struggle against Chen Ping'an's three tricks. Moreover, this kid could really take a beating; Zhu Quan felt a bit itchy to try him out. 

Why did this Golden Body Realm martial artist from the Great View Dynasty treat Chen Ping'an as if he were just playfully scratching a young girl?

Chen Ping'an suddenly said, “Actually, I haven’t quite reached the Golden Body Realm yet. Though I faced significant losses in Suijia City’s tribulation cloud sea, I’ve used up almost all my good talismans, yet tempering my body has greatly benefited me. The results are better than at home in the bamboo house. After all, when you’re being fed punches at home, you know the other party won’t actually kill you; it just hurts a bit. It’s not like being caught in the tribulation cloud sea, where you could genuinely die. But even so, I’m still two points away from breaking through the Golden Body bottleneck: one point is that I haven’t formed the courage of a hero, and the other is due to my mixed martial arts training. I’m greedy and try to learn too much, which inevitably leads to clashes in styles, so I’ve never been able to achieve the effects of a spring thunder explosion or a punch that opens up mountains.”

Zhu Quan asked curiously, “And you’re still a sixth realm martial artist?!”

Chen Ping'an nodded.

Zhu Quan laughed in disbelief, “Then why aren’t all our seventh realm martial artists in North Julu Prefecture dead?”

Chen Ping'an pondered, “You can’t say it that way; otherwise, besides Cao Ci, all pure martial artists below the mountain peak would be dead.”

Zhu Quan took a sip of wine, “Cao Ci is a guy even I’ve heard of. How do you know him?”

Chen Ping'an replied, “I lost three matches to him on the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Zhu Quan’s eyes widened.

This time it was Chen Ping'an who felt a bit embarrassed, “It's a bit shameful.”

But he quickly regained his resolve, wearing a smile as the clouds and winds brushed against him, “It’s fine. In the path of martial arts, as long as I am not two realms apart from Cao Ci, as long as I stay within one realm’s difference, I’ll have hope to win back one day!”

Zhu Quan realized he had misunderstood him. How many young martial artists in the world could make Cao Ci stay and spar with them three times? It was like who in the world of chess would play a few more games with the Lord of White Emperor City? Only that traitor Cui Zhan would dare to do so. Of course, even more impressive was someone like Qi Jingchun, who could get the Lord of White Emperor City to leave the city and personally invite him to play chess. The disciples of the Literary Saint’s lineage were indeed few, but each was formidable. 

When Qi Jingchun took on that shocking catastrophe, Zhu Quan had seen some hints while at Muwu Mountain, as Bone Marsh was located at the southernmost part of North Julu Prefecture, while Great Li was at the northernmost part of Baoping Prefecture.

Moreover, there was the sword cultivator who began practicing late, yet wielded an incredibly long sword energy that caused countless destruction. It was said he visited the Immortal Seekers overseas and distanced himself from the mortal realm... Back then, four sword immortals had appeared near the territories of North Julu Prefecture, but after questioning the sword, all three remained silent. Only the first sword immortal who rushed over to intercept, one of the strongest Jade Purity Realm sword cultivators, upon returning, directly proclaimed to the entire North Julu Prefecture, “Don’t go to the Jade Purity Realm; the immortals are stepping in!”

There were many stories about the Literary Saint’s disciples. Compared to the splendid talents of the Sub-Sage lineage, the Literary Saint’s lineage had almost become extinct. Few disciples, yet many stories. North Julu Prefecture was perhaps the place most favorable to the Literary Saint’s lineage in the world.

The reason was simple: they could fight. Zhu Quan especially admired that one, who was straightforward and blunt. That fierce temper—tch, tch, tch—was even more robust than the entirety of North Julu Prefecture. It was said he looked handsome and scholarly... but when it came to fighting, he could make sword immortals in North Julu Prefecture feel that such a person should not have been born there and was too solitary, disliking the mortal world. What a shame, or else they could practice swordsmanship every day.

Zhu Quan chuckled, wiping her mouth. If she could meet him, it would be a delight.

As for this young man misunderstanding her, let him; if he thought losing three matches was embarrassing, so be it.

Wait a minute!

Zhu Quan stiffly turned her head, her expression turning fierce, “Chen Ping'an, who do you say is your senior brother?! Which Qi is Mr. Qi?!”

Damn it, at first, she was slightly taken aback by his imposing aura. A tenth realm martial artist owing a favor, with a student who was a Nascent Soul and another so-called half-master, plus that peak tenth realm martial artist, had already made her head spin. She was more worried that this young man’s mental state might shatter at any moment. Now that she finally snapped back to her senses, Zhu Quan angrily questioned, “How is he your senior brother?!”

The white-clothed scholar blinked innocently, “What is Sect Master Zhu talking about? Are you drunk from the wine?”

Zhu Quan stood up, her face beaming with a smile, plopping down next to Chen Ping'an and whispering, “Let’s make a deal. When your senior brother—the one who uses the sword—comes to Muwu Mountain as a guest, just say someone wants to treat him to a drink. If he’s unwilling to come ashore, it’s fine. I can go find him at sea. Later, you, Chen Ping'an, can help with the arrangements, and I’ll invite Pang Shanling to accompany me. I’ll stand beside him and have the old man Pang draw us a picture. Oh, how embarrassing that would be.”

Chen Ping'an rubbed his forehead. If you’re embarrassed, don’t say it out loud!

Zhu Quan was enraged, “Don’t play dumb with me! Just one sentence: is it okay or not?!”

Chen Ping'an rubbed his face, truly feeling a headache. Moreover, such matters weren’t something to joke about. He spoke plainly, “He doesn’t feel he has the qualifications to take me as his junior brother. He said this in front of me. That’s why I said I would ask; it’s not guaranteed.”

Zhu Quan swung her hand, causing Chen Ping'an to lean back. Once her arm passed over his head, he straightened up.

Zhu Quan reluctantly retracted her hand and smiled, “How about I return your wine to you? Is that acceptable?”

Chen Ping'an shook his head, “Not at all.”

Zhu Quan slapped her knee, “You’re so indecisive! No wonder your senior brother won’t acknowledge you as a junior brother.”

But until this moment, Zhu Quan began to understand.

Why this young man would say that about that disciple of the temple master.

If Zuo came to North Julu Prefecture, he truly wouldn’t spare a glance at that little Xuan Du Temple Nascent Soul Daoist, not even a glance.

It wasn’t purely due to the realm disparity; other than the sword immortals of Central Plains, it wasn’t just that for Zuo, it wasn’t merely a matter of whether you were in the Ascension realm or a commoner—he wouldn’t look at you at all.

This was also a key reason why sword cultivators in North Julu Prefecture held Zuo in such high regard.

It was also about temperament.

Zhu Quan glanced at the sky, her temper flaring, “No, we have to go. I mentioned discussing personal matters before, yet I didn’t expect to linger this long. If I’m late, those two pretentious master uncles of mine, what kind of character they are, I don’t need to explain. They’d be thrilled if any blind man was willing to marry me, and they might even shed a few tears, treating that man like a Buddha. Oh no, if those two old geezers look at me with that kind of gaze, they’ll surely think I’m out here mixing around with you in the cloud sea. Damn it, my lifetime of reputation will be ruined in an instant; this old cow eating tender grass will definitely spread through Muwu Mountain.”

Then Zhu Quan didn’t even feel how wronged she was, only to see that young man looking more flustered than herself. He quickly stood up, took two steps back, and seriously said, “I implore Sect Master Zhu to absolutely, definitely, must nip these rumors in the bud! Otherwise, I’ll never go to Muwu Mountain again!”

Zhu Quan was puzzled. This kid was fearless against Gao Cheng and hadn’t even frowned. Why was he so pale now?

Am I really that unappealing? Fine, I don’t look that great.

Zhu Quan hadn’t even reached out yet, and that little rascal had already pulled out a jar of celestial wine. Not only that, but he also said, “I really don’t have many jars left. Just let me owe you this one, and when I’ve traveled through North Julu Prefecture, I’ll definitely bring you more good wine.”

Zhu Quan waved her hand, having already accepted three jars of good wine from him. She hadn’t even finished the one in her hands.

Unexpectedly, he had already tossed the wine back, “Sect Master Zhu, I’ll owe you the rest for now. If I really don’t get to visit Muwu Mountain, I’ll have someone send wine there.”

Then he raised his hand, recalling that sword immortal beneath him, and swiftly flew away on his sword.

Zhu Quan gently lifted the small girl in black, bewildered, “This kid doesn’t lack for girls liking him, and he’s quite opinionated. At such a young age, his skills are considerable. Why is he still like this?”

Zhu Quan shook her head, not wanting to think further. After Gao Cheng suffered such a big loss, Ghostly Valley would likely not remain peaceful.

She flew south with the wind.

As for some things, it wasn’t that she didn’t want to elaborate, it was simply unspeakable.

Heart knots must be unraveled by oneself.

Especially for those who seemed to dislike getting stuck in a rut, ironically, they were the ones who got stuck.

It was truly a challenge even for immortals to untangle.

On the ferry, the white-clothed scholar, with a sword on his back, landed on the railing, his toes lightly tapping, the snow-white sleeves fluttering, directly sweeping back through the window, which closed on its own.

The still figure, Ding Tong, who had been “watching the scenery,” relaxed his heart, directly falling back onto the deck.

The observation deck on the second floor was already deserted. In fact, all guests had retreated back inside.

The ferry was even worried that a sudden sword might strike down, and then it would all be over.

That person who had sold a stack of reports to the little water monster earlier was not feeling much better than Ding Tong.

Two brothers facing the same plight.

The most terrifying aspect was not that the young sword immortal had high cultivation.

But rather, his temperament was unpredictable.

Otherwise, after a single sword strike, life and death would be a matter of course. It would just come down to bowing and begging for mercy, compensating with money or life.

However, when a person capable of deciding life and death looks at you with a smile as if he’s looking at his child, speaks in a friendly tone as if you’re good buddies, and employs endless ingenious means that you can’t even imagine...

What can you do? And what dare you do?

On Wei Bai’s side, the atmosphere was heavy, caught in this dilemma.

Logically, the death of a great tribute from the Iron Ship Court, a martial artist with battlefield experience at the Golden Body realm, was a significant loss for the Wei family, and Wei Bai should weigh the strengths of both sides. However, after discussing with the old lady inside, it seemed they couldn’t come up with a suitable countermeasure. It felt like anything they said could lead to more mistakes, with unpredictable consequences, and they might not even survive to step off the ferry, let alone stabilize the situation at Chunlu Garden later. Yet doing nothing felt like seeking death.

A gentle knock on the door sounded.

The old lady’s face looked extremely grim.

Because she hadn’t noticed any movement; the other party had approached silently.

The people in the room, compared to that person, might not possess high cultivation, but since they could sit in this room today, none were simple characters.

Thus, they all knew who the visitor was.

The young female cultivator from Chunlu Garden’s Zhaonye Cottage named Qingqing steadied her mind, unwilling to see her admired man in trouble, and stood up to open the door.

Wei Bai sighed, already rising first, signaling the young woman not to act impulsively. He personally went to open the door, bowing politely as he said, “Iron Ship Court’s Wei Bai, paying respects to the sword immortal.”

The white-clothed scholar, holding a folding fan, smiled as he stepped across the threshold, “There’s no need for such formality, Wei Gongzi. We meet without prior acquaintance, after all.”

Hearing this, the people in the room trembled. When Wei Bai had stood to welcome him, they had all risen in unison, and besides the old lady from the Iron Ship Court and the young female cultivator from Chunlu Garden, everyone had intentionally or unintentionally stepped back a few paces from the table, holding their breath and bracing themselves as if facing a great enemy.

Wei Bai wanted to gently close the door.

However, once the white-clothed scholar crossed the threshold, the door closed automatically.

Wei Bai drew back his hand and walked towards the table alongside the scholar.

In this moment, he unexpectedly felt relieved. That feeling of having a knife pressed against the tip of one’s heart yet remaining unmoved was the most uncomfortable.

The white-clothed scholar sat down, pinching a teacup that was still upside down, pouring himself a cup of tea, “The village tea from the second-floor rooms has a better flavor.”

After Wei Bai sat down, the old lady stood behind him, while only the young female cultivator from Chunlu Garden sat down next to Wei Bai.

The white-clothed scholar casually pointed to a person, “Please trouble yourself to call in the ferry manager.”

That person hurriedly bowed, repeatedly saying he wouldn’t dare, and immediately left to summon him.

As the door gently closed, an unbearable silence fell in the room.

After a while, the white-clothed scholar smiled, “On this trip back and forth, I happened to see a senior leaving the ferry and walking in the mountain fields below.”

Wei Bai understood and sighed in relief, “If Master Liao could have a pleasant spar with the senior sword immortal, perhaps upon returning to the Iron Ship Court, he might break through his bottleneck and advance further.”

That young female cultivator from Zhaonye Cottage, perhaps the last to grasp the intricacies of the conversation in the room, looked at the others, who only slightly understood the nuances of the dialogue after Wei Bai.

The others, besides Wei Bai, took a bit longer to comprehend the underlying meaning of this exchange.

The sword immortal didn’t seem to know why he had given the Wei family a way out, yet at the same time, it felt like an invisible deterrent, another form of pressure.

I’ve killed your Golden Body Realm martial artist, and I still come to your home for tea. Do you, Wei Bai and the Iron Ship Court, want to settle this with me?

Yet at the same time, if the Iron Ship Court wished to smooth things over, it could also represent a different scenario. But in the end, it was still the Iron Ship Court that was in a difficult position, at least for now; as for the future, who knew?

Wei Bai chose to take the opportunity presented to him, swallowing his pride and completely accepting the other party’s subtle advances.

Then a gentle knock on the door sounded.

The person led the ferry manager into the room.

The old lady raised an eyebrow.

Wow.

So this young sword immortal had predicted this.

It turned out this conversation was meant for the young master to hear, as well as for the ferry side.

As long as the young master was willing to smooth things over, the previous harsh words from the young sword immortal would now carry a hint of goodwill.

After all, the Iron Ship Court making a fuss over its Golden Body Realm, which had actually not been killed but merely defeated, would only become a laughingstock. However, if the ferry side helped explain, it would be more palatable for the Iron Ship Court. Of course, the young master could also take the initiative to find this ferry manager to suggest something; the other party would certainly be willing to do a favor for the Iron Ship Court. But then again, this would make the young master’s situation even more complicated.

Small matters are still small matters, but if the young master could see the bigger picture through this, he might grasp a third layer of meaning.

In a fight, your raised Golden Body Realm martial artist is merely a matter of my punch. As for your courtly affairs, I’m also familiar with them. Given Wei Bai’s face, can you really afford to tear your face with me, an outsider sword immortal?

The Iron Ship Court might not fear a sword cultivator who only knows how to fight.

In North Julu Prefecture, as long as you have money, you can invite Golden Core sword immortals down from the mountain to “practice swordsmanship.” If you have enough money, you can even hire Nascent Soul sword immortals!

But.

The young sword immortal who liked wearing two robes had a sharp mind.

The old lady was from a demonic path background; she saw no distinction between good and bad, only strength and weakness. And strength could be divided into two categories: one that was inherently untouchable and the other that could be provoked but was best left alone. The former was naturally stronger, but the latter could become the former at any moment, sometimes even more difficult to deal with.

Ultimately, the Iron Ship Court was still a secular force beneath the mountain, extremely familiar with the rules of the government. The more so, dealing with those swift and decisive mountain cultivators, especially the straightforward ones, was actually not hard. The difficulty lay with those scheming clerical immortal masters.

The three great noble families of the Great View Dynasty, including the Wei family, were precisely because of their illustrious lineage that they had fewer seeds of scholars and martial generals. Were there not enough? There were plenty. Many noble offspring who were out of place in the capital fared reasonably well, but once they were sent out as officials, becoming a city’s assistant or a county magistrate, those sly old foxes in the officialdom would manipulate them without mercy, using every subtlety and malice imaginable, playing them around in circles while slowly draining them dry. 

Thus, for these years, the Iron Ship Court had spared no effort in protecting Wei Bai, even causing some rumors of tension, fearing that one day the young master might suddenly die, leaving no enemies to be found.

However, every time the young master ventured out, it was often the safest. With fixed routes, accompanying guards, and celestial support, they had even drawn out many deeply hidden hostile forces, following the clues to eliminate numerous hidden dangers from the government, the mountains, and the rivers.

But this time was truly a tremendous accident.

Currently, the ferry was still within the borders of a vassal state of the Great View Dynasty, yet the other party didn’t even give face to the Iron Ship Court and Chunlu Garden. Before that person made a move, with so much whispering, even if they hadn’t known the young master’s status earlier, they should have understood by now.

The white-clothed scholar pointed at the table with his folding fan, “Ferry manager, we’ve done business together before. Why so formal? Have a seat, drink tea.”

The white-clothed scholar casually waved his fan, and the teacup slid to the ferry manager’s side of the table, half of it hanging off the edge, slightly swaying, about to fall. Then, he picked up the teapot, and the manager stepped forward, hands grasping the teacup, bending down to present it. Once the white-clothed sword immortal poured the tea, he finally sat down. Throughout the entire exchange, no flattery or unnecessary words were spoken.

It was still early summer, yet this ferry was already filled with troubles.

The so-called two trades were one for paying to ride the ferry and the other for the sale of reports.

The white-clothed scholar lifted the teacup, leisurely taking a sip, gently placing it on the table, leaning back in his chair as he opened the folding fan, creating a refreshing breeze.

Wei Bai then followed suit, lifting his cup to drink. The ferry manager, after Wei Bai, also slowly raised his teacup to his lips, then held the cup with both hands, not setting it down.

The white-clothed scholar smiled, “There were some misunderstandings; once clarified, it’s fine. Out here, being amicable brings wealth.”

Wei Bai filled his cup again, adjusting it. One hand held the cup, the other supporting it lightly, smiling as he nodded, “Senior sword immortal, it’s rare for you to travel through the mountains and waters. This time, our Iron Ship Court has offended you; I’ll take this tea as a toast and dare to self-punish a cup?”

The white-clothed scholar nodded.

Wei Bai drank it all in one go.

The ferry manager felt tiny beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

As an Observation Sea Realm cultivator, he felt like he was sitting on needles.

The white-clothed scholar turned to the young female cultivator, “May I ask who this fairy is?”

Wei Bai put down his teacup, smiling, “This is the only daughter of Master Tang from Chunlu Garden’s Zhaonye Cottage, Tang Qingqing.”

The white-clothed scholar smiled, “Fairy Tang was the first one to want to open the door to welcome guests, right? Such a beautiful person, Wei Gongzi, you must not let her down.”

Wei Bai nodded with a smile, “I’m just waiting for both of our elders to give the nod.”

The white-clothed scholar hummed, smiling brightly, “Though I reckon the Zhaonye Cottage side will find it easier to agree, a son-in-law like Wei Gongzi is appealing to everyone. It’s just that General Wei’s approval may be a bit difficult, after all, there are some differences between the mountain and the valley. But of course, it all depends on fate; forcing a match is not good, and a twisted melon is not sweet.”

Wei Bai exhaled in relief.

Even Tang Qingqing looked a bit grateful.

The others standing in the room, those cultivators from various families friendly with the Iron Ship Court or Chunlu Garden, looked a bit confused. 

Besides that initial moment, when they felt an ominous air, now it seemed like they were just chatting casually?

The white-clothed scholar suddenly said, “Fairy Tang, you must know Song Lanqiao, right?”

Tang Qingqing quickly replied, “Of course, Master Song is my father's senior brother, all of whom are cultivators of the Lan character lineage from Chunlu Garden.”

The white-clothed scholar smiled, “That’s great. I took a ferry with Master Song before, and we hit it off quite well; we share a friendship across the ages. It seems I’ll have to bother Zhaonye Cottage when I head to Chunlu Garden.”

Tang Qingqing smiled sweetly, “Senior sword immortal’s visit to the cottage is our honor.”

Even Wei Bai felt somewhat envious of Tang Qingqing’s good fortune.

The white-clothed scholar suddenly asked, “Wei Gongzi, that young sword immortal who flew past earlier said something out of context. What’s his name?”

Wei Bai replied, “If I’m not mistaken, he should be the junior uncle from the Golden Crow Palace, Liu Zhiqing, the Liu Sword Immortal.”

Tang Qingqing nodded with a smile, “This Liu Sword Immortal from Golden Crow Palace visits Chunlu Garden every few years to draw water from a spring he purchased in his youth for tea.”

The white-clothed scholar exclaimed, “I saw that in the book ‘Spring Dew in Winter’ from Chunlu Garden. So this great sword immortal is Liu Zhiqing from Golden Crow Palace; I’ve long admired him. If I had known earlier, I would have shamelessly greeted him; when I go to Chunlu Garden, it’d be good for me to earn some reputation.”

Wei Bai maintained his usual smile.

The old lady, however, twitched her lips slightly.

The cup of village tea she hadn’t dared to finish was not bitter, but the ferry manager felt sorrowful. 

This sword immortal, you just killed someone from the Golden Crow Palace, and Liu Zhiqing still wants to invite you for tea. Do you really need this bit of fame? Can we just be a bit more straightforward and ask the sword immortal for a clear answer, so you stop torturing people?

The white-clothed scholar turned his head, “This old lady seems to think I’m not qualified to drink tea with Liu Sword Immortal?”

The old lady feigned a smile, “Not at all. For two sword immortals to sit by the spring under the mountain, that’s a splendid tale. The little booklet from Chunlu Garden can be reprinted this year.”

The white-clothed scholar maintained his smiling expression as he turned.

The old lady’s face grew increasingly stiff.

The white-clothed scholar suddenly narrowed his eyes, “I’ve heard that in the lower realms, there’s a saying: a disgrace to the ruler means death for the minister.”

The old lady’s face tightened.

The white-clothed scholar continued, “Regarding good tales, I’ve also heard of one from the Great View Dynasty. Once, when Wei Gongzi admired the snow on the lake, he saw a handsome young man crossing a bridge, accompanied by a lovely maid who smiled quietly. Wei Gongzi then asked whether she would be willing to become a celestial couple with that young man, saying that a gentleman ought to fulfill the beauty of others. The maid remained silent for a moment, then an old woman swept across the lake, presenting a gift to the young man. May I ask this old lady, what was in that box? I’m from a poor place and am curious about what precious item could so deeply move a young man.”

The old lady had prepared for the worst.

It would just take a fierce battle, dragging the young master of the Iron Ship Court and the young Tang Qingqing down with her. At that point, she would see how this young sword immortal would drink tea with Liu Zhiqing!

But the white-clothed scholar had already turned away, “No wonder the temple here is so prosperous.”

Wei Bai’s body tensed, forcing a smile, “May I have made Senior Sword Immortal laugh?”

The white-clothed scholar slowly rose. In the end, he simply patted the ferry manager’s shoulder with his folding fan and brushed past him, whispering, “Let’s not engage in a third deal. Walking too much down a night road makes you easy to see.”

Tang Qingqing was momentarily stunned.

Isn’t it easier to see ghosts?

The white-clothed scholar walked directly towards the door, raising his arm and shaking the folding fan in his hand, “No need to see me off.”

The door still opened on its own and then closed behind him.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 603: Meeting Cui Dongshan (Part Two)

Wei Bai couldn't help but smile wryly. 

"Do ghosts see people when they walk at night?"

After a long silence, Wei Bai roughly determined that the person could go back and forth on the ferry. He smiled at the old woman and said, "Don't mind it. There are high-level figures on the mountain, free of all restrictions—something we can only envy."

The old woman nodded with a smile.

Inside, however, Wei Bai scoffed coldly. 

Whether or not you truly don't mind is none of my concern. But I do mind! 

Just now, the hint of murderous intent that your old aunt let slip was directed at that young sword immortal, but I’m not a fool! 

Whether a dog bites a person or a person hits a dog, nothing compares to the ferocity of a dog fiercely biting another dog.

After returning to his room, the scholar in white began practicing his six-step stance. He suddenly stopped, walked over to the window, and with the night falling, lightly leaped onto the ship's railing, walking slowly. 

He walked like this all night.

As the sun rose over the sea, Chen Ping'an stopped at the bow of the ship, gazing out into the distance. Clad in a snow-white robe, he bathed in the morning glow like a golden deity descended from heaven.

In the evening, at the entrance of a shop on Dragon Riding Alley in Longquan County, a little girl as dark as coal sat on a small stool. Inside, Shi Rou occasionally glanced at the commotion outside. 

Pei Qian would often sit at the doorway, munching on sunflower seeds. Shi Rou knew she was missing her master.

After Chen Ping'an traveled from the Niu Jiao Mountain ferry to North Julu Island, Zhu Lian had been keeping an eye on the school for about a week. Finally, Pei Qian had gotten used to her studies there and no longer thought about sneaking out to skip class.

But even so, things didn’t settle down. Once, Zhu Lian visited the school to inquire about the situation with the teachers. The result was a mix of joy and worry. The joy was that Pei Qian hadn’t gotten into fights or even argued with anyone. The worry was that the teachers were quite helpless with her. The little girl showed no respect for the sage's texts at all. During class, she sat attentively by the window, silently doodling little figures on the corners of each page. After class, she would flip through her books, and an old teacher, not knowing where he got the information, checked all of Pei Qian's books, finding that indeed, not a single page was spared. The little figures were roughly drawn—just a circle for a head and five small branches for the body and limbs. Once the book was closed, a flip would reveal a scene resembling a celestial painting, with either the figures boxing or practicing swordplay.

The old teacher was at once amused and exasperated, and he didn’t immediately lose his temper. Instead, he began asking Pei Qian about her lessons, requesting her to recite passages from the texts. To his surprise, the little girl could recite them word for word. The old teacher relented, only reminding her not to scribble on the sage’s texts. Later, the little girl somehow acquired some books from outside the school, and her academic performance remained mediocre, though she continued to doodle diligently.

After class, she would occasionally go under a tree and catch an ant, bringing it back to place on a small piece of white rice paper. With one arm blocking the table, she would hold a brush in one hand and draw lines to block the ant's escape route, filling a whole sheet with a maze, leaving the poor ant wandering helplessly inside.

Due to the instructions given by Young Master Chen from the Chen family in Longwei Creek, all the teachers were told to treat Pei Qian like an ordinary child from Longquan County. So the other students only knew this little coal girl lived in a shop on Dragon Riding Alley and rarely spoke unless answering the teachers’ questions. Every day, she would go to school in the morning and return in the evening, preferring the stairs along Dragon Riding Alley and often walking sideways. In short, she was a particularly odd little character, making it difficult for her classmates to get close to her.

With time, some rumors spread around the school. They said this little coal girl was a money-loving child who helped with business at the New Year’s shop every day. She was probably an orphan, mingling around with the old shopkeeper inside.

There were also children who swore they had seen this little coal girl challenging the big white goose in the neighborhood. Others nearby claimed that every morning on her way to school, Pei Qian would deliberately imitate a rooster, causing a ruckus. Some even said that after bullying the big white goose, she would fight with the big rooster at the northern edge of the town, shouting things like "Take this, a spinning kick!" or squatting down to punch the rooster, wondering if she had lost her mind.

After Zhu Lian visited the school once, he returned to the shop and had a chat with Pei Qian. Finally, she stopped doodling little figures in her books or building houses for ants on rice paper.

Instead, after school, she would go to a secluded corner near Dragon Riding Alley, mixing mud with water, and alone, she would mold little clay figures, arranging them to fight. She fashioned three or four dozen little clay soldiers, and after each battle, she would sound a trumpet, carefully hiding the little figures nearby.

Shi Rou saw this and discussed it with Zhu Lian in private. Zhu Lian said there was no need to interfere.

However, two subsequent incidents caught Zhu Lian’s attention. The first was one day after Pei Qian finished copying texts, she excitedly ran off to play general on the battlefield, only to return shortly after.

When Shi Rou asked, Pei Qian looked dejected, standing on a stool behind the counter, resting her head on it. She said that recently, a heavy rain had caused the soldiers in her army to perish.

This made Shi Rou quite worried. With Pei Qian’s cleverness, how could she let her belongings get ruined by the rain? But Zhu Lian still insisted on letting her be.

The second incident, however, made Zhu Lian frown. After receiving news from Shi Rou, he hurried from the Fallen Star Mountain to Dragon Riding Alley.

Shi Rou told him that one day after school, Pei Qian had dragged the neck of a dead white goose back to the shop and buried it somewhere unknown.

At that moment, Pei Qian was alone in her room, copying texts.

Zhu Lian stood at the shop’s entrance, and Shi Rou said Pei Qian didn’t want to say anything, and she had to find out the information herself.

On her way back from school, Pei Qian was confronted by a woman from the market who accused her of having killed her white goose, hurling a barrage of insults. Pei Qian initially denied it, but the woman became aggressive. After dodging, Pei Qian simply insisted it wasn't her doing. In the end, she took out her stash of pocket money, offering the woman the two small silver coins and all her copper coins, saying she could buy the dead white goose, but she hadn’t killed it.

Shi Rou was anxious and asked Zhu Lian what to do, wondering if they should have a heart-to-heart talk with Pei Qian.

Zhu Lian, with his back to the counter and facing the road of Dragon Riding Alley, said talking was fine, but it wouldn’t work. Pei Qian had her own temperament, and Shi Rou knew that all too well.

Shi Rou then suggested that she would talk to the woman and, using some means, find out which troublesome kids from the school were involved so that both sides could apologize to Pei Qian.

To her surprise, the usually jovial Zhu Lian cursed, saying it was useless. “What’s the point? It’s just how things are.”

This frightened Shi Rou, leaving her pale.

In the end, Zhu Lian stood at the door for a long while, quietly returning to Fallen Star Mountain without doing anything.

After that, Pei Qian showed no signs of trouble, obediently attending classes at the school, going out and coming back on time, and whenever she had free time, she would help with the shop's business, copy texts, practice her crazy sword techniques. However, this reassurance made Shi Rou even more uneasy.

Shi Rou would rather Pei Qian had slapped that woman from the market or argued with one of the old teachers at school.

But Pei Qian did none of that.

At that moment, Shi Rou realized that it wasn’t just about whether Chen Ping'an was at Fallen Star Mountain; it was like having two Fallen Star Mountains. 

And whether he was beside Pei Qian was akin to having two Pei Qians.

Fortunately, Pei Qian still sat at the entrance of the shop, munching on sunflower seeds, talking to herself about who knows what, occasionally looking towards the end of the alley.

At this time, Pei Qian seemed familiar to Shi Rou.

That day, after Pei Qian had just taken her stool back to the shop’s courtyard, intending to practice her nearly perfected crazy sword techniques, she suddenly heard the old cook shouting from the front of the shop, “Pei Qian! Pei Qian, get out here!”

With her walking stick in hand, Pei Qian rushed out angrily, “Old cook, are you looking for a beating?!”

When she reached the front of the shop, she saw a little girl with crossed arms standing at the threshold, her face taut as she locked eyes with Pei Qian.

Pei Qian was taken aback for a moment and said seriously, “Who is this? Your long-lost illegitimate daughter? Finally found her?”

Zhu Lian cursed, “Get lost,” and patted the little girl’s head, saying, “This is Zhou Milin, sent by your master from North Julu Island.”

Pei Qian clapped her hands and said with sparkling eyes, “Master is impressive! Not only can he pick up money but also little girls!”

The girl in black furrowed her brow, tilting her head as she squinted at the little coal girl, who was not too tall.

Pei Qian widened her eyes, smiling and saying, “How about I treat you to boiled fish tonight?”

After speaking, she held one hand like a knife and the other like a cutting board, moving her hand rapidly up and down, creating a dizzying display while making chopping sounds with her mouth. After finishing, she took a deep breath and said solemnly, “This knife technique of mine ranks second in the world, only slightly inferior to my master’s!”

Then she spread her hands, “Have you ever seen a fish this big? Or a crab this big?”

Zhou Milin immediately dropped her crossed arms, her face scrunching up in sweat as her eyes darted around anxiously.

Shi Rou smiled. "Truly a little fish monster."

Zhou Milin, suddenly inspired, awkwardly spoke in the Da Li dialect, “Your master asked me to pass a message. He said he misses you very much.”

Pei Qian's eyes lit up instantly. The girl in black quickly jumped down from the threshold, a bit frightened.

Pei Qian picked up the walking stick resting against her shoulder and walked confidently over to the threshold, looking at the girl in black with an expression of... kindness. She reached out to pat her head and smiled, “Not very tall, just a little winter melon grown for hundreds of years. It’s okay, it’s okay, I won’t look down on you. I, Pei Qian, as my master’s first disciple, am not the type to judge by appearance!”

Zhou Milin, despite her clumsy Da Li, could understand everything.

Zhu Lian chuckled, “From now on, Zhou Milin will be entrusted to you. This is the young master’s intention. How do you say? If you’re unwilling, I’ll take Zhou Milin back to Fallen Star Mountain.”

Pei Qian smirked, glancing sideways at the old cook, “Of course, in this vast world, my master is the greatest. From now on, I’ll take good care of this little winter melon. I’ll feed her plenty…”

Zhou Milin immediately shouted, “As long as it’s not fish, anything is fine!”

Pei Qian smiled, rubbing the little girl’s head, “Such a good girl.”

Zhu Lian left.

Shi Rou leaned on the counter, chuckling to herself.

After that, the shop on Dragon Riding Alley gained a little girl in black.

And that dog would often come by, waiting at the entrance for Pei Qian to return from school around the time classes were ending.

One day, Pei Qian rushed out and saw Zhou Milin holding a walking stick and the dirt dog lying on the ground. Pei Qian squatted down, grabbing the dog's mouth and twisting it, “Tell me, did anyone bully the little winter melon today?”

The dog, which had already become quite sharp-witted, felt like it was going to die.

What should I say?

Pei Qian flicked her wrist, twisting the dog’s head to another direction, “Not saying?! Trying to rebel?!”

Zhou Milin timidly said, “Senior Sister, no one bullied me anymore.”

Pei Qian nodded, releasing her grip and giving the dog a light slap on the head, “How are you doing your job as the left protector of Dragon Riding Alley? If you keep slacking off like this, you’ll be useless, and there’ll only be a right protector left!”

Zhou Milin immediately stood up straight, tiptoeing, clutching the walking stick tightly.

They ran through the streets, back to Dragon Riding Alley, and as they dashed down the steps, a figure in white descended from the sky, sleeves fluttering impressively. With a stance like a golden rooster standing alone, one arm crossed in front of him and two fingers pointing skyward, he declared, “If you want to pass from here, leave behind your toll!”

The dirt dog tucked its tail and ran away.

Zhou Milin felt a bit anxious, tugging at Pei Qian’s sleeve, “Senior Sister, who is that? So fierce.”

She didn’t think the person was a particularly powerful villain, just that he seemed a bit off in the head, tall, and if he relied on his strength to strike, he could hurt her or Senior Sister, and there would be no way to reason with him.

But she saw Pei Qian’s serious expression. Pei Qian said slowly, “He’s a notorious villain in the martial world, exceptionally tricky. I don’t know how many top masters have fallen to him. I might have a hard time dealing with him. Just stand behind me; don’t worry, this Dragon Riding Alley is under my protection. Let me take his head!”

Zhou Milin nodded vigorously, wiping her forehead of sweat and taking a step back.

Then she watched as Pei Qian jumped down, landing right next to the man in white, swinging her walking stick outward.

Zhou Milin’s eyes widened; what’s going on? This swing was rather slow, slower than an ant moving its nest.

The man in white leisurely leaned back, raising his two white sleeves slowly, like two pieces of slowly unfurling rice paper.

Just in time, he avoided Pei Qian's swing.

Then, back and forth they went, still slow enough to scare someone. A swing here, a lift of a foot there; Zhou Milin felt she could almost run the length of Dragon Riding Alley.

Zhou Milin was about to scrunch her brows together; she truly didn’t understand what was happening.

In the end, Pei Qian and the handsome, slightly off-kilter man in white almost simultaneously withdrew, both making a deep breathing motion.

Pei Qian remarked, “A master! Able to withstand my six styles of crazy sword technique, more than enough to conquer the martial world.”

The man in white nodded, “Indeed.”

Zhou Milin was a bit confused, scratching her head.

The man in white then smiled brightly and said, “You must be Zhou Milin. I’m Cui Dongshan; you can call me your little senior brother.”

Zhou Milin quickly got up, rushing down the steps, stretching her neck to look at the person who introduced himself as Cui Dongshan, “Chen Ping'an said you bully people; I don’t think so!”

Cui Dongshan waved his sleeve, holding up his fingers delicately, covering his face and said “shyly," “My master is the best at joking!”

Zhou Milin’s mouth twitched as she turned to Pei Qian.

Pei Qian kicked Cui Dongshan on the calf, “Act serious; don’t embarrass my master!”

Cui Dongshan cleared his throat a couple of times, squatted down, and smiled, “Just stand up straight.”

Zhou Milin blinked.

The man extended a finger, lightly pressing it against her forehead.

Zhou Milin felt a bit dizzy, as if she was becoming sleepy.

She didn’t know how long had passed when a sudden sharp pain shot through her forehead, and then everything went back to normal.

The man stood up, gently patting Zhou Milin’s head, smiling, “It’s all good now. Let’s go; let’s head back to the shop together.”

Pei Qian frowned, “You must be careful; this is something my master entrusted you with!”

Cui Dongshan casually placed his hands behind his back, standing sideways with the two girls, his expression resigned, “I know, I know. Let’s go, let’s go.”

At the front of Dragon Riding Alley, the two little girls walked confidently, their strides bold.

This was called swaggering down the road, while the demons were anxious.

Pei Qian really took good care of Zhou Milin, even pulling out a talisman she had kept, spitting on it, and slapping it on Zhou Milin’s forehead.

Cui Dongshan followed behind the two little girls, walking leisurely, smiling at them.

The brilliance of the sun and moon.

The light of Milin.

Then Cui Dongshan raised his hand gently, pinching between his fingers a pitch-black remnant of a soul.

Cui Dongshan smirked, “Sorry, but encountering me, Cui Dongshan, is truly your bad luck.”

At the Chunlu Pu ferry, Song Lanqiao, in charge of the sect’s ferry, received a message via flying sword from Tang Qingqing in the ancestral hall. The Nascent Soul Ancestor and the ancestral hall decided unanimously to temporarily relieve him of his duties at the ferry, allowing him to stay at Chunlu Pu and personally welcome the young sword immortal from the Bone Marsh until the Farewell Spring Feast ended. If that young sword immortal surnamed Chen wanted to stay on to enjoy the scenery afterward, it would naturally be even better.

Song Lanqiao had been waiting at the ferry for nearly an hour, yet he was in good spirits, greeting familiar faces with genuine smiles.

The ferry managers around the world were all unfortunate souls on the path of cultivation, not discarded disciples of the sect but rather people like Song Lanqiao. Apart from his master, most of the elders and guest elders of the ancestral hall, despite having realms equivalent to his, simply regarded him with disdain. Though many were just one level higher than him—merely changing the character “lan” in their names to “zhu”—they truly didn’t treat him well. First, they were of different lineages, and second, the income from the ferry throughout the year, along with the exotic flowers, rare woods, and divine money from the Jia Mu Mountain range, never passed through his hands. A trusted inner disciple from the ancestral hall would be responsible for connecting with various immortal forces. He merely collected a bit of leftover profit as the ferry owner, and in the case of any mishaps, the ancestral hall would hold him accountable, which was not exactly a lamentable situation; he just never had many peaceful days.

A ferry slowly docked, and the bustling Chunlu Pu symbol water ferry became the center of attention. Ferries big and small from all over North Julu Island noticed something odd.

None of the passengers on that ferry descended using wind manipulation or jumped down; without exception, they all stepped off the ferry using their own two legs. Moreover, once they disembarked, each one looked as if they had narrowly escaped death.

Chen Ping'an stepped off the ferry, followed by Wei Bai from the Iron Armor Mansion and Tang Qingqing, but they were several dozen steps apart.

Upon seeing the increasingly lively Song Lanqiao, Chen Ping'an was led by this Jin Dan to a scenic spot in Jia Mu Mountain range, where there were guest houses specifically for entertaining distinguished guests, with ancient-style buildings nestled in the bamboo forest.

The two boarded a talisman boat heading to their residence. The bamboo forest stretched endlessly, lush and vibrant, filled with abundant spiritual energy, refreshing the mind and spirit.

The “boatman” of the talisman boat was a young woman. Onboard, equipped with a complete tea set, she knelt at one end of the boat, skillfully preparing tea.

While enjoying tea and the scenery, Song Lanqiao introduced the various buildings, shops, peaks, caves, and scenic spots along the way.

The Jia Mu Mountain range was vast, and it took nearly half an hour for the talisman boat to reach the bamboo forest, and after about a quarter of an hour, it stopped next to a pavilion nestled among the bamboo at the mountain’s peak.

This time, when Chen Ping'an appeared, he no longer carried the bamboo box or wore a straw hat. Whether he held the walking stick or not, even his sword was sheathed, leaving him in a white robe, holding a jade bamboo fan, looking elegant and charming.

The young female boatman from Chunlu Pu, who had some aptitude for cultivation but not a high level, stood beside the boat, smiling brightly. However, throughout the journey, apart from serving tea and refilling cups, she said nothing.

As Chen Ping'an approached, he pinched a snowflake coin between two fingers. The girl seemed a bit surprised, hesitated for a moment, then quickly extended her hand. Chen Ping'an released his fingers, letting the coin fall lightly into her palm, and then he thanked her.

Seeing the girl looking a bit uneasy, Song Lanqiao laughed, “Just accept it. The strict rules from elsewhere don’t apply here in the bamboo forest.”

As Chen Ping'an and Song Lanqiao walked towards the residence, Chen Ping'an curiously asked, “Senior Song, did I break the rules of Chunlu Pu’s mountain gate?”

Song Lanqiao shook his head with a smile, “The guest houses in other areas of the Jia Mu Mountain range do have rules that restrict boatmen from receiving tips from guests, but here in the bamboo forest, it’s relaxed. If Chen Gongzi is willing, even giving a small summer coin is acceptable, and it will definitely all go to the boatman. Chunlu Pu won’t take a single cent.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “Doing things just to impress isn’t me.”

The Farewell Spring Feast would be held three days later.

Just before the summer solstice.

Moreover, Song Lanqiao mentioned that after summer, there would be a Deer Antler Feast, though it wouldn’t be as grand as the earlier market. So now, there were always more ferry trips going out than coming back, especially since Chunlu Pu valued spring.

The two walked slowly along the bamboo forest path.

Then they arrived at a tranquil residence hanging the plaque “Jing Zhi,” with three courtyards.

Chunlu Pu had six residences named after the six solar terms of spring, with three of them located in this bamboo forest. However, the “Qing Ming” residence was generally not preferred by guests due to its somewhat unlucky name. Yet those Daoist masters visiting Chunlu Pu often chose to stay in this house. In fact, each time around the Farewell Spring Feast, deciding who should be assigned to these six residences would become a headache for the Chunlu Pu ancestral hall. Deciding whom to give it to could easily lead to resentment.

There was even a “Li Chun” residence, the most prestigious, which had just been vacated by a Nascent Soul guest. Although it was highly sought after, it wasn’t out of the question to let that young sword immortal occupy it. However, after discussion in the ancestral hall, they felt this residence was too close to the Yuying Cliff, where that young master from the Golden Crow Palace was staying to draw water and make tea, which would be inappropriate. In case a real conflict arose, good intentions could turn to misfortune.

While deliberating on this matter, a group of originally arrogant elders and guests from the sect solemnly asked Song Lanqiao for his opinion.

This made Song Lanqiao feel a bit of pride, but being an old Jin Dan, he did not show a hint of arrogance; instead, he became even more respectful, handling everything flawlessly.

In the mountains, it was essential to maintain a steady flow.

Today’s good fortune could turn to misfortune tomorrow; there were far too many examples.

After entering the Jing Zhi residence, Song Lanqiao didn’t linger long and soon took his leave.

Inside the house were two young female cultivators of remarkable appearance, one of whom was actually a direct disciple of a Chunlu Pu Jin Dan cultivator. 

They were tasked with temporarily serving the guests.

This made Chen Ping'an quite uncomfortable. When he saw Song Lanqiao to the door, he directly asked if he could dismiss the two girls.

Song Lanqiao chuckled, “Chen Gongzi, you are our Chunlu Pu's foremost esteemed guest, of course, you can do that. However, those two girls will surely face consequences later.”

Chen Ping'an sighed, shaking his folding fan, and said no more.

Song Lanqiao quietly said, “Our old ancestor originally planned to personally welcome you, but due to some unexpected events with the Farewell Spring Feast, she had to handle it herself. Our old ancestor is meticulous; she truly cannot leave, so I can only offer my apologies to you, Chen Gongzi.”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “You’re too polite about the old ancestor.”

After Song Lanqiao left, once his figure disappeared at the end of the bamboo forest path, Chen Ping'an didn’t immediately return to the residence but began wandering around.

When he returned to the residence, he saw Liu Zhiqing from the Golden Crow Palace standing at the door, looking youthful, with a golden hairpin in his hair, appearing like a jade tree swaying in the wind.

The two young female cultivators stood by, their gazes soft—more than just admiration from female cultivators towards a sword immortal; there were also the glances of women admiring handsome men.

Chen Ping'an smiled.

People just can't compare to people; it could drive one mad.

If his student were standing here, it was likely that these two Chunlu Pu female cultivators would have no eyes for Liu Jianxian at all.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 604: Master Bao Fu Zhai

Liu Zhiqing asked, "Shall we go to Jade Blossom Cliff (Yuyingya) for tea?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head and chuckled, "It seems that Sword Immortal Liu has some misunderstanding about me. I dare not go to Jade Blossom Cliff for tea, fearing that it might come with a penalty drink."

Liu Zhiqing replied, "My fondness for the spring water at Jade Blossom Cliff far surpasses that of the Thundercloud Palace."

Chen Ping'an understood, "That's good. Shall we walk there, or travel on the wind?"

Liu Zhiqing smiled, "It's up to you."

Chen Ping'an turned to the female cultivator of the Spring Dew Courtyard, a direct disciple of the Golden Core, "Could you please summon a talisman boat to take us there?"

The beautiful woman had no objections. Accompanying Sword Immortal Liu on a journey to Jade Blossom Cliff was a rare honor. Moreover, this esteemed guest from the Jing Zhe Mansion was also a top-tier guest of the Spring Dew Courtyard. Although only the distant Golden Core uncle, Song Lanqiao, had come to greet him, it couldn't compare to the grand entrance Liu had when he first entered the mountains. However, since he could stay here, he was certainly no ordinary person.

Jade Blossom Cliff was not located within the Bamboo Sea. The Grandmaster Hall of the Spring Dew Courtyard had purposefully arranged this to prevent any conflicts between the two sword immortals.

The talisman boat soared into the sky, and beneath their feet, the bamboo forest stretched out like a verdant sea of clouds. The mountain breeze swept through, causing the bamboo to sway rhythmically, a sight to behold.

This time, the female cultivator did not brew tea for her guests. It would have been a misstep in front of Sword Immortal Liu, a display that would only invite laughter.

Upon reaching the small dock at Jade Blossom Cliff, after disembarking, Chen Ping'an curiously asked, "Doesn't Sword Immortal Liu know the customs here?"

Liu Zhiqing raised an eyebrow, "What customs?"

Chen Ping'an explained, "When a fairy drives the boat, the guests are expected to reward her with a small summer coin as a token of thanks."

The female cultivator from the Jing Zhe Mansion looked bewildered.

Liu Zhiqing, however, exclaimed, tossing out a small summer coin, which chimed as it landed softly in front of her. "I was rude before."

Liu Zhiqing began to walk forward slowly, "If we continue for about a thousand steps, we will reach the bamboo tube spring."

Chen Ping'an looked around and asked, "I've heard that the entire Jade Blossom Cliff has been purchased by Sword Immortal Liu and the Spring Dew Courtyard?"

Liu Zhiqing nodded, "Five Grain Rain coins for a five-hundred-year term. It has already been over two hundred years."

Chen Ping'an turned to her and said, "You can return first, Fairy. I'll find my way back to the Bamboo Sea on my own later."

The young female cultivator nodded, hesitated for a moment, but chose not to speak, fearing she would disturb the two esteemed guests. She planned to return and discuss the peculiar summer coin with her master before deciding whether to accept it.

The talisman boat, crafted by the Taizhen Palace at great expense, had an elegant and ancient design. As it passed through regions rich in spiritual energy, beautiful verses and poems would appear on the walls of the boat. If a guest happened upon a phrase they liked, they could pluck the words as easily as cupping water in their hands, placing them onto the fan or book pages, where they would remain forever, exuding an ancient charm.

The Spring Dew Courtyard was always pleased when guests took words from the talisman boat.

Earlier, Song Lanqiao had introduced this aspect, but at that time, Chen Ping'an felt shy about it. Now, with Liu Zhiqing accompanying him, he took the opportunity to extract two phrases, inscribing them onto one side of his folding fan, a total of ten characters: "Spiritual texts hidden in the cave of heaven, residing in the suspended Jade Capital."

Walking alongside Liu Zhiqing on the stone-paved path towards the spring, Chen Ping'an opened his fan and gently waved it, causing the ten characters to ripple like aquatic plants in water.

Liu Zhiqing softly said, "We're here."

At the edge of Jade Blossom Cliff stood a thatched pavilion, with a thatched cottage enclosed by a fence not far away.

Inside the pavilion, there were tea sets arranged on a table, and below the cliff lay a crystal-clear pool, devoid of fish, its bottom adorned only with glimmering pebbles.

After taking a seat, Chen Ping'an faced the young Golden Crow Palace elder and closed his fan, smiling, "Let's skip the tea. Sword Immortal Liu, what brings you to me?"

Liu Zhiqing laughed, "If you don't drink, I still intend to."

Liu Zhiqing traced the characters "True Fire" on the table. The golden light of the talisman flowed, and soon the strokes converged into a single line, transforming into two red fire serpents that coiled and twined on the table. Liu Zhiqing lightly waved her sleeve, and several pounds of spring water from the pool flew towards the table, coalescing into a sphere. She then placed a celadon tea cup nearby, and the spring water began to boil. Moments later, Liu Zhiqing pinched a few tea leaves from the jar and gently tossed them into the cup, giving a light flick, and the boiling spring water flowed like a slender stream into the celadon cup, filling it to just the right amount.

Liu Zhiqing lifted her cup and slowly sipped.

Chen Ping'an said, "Make one for me too."

Liu Zhiqing smiled and took another cup, pouring tea for Chen Ping'an as well, then gently sliding it across to him.

After taking a sip, Chen Ping'an nodded, "Sword Immortal Liu is the second-best tea brewer I've met outside the world."

The best, of course, was still Lu Tai.

Liu Zhiqing smiled, "If the opportunity arises, Young Master Chen, you should bring that expert to sit here at Jade Blossom Cliff."

Chen Ping'an set his cup down and asked, "Back at the Golden Crow Palace, although Sword Immortal Liu did not show himself, you must have had some insights. Why didn’t you stop my sword?"

Liu Zhiqing sighed, putting down the cup that was already raised to her lips, lightly resting it on the table. "What good would it have done? Just a senseless fight?"

Liu Zhiqing shook her head, "That would be pointless. Since I entered the Golden Core stage, all these years, relying on my name, Liu Zhiqing, how many wrongs have the sword cultivators of the Golden Crow Palace committed while traveling down the mountain? It's just too bad I'm not adept at managing affairs, so I find the Thundercloud Palace bothersome, I dislike seeing my junior's Dao partner, and I can't stand the arrogant juniors like Jin Le. All I can do is pretend not to see and not to care."

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Having such a different mindset from the Golden Crow Palace cultivators is precisely why Sword Immortal Liu can reach the Golden Core stage, standing above others. However, it’s also likely the reason behind your bottleneck in breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage. Coming here for tea might relieve your worries, but it won't necessarily aid your Dao cultivation."

Hearing this, Liu Zhiqing smiled again, taking a sip of tea before saying, "Earlier in the Huangfeng Valley of Baoxiang Country, you should have seen my sword strike. Among the many Golden Core sword cultivators in the southern region of North Julu, my strength is not insignificant."

Chen Ping'an recalled the last sword strike in Huangfeng Valley, where the sword light descended from the heavens, injuring the foundation of the Yellow Robed Ancestor. After confirming that the Golden Crow Palace's sword cultivators had left, it still attempted to feast on human flesh and souls to replenish its demon core.

Liu Zhiqing continued, "But a sword can be double-edged, leading to great trouble. I have always pursued the principle of 'a sword once drawn does not return.' Thus, honing the sword's edge and tempering the Dao heart was quite smooth when my realm was low. The higher I go, the more troubled it becomes. Other than escorting the younger generation of the Golden Crow Palace down the mountain to practice their swords and coming here for tea, I rarely leave the mountain anymore. As for breaking through, my hopes are dwindling."

This involved the great Dao of others, and Chen Ping'an fell silent, merely sipping tea. The tea's essence was rich; for Liu Zhiqing, whose key energy channels were as vast as rivers and lakes, this bit of spiritual energy was trivial. But for Chen Ping'an, a practitioner at the "Lower Five Realms," each cup of tea was a timely rain for a parched field—more was always better.

Liu Zhiqing asked seriously, "So, when I invite you for tea, I wish to ask about that sword you extended outside the Golden Crow Palace. What was your intent for drawing it, how did you do it, and how could it be... that the heart and sword were both unimpeded? Please share what can be said beyond the Dao, as it may serve as a stone from another mountain to polish my jade. Even if only a trace of enlightenment, it would be worth its weight in gold for my current bottleneck."

Chen Ping'an raised his cup and smiled, "If I were to share my insights and you were to gain a few understandings, and you, Sword Immortal Liu, deem it invaluable, then would you simply reward me with a cup of tea?"

Liu Zhiqing smiled, "You claim to want another cup of tea, but aside from the spiritual energy from the tea, you merely wish to uncover my unique talisman and energy manipulation techniques. Does that count as repayment?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "For now, I haven’t grasped the true essence of a Golden Core sword cultivator’s talisman techniques, and if it’s not meant to be understood, then so be it."

Liu Zhiqing laughed heartily, raising her hand to point at the clear pond and the steep cliff beside them, "If I gain something, I will transfer the remaining three hundred years of Jade Blossom Cliff to you. How about that? You can either keep it for hosting and brewing tea, or lease it to the Spring Dew Courtyard or anyone else, whatever you prefer."

Chen Ping'an snapped his fan open and waved it gently, "Then I shall trouble Sword Immortal Liu for another cup of tea. Let us take our time drinking and chatting. In business, it's essential to establish mutual trust first; then everything else will be easy to negotiate."

Liu Zhiqing smiled knowingly. From that point on, one spoke with rippling words of insight, while the other wielded martial techniques that gathered sound into lines, beginning their "business."

After a stick of incense had burned away, the man once again reached out for a cup of tea. Liu Zhiqing put on a serious face, "Could you show a bit of sincerity, good sir?"

Chen Ping'an replied earnestly, "Every word I say is sincere!"

Liu Zhiqing waved her sleeve, "No further farewells."

Chen Ping'an pondered for a moment, then waved his fan with one hand while the other swept over the bubbling spiritual spring on the table, drawing forth a few drops of spring water. He then used these as endpoints to draw a straight line, gently tapping one end with his fingertip and slowly sweeping to the right until he stopped at the other end, "If we don’t look at the grand scheme, but focus on the immediate surroundings and certain individuals, if this line represents the small world of Sword Immortal Liu, then you, Liu Zhiqing, are a practitioner born and raised in the Golden Crow Palace, with your heart and nature rooted here. The customs and feelings of the Golden Crow Palace, and the hearts of the sword cultivators, are here, and continuously shift away from your own nature. More sword cultivators, like the hot-tempered lady master of the palace or the arrogant Jin Le, gather on the far end. While you cultivate in the Golden Crow Palace, you will feel that everything is an eyesore. However, your realm is high enough, and your status greater, allowing you to guard your true heart, but you will reach a standstill. Since your focus is on sword practice, aiming high, you wish to sharpen your sword with the help of earth immortals, but you are too lazy to deal with the trivial matters right under your nose, deeming them a waste of time. Is that correct?"

Liu Zhiqing lightly nodded, sitting upright with a serious demeanor, "Indeed."

Chen Ping'an raised his hand again, pointing to the endpoint that symbolized Liu Zhiqing's nature, suddenly asking, "When it comes to drawing your sword, why seek far when you can find it near? Those who excel at defeating others are held in high regard by those below the mountains, while it seems those above the mountains tend to value self-mastery more. Sword cultivators wield immense power, praised as the best in the world—so is there still a need for self-reflection and self-cultivation? Do the flying swords and the wielders of those swords need to be entirely pure and unblemished in both heart and mind?"

Chen Ping'an lowered his hand, gently drawing vertical lines from the horizontal line on the table, "You, Liu Zhiqing, can you draw your sword along this trajectory until your sword heart becomes clear?"

Liu Zhiqing fell into contemplation.

Chen Ping'an suddenly asked again, "Did Sword Immortal Liu grow up on the mountain, or did you ascend to cultivate there in your youth?"

Liu Zhiqing gazed at the line, softly replying, "I can remember only being on Golden Crow Mountain, following my master in cultivation, completely ignoring the mundane world."

Chen Ping'an sighed, standing, "Then I'll assume I said nothing. I can only suggest that Sword Immortal Liu venture down the mountain more often and travel widely."

Liu Zhiqing raised a hand, gesturing lightly, "Though I am not skilled in mundane matters, I dare not say I fully understand the human heart, but I do have some knowledge. So, spare me your attempts to use those Jianghu tricks to deceive me. This Jade Blossom Cliff, which has been half gifted to me, is clearly something you wish to acquire. If you were to sell it, after three hundred years, I'd wager you could easily double the five Grain Rain coins, if not more, if managed well—ten coins would not be out of reach."

The man promptly sat back down, smiling, "Doing business with a wise person is always straightforward."

Liu Zhiqing raised her head, curiously asking, "Are you that concerned about wealth? Why bother?"

The white-clad scholar sighed, "It's tough for a mountain hermit to make money."

Liu Zhiqing shook her head, too lazy to engage in this man's nonsense.

After a moment of silence, Liu Zhiqing spoke, "Are you suggesting using the customs and feelings of the Golden Crow Palace as a ground for sword sharpening?"

The white-clad scholar smiled, "Every grain of rice yields various interpretations. Sword Immortal Liu, you are wise; you will figure it out."

Liu Zhiqing looked at the straight line, murmuring to herself, "Regardless of the outcome, just the thought of using this for sword sharpening is already greatly beneficial."

Liu Zhiqing raised her head, saying, "As agreed, this Jade Blossom Cliff is now yours. Keep the land deed safe; I’ll go speak to the Grandmaster of the Spring Dew Courtyard later."

A deed of land, already worth a fortune, floated down in front of Chen Ping'an. Both parties affixed their seals; the Spring Dew Courtyard's seal was a spring character from the ancient script of the Grandmaster's seal, while Liu Zhiqing's was a character resembling a sword. Even after two hundred years, it still carried the essence of a sword.

Chen Ping'an did not immediately put away the deed, which was worth at least six Grain Rain coins. He smiled and asked, "Sword Immortal Liu, such a generous offer! I think that thought may not actually be of much benefit; it could even lead to misfortune. I am a person who values fairness in business, never deceiving the young or old, and I certainly wouldn’t dare to swindle a sword immortal with immense killing power. Please, return the deed to me. As long as I can come here to drink tea without paying, that would suffice."

With a clear mind, Liu Zhiqing replied, "After leaving Jade Blossom Cliff, if you truly return to the Golden Crow Palace, your approach to sharpening your sword with various human sentiments will naturally not be this same mindset. So take the deed."

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment, then used his fan to draw vertical lines from the horizontal one on the table, "The lady master of the Golden Crow Palace, the wife of that great mountain lord, Jin Le, and the female cultivator who advised Jin Le against striking at me—all of them have their respective backgrounds, lineage, cultivation milestones, experiences down the mountain, allies, principles, and their own grievances... Are you truly interested in knowing, Sword Immortal Liu? If you choose to sharpen your sword, you must point directly to your true heart. As a Golden Core sword cultivator at the bottleneck, your life sword, your cultivation level, and your seniority in your sect may well be your greatest enemies. Can you truly set them aside? If you fail to proceed with determination to the other side, it will only harm your true heart and cause your sword heart to become tainted, your sword intent flawed."

Liu Zhiqing smiled, "I can assure you that you are no sword cultivator. The hardships endured in practice and the trials of fortitude are yet to be fully grasped by you. Washing swords in the Golden Crow Palace is difficult due to the trivial matters that are as numerous as cattle hairs, and it's also challenging because of the unpredictable nature of human hearts. But ultimately, it parallels the initial challenge of refining the sword embryo—both must be executed with utmost precision, possessing a similar essence. I am merely taking another journey down the path of my early cultivation. I managed it back then; why would it be hard now, having become a Golden Core sword cultivator?"

The white-clad scholar shook his head with a smile, "The same thing, but with the passage of time, becomes two different challenges."

Liu Zhiqing pondered for a moment, nodding with a smile, "I see."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "Am I pretending to be profound, and you truly believe me? Are you not afraid I might lead you to the mountain's foot and into the water ditch?"

Liu Zhiqing stood up, "I won’t trouble you further. I hope to have the opportunity to come here for tea as a guest in the future, as the host remains the same."

In Liu Zhiqing's eyes, this Jade Blossom Cliff was now her guest's territory.

Chen Ping'an glanced at the deed on the table and then looked up at the white-clad youth, "How did the Golden Crow Palace end up with someone like you as a sword cultivator? Did your ancestors accumulate virtue?"

Liu Zhiqing laughed, "That sounds harsh, but I'll take it as a compliment. Honestly, it’s not boasting; the reputation of the senior practitioners of the Golden Crow Palace was indeed much better in earlier years than it is now. It’s just a pity that reputation does not translate into cultivation and family heritage; such is the helplessness of worldly affairs. Therefore, I often think that the actions of that junior are merely misaligned with their own desires, not necessarily wrong."

Chen Ping'an stood up, "Shall we make another deal?"

Liu Zhiqing asked, "What do you mean by that?"

Chen Ping'an first posed a question, "Do the cultivators of the Spring Dew Courtyard spy on this place?"

Liu Zhiqing pointed towards the thatched cottage outside the pavilion, "Do you think my sword is just for show? Some rules must still be observed. For instance, when I drink tea here, I strictly adhere to the Spring Dew Courtyard's customs. Previously, if I encountered a Golden Crow Palace enemy in the Jiamu Mountain Range, I would simply turn a blind eye. Therefore, if the Spring Dew Courtyard doesn't adhere to these simple rules, it would be tantamount to inviting me to draw my sword—a path to death."

"That would be best."

Chen Ping'an pointed to himself, "You are not troubled by the fact that you cannot find a sharpening stone?"

Liu Zhiqing looked around, "Are you not afraid that Jade Blossom Cliff might be ruined in an instant? The spring water and the cliff are now yours."

Chen Ping'an replied, "Choose a place, draw boundaries, and we can spar. You wield your sword, and I’ll use my fists. How does that sound?"

Liu Zhiqing laughed, "I fear you might die."

"That's a wish that’s hard to fulfill."

Chen Ping'an closed his fan and reiterated, "A wish that’s hard to fulfill."

A single sentence with two meanings.

 ### Chapter 605: The Student Who Crafts Porcelain Figures

At the Farewell Spring Banquet, the renowned sword immortal Liu Zhiqing from the Golden Crow Palace had yet to make an appearance. The young sword immortal residing in the Jing Zhi Mansion also remained absent. This left many in the bustling Chunlu Garden feeling regretful, as rumors swirled about everywhere.

Liu Zhiqing was no stranger to anyone. As one of the top cultivators along the southeastern coast of North Julu Prefecture, he may have only reached the Golden Core stage, but his youth and prowess as a sword cultivator were well recognized. After the death of the previous palace master, a Nascent Soul sword cultivator, the prestigious title of the Golden Crow Palace had been upheld almost single-handedly by Liu Zhiqing and his sword.

Despite Liu Zhiqing's notoriety, most of the locals and visiting cultivators in Chunlu Garden were more interested in the tales surrounding the young sword immortal from afar. There were three main stories that captured everyone’s attention: 

First, it was said that he had cleaved through the protective thunderclouds of the Golden Crow Palace with a single sword strike, a claim that Liu Zhiqing himself had confirmed. He even invited this young man to enjoy tea at Jade Reflection Cliff.

Second, according to rumors circulating around the ferry, this individual had honed his physique to an extraordinary level using an innate sword embryo, rivaling even a Gold Body martial artist. One punch from him had sent a master from Iron Ship Manor tumbling from the ferry, supposedly leaving him with only half a life after the fall. The young master Wei Bai from Iron Ship Manor did not deny this and, without hesitation, confirmed the account. Tang Qingqing from the Nightwatch Pavilion openly stated that this young sword immortal had deep ties to Chunlu Garden, being an old acquaintance of both his father and the ferry's owner, Song Lanqiao.

Third, the sword immortal surnamed Chen, residing at the Bamboo Sea Jing Zhi Mansion, was rumored to make daily trips between the Bamboo Sea and Jade Reflection Cliff. The nature of his relationship with Liu Zhiqing was left to speculation.

Meanwhile, a secret meeting was convened at the Ancestor Hall of Chunlu Garden, where discussions led to the decision that certain exaggerated rumors could circulate freely. However, there was a deliberate effort to obscure the true whereabouts and identity of the young sword immortal from Chen, as well as the specifics of the earlier ferry incident. As a result, a web of intrigue began to weave throughout the Jiamu Mountain Range, with rumors sprouting up daily—one day claiming he had checked into Gu Yu Mansion, the next saying he had moved to Li Chun Mansion, and another suggesting he was at the Nightwatch Pavilion enjoying tea. Many cultivators who sought to catch a glimpse of the sword immortal left disappointed.

After the Farewell Spring Banquet concluded, more ferries departed from Fushui Ferry, and cultivators made their way back to their homes. Among them was Song Lanqiao, a Golden Core cultivator from Chunlu Garden, who boarded a ferry that had just made a round trip to the Bone Marsh.

However, on Old Huai Street within the Jiamu Mountain Range, a small shop had quietly opened under new management. The new shopkeeper was a young man dressed in a blue robe, casually sitting on a small bamboo chair out front, a vermilion wine jug hanging at his waist and a folding fan in hand. He didn’t bother to shout for business, simply enjoying the sun, inviting those interested to come in.

Old Huai Street was bustling with trade, and the small shop, no bigger than a palm, paid a hefty annual rent to Chunlu Garden—a substantial sum in celestial coins. The shop, adorned with a sign reading "Ant" (蚍蜉), was filled with a hodgepodge of items from the mountains, neatly arranged in display cases. On the counter lay a slip of rice paper, cut into strips, emblazoned with the words "No Negotiation on Prices," anchored down by two small stamps. Each display case also had a sheet of paper detailing the items for sale and their prices.

The shop was divided into an inner and outer section, but the back door was firmly closed, with a notice posted: "Treasure of the Shop, for the Fortunate." In large, bold characters, it invited those lucky enough to find it. If one looked closely, they'd see additional small notes in fine script suggesting, "The highest bidder wins."

Given its prime location, the shop's prices were not to be underestimated, and the quality of goods was guaranteed. After all, a new shop would typically showcase some valuable items to attract customers, and established shops in Old Huai Street often displayed a few treasures for admiration. However, this "Ant" shop felt rather modest, with only a few notable items from the Bone Marsh, such as a collection of white jade bones, and a complete set of paintings depicting divine maidens from the Wall City—decent, but lacking that truly memorable celestial treasure. More prominently displayed were various trinkets and baubles, with two entire display cases filled with items resembling those from a wealthy young lady's boudoir.

As time passed, the clientele shifted almost entirely to women who had come to check it out. Young female cultivators from various sects and noble ladies from the Grand View Dynasty flocked to the shop, perusing its offerings. If they found something to their liking, they would simply call out at the entrance. Should they inquire whether the young shopkeeper could lower the price, the fellow would merely wave his hand dismissively. No matter how charmingly the women pleaded, it was futile; the young shopkeeper remained steadfast, refusing to offer any discounts.

Many women, accustomed to spending freely yet irritated by the refusal to negotiate even a copper coin, would leave in frustration. The young shopkeeper would only smile in welcome as they departed, never making an effort to change their minds.

Thus, the shop gained a reputation for being unyielding in its pricing.

Unexpectedly, one evening, Tang Qingqing entered the shop with a group of female cultivators closely associated with the Nightwatch Pavilion, creating quite a stir. Each of them picked up an item that caught their eye without attempting to haggle, leaving behind celestial coins as they exited. They spent their entire time in the Ant shop, buying everything they wanted before skipping the rest of the street.

Following their visit, business improved somewhat. However, the real surge came when Liu Zhiqing, the sword immortal known for his striking appearance, made his way into the shop, spending liberally. For reasons unknown, he left with a collection of bones from the Bone Marsh.

On the day the shop closed, the young shopkeeper, with no assistant or accountant to help, was alone at the counter, counting celestial coins. Snowflake coins piled high, along with several small summer coins.

A young man in white, with a hairpin, stepped over the threshold and approached the shopkeeper, shaking his head in bemusement. "I can’t understand why you’re so keen on making money."

Chen Ping'an didn’t even look up, "I told you before, Liu the Great Sword Immortal, we’re just rootless drifters in the mountains. We must rely on our wits to make a living; you cultivators with your lineage wouldn’t understand."

Liu Zhiqing shook his head. "I need to go; I’ve already spoken with Old Ancestor Tan about the matter at Jade Reflection Cliff. But I still hope you won't sell it off or rent it to anyone else. If not, I might not come back to Chunlu Garden for tea anymore."

Chen Ping'an looked up and smiled, "But that’s six Gu Yu coins! I can’t stay permanently in Chunlu Garden. I can always find a Chunlu cultivator to manage the Ant shop for me and split the profits. I still can make some money. But if you're not going to sell or rent Jade Reflection Cliff, what am I supposed to do with the deed? Just let it gather dust for three hundred years?"

Liu Zhiqing sighed.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Actually, it’s easy to come back to Chunlu Garden for tea. Just give me three Gu Yu coins, and for the next three hundred years, you’re free to come anytime. Before I leave, I’ll inform Chunlu Garden, and no one will stop you."

Liu Zhiqing asked, "Do you think my Gu Yu coins just fall from the sky?"

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "Just joking. You can come for tea whenever you want."

Liu Zhiqing stood still.

Chen Ping'an looked puzzled. "What’s wrong? Am I supposed to pay you to come for tea? That would be ridiculous!"

Liu Zhiqing, now irritated, retorted, "What happened to all those pebbles from the bottom of the clear pool? They’re worth only two or three hundred snowflake coins. Are you really that greedy?!"

Chen Ping'an slammed the table, "The deed is in my hands! The entire Jade Reflection Cliff is my property. If I want to take a few broken stones with me, what business is it of yours?!"

Liu Zhiqing helplessly suggested, "Then let’s say I’m buying those pebbles from you to put back under Jade Reflection Cliff. How about that?"

Chen Ping'an extended a hand, "Five small summer coins. This shop doesn’t offer discounts!"

Liu Zhiqing slapped the counter, and after a moment, five small summer coins appeared on the table. He turned to leave, "If I come back to Chunlu Garden and find even one pebble missing from the water, I swear I’ll cut you down!"

Chen Ping'an pressed a finger gently onto the counter to prevent the neatly arranged snowflake coins from toppling over. Another five small summer coins appeared, which was quite bothersome. 

Being too good at business didn’t always serve one well.

Chen Ping'an felt today was a fruitful day for commerce. He collected all the celestial coins and stepped out from behind the counter, hanging up the closed sign before settling back onto his small bamboo chair, now enjoying the cool evening air.

His sparring sessions with Liu Zhiqing had been competitive but not to the death; they were merely meant to gauge the speed of a Golden Core sword cultivator's flying sword. 

After three rounds of sparring, Liu Zhiqing had gone from exerting five percent effort to seven, and finally to nine. Chen Ping'an had a rough idea of what to expect.

However, Liu Zhiqing was understandably frustrated; after all, he had likely never faced such a challenging opponent before.

Of course, both Chen Ping'an and Liu Zhiqing had faced their own struggles during those three sparring sessions, and a fourth round was unnecessary. It would only lead to a life-or-death confrontation, which neither desired.

As for why Chen Ping'an remained in Chunlu Garden after their sparring, aside from making some money as a temporary shopkeeper, he was also awaiting a reply.

Earlier, he had sent a secret letter via the Chunlu Garden Sword Hall to the Pi Ma Sect’s Mu Yishan. This so-called secret letter, even if intercepted by a flying sword, contained nothing but mundane matters for the young Pi Ma Sect disciple, Pang Lanxi, to relay to Longquan County.

Thus, the timing of when the letter would reach Bone Marsh and Chunlu Garden depended entirely on when Old Ancestor Tan would make an appearance.

This Nascent Soul ancestor, who managed thousands of cultivators and subordinates within Chunlu Garden, had yet to reveal herself to Chen Ping'an. However, if Mu Yishan from the Pi Ma Sect truly responded, no matter how composed she was or how busy her responsibilities, she would certainly come to visit either the shop or the Jing Zhi Mansion.

As night fell, Old Huai Street was aglow with lights.

The Ant shop saw a bit more incoming business.

Just as Chen Ping'an stood up to close the shop and prepared to summon a small talisman boat borrowed for the journey, intending to ride the winds back to the Bamboo Sea Jing Zhi Mansion, he paused when a slender young woman suddenly appeared, smiling as she stood before him.

Chen Ping'an stepped over the threshold, clasping his fists in greeting. "Greetings, Madam Tan."

The owner of Chunlu Garden, Tan Ling, was her name. In Chunlu Garden, besides her, the direct disciples of the Ancestor Hall all had three-character names, such as the Golden Core Song Lanqiao.

Tan Ling didn’t linger long. After exchanging pleasantries, she handed Chen Ping'an a sword box belonging to the Pi Ma Sect’s Ancestor Hall before smiling and taking her leave.

Chunlu Garden's business no longer needed to take risks for greater rewards.

With the establishment of the small shop on Old Huai Street and the subsequent acquisition of a talisman flying boat, the timing was just right.

Chen Ping'an closed the shop and took the talisman boat to the Bamboo Sea Mansion. Inside his room, he opened the sword box to find two flying swords. The letter from the Pi Ma Sect contained a message stating that it was a gift from the Mu Yishan Ancestor Hall to Young Master Chen, with two flying swords capable of traveling up to a hundred thousand miles, difficult for a Nascent Soul cultivator to intercept.

Chen Ping'an was no stranger to sword boxes; he had one of his own, though the one from Shujian Lake was far inferior in quality compared to this one.

Sitting in the room, he opened a letter. Upon seeing the handwriting, a smile crept onto his face. 

His eldest disciple had penned a lengthy missive, detailing her diligent studies in the school, the challenges she faced, and how she persevered with utmost seriousness, even moving her teachers to tears.

Some truly confidential matters were likely handled by Cui Dongshan directly.

For instance, she mentioned in a veiled way the matter concerning Zhou Mili, stating in the letter, "The student is already aware. There’s nothing to worry about." 

Chen Ping'an read through it several times.

Well, Pei Qian’s handwriting had become increasingly neat. It seemed she hadn’t been slacking off on her studies after all.

As for her remarks like, "Master, my mad magic swordplay has reached perfection. It’s a pity you haven't come home to see me," and, "I’ve made a small fortune for the shop, you should come back and take a look. What if the silver runs away on its own and I can’t stop it?" or, "Though dozens of my soldiers have perished under my command, I’ve recruited two powerful guardians. In Riding Dragon Alley, not a single household has lost anything," or, "Master, you can rest assured. The short winter melon in the shop is quite obedient, just a bit of a glutton, but I have to use my own savings to cover her food expenses. I’ve mastered unparalleled swordplay, saber techniques, and fist techniques. Even if someone bullies me, I won’t hold it against them. But I will definitely protect that short winter melon, as she is the weak one Master mentioned. I am no longer weak…"

Chen Ping'an chuckled as he folded the family letter and carefully tucked it away.

Now, he had long since removed his golden robes and snowflake garments, wearing only a simple blue robe with his wine jug.

He rose and stepped out onto the corridor, gazing far beyond the high walls of the courtyard. The Bamboo Sea was lush and verdant, vibrant with life.

---

After Cui Dongshan hurried back to Longquan County, he had dinner at the Riding Dragon Alley shop. The main seat at the table remained empty, and even after playfully tussling with Pei Qian, he could only sit opposite her. The small water monster, Zhou Mili, sat beside Pei Qian, while Shi Rou always took a seat with her back to the door, needing no sustenance. In the past, she would chat with Pei Qian, but today, she dared not miss the meal.

During the dinner, Shi Rou merely picked at her food for form’s sake, while the other three devoured it with gusto. Zhou Mili, in particular, ate swiftly.

Afterward, Cui Dongshan left Riding Dragon Alley, claiming he was off to the Desolate Mountain for a drink.

Pei Qian paid him no mind as she practiced the difficult mad magic swordplay in the courtyard, with Zhou Mili clapping enthusiastically beside her.

Instead of heading directly to the bamboo loft at Desolate Mountain, Cui Dongshan appeared at the foot of the mountain, where a respectable residence now stood. In the courtyard, Wei Ban, Zhu Lian, and a hunchbacked man were playing chess. Wei Ban and Zhu Lian were engaged in a match, while Zheng Dafeng was munching on sunflower seeds, offering commentary.

Cui Dongshan perched on the wall, watching for a while before he couldn’t help but scold, "Three terrible chess players gathered together, it’s blinding to my eyes!"

When he descended, as soon as he sat down, Wei Ban and Zhu Lian returned their pieces to the jar. Cui Dongshan stretched out his hands. "Don’t! Youngsters need to have their fun with chess."

Zheng Dafeng began to shoo him away.

Wei Ban went straight back to Pi Yun Mountain.

Zhu Lian and Cui Dongshan climbed the mountain together.

Cui Dongshan flapped his sleeves like a hen flapping its wings, bouncing up a couple of steps at a time.

Casually, Cui Dongshan asked, "Has Jiang Shangzhen been to Desolate Mountain?"

Zhu Lian laughed, "You mean Zhou Fei’s brother? Yes, he came by, saying he wanted to serve as our Desolate Mountain’s guest elder with his Nascent Soul cultivation."

Cui Dongshan scoffed, "Did you agree?"

Zhu Lian, hands behind his back, turned with a smile, "Guess."

Cui Dongshan waved his sleeves, "Oh, Zhu Lian, you have made progress!"

Zhu Lian replied with a smile, "Don’t flatter me. As for the rest, it’s up to chance."

Cui Dongshan hovered in the air, just a foot off the ground, casting a sidelong glance at Zhu Lian. "Jiang Shangzhen is no simple character, and Xun Yuan is even more so."

Zhu Lian smiled, "That’s why I declined. This guy is not good at flattery and still needs to train hard before he can join Desolate Mountain. Zhou Fei thinks so too; he said he would go back and study hard before coming to seek my guidance next time."

Cui Dongshan finally landed, flapping his "wings" as he ascended slowly. "What about the Jade Purity sword cultivator, Li Cai?"

Zhu Lian replied, "Zhou Fei is quite talented, but I feel he lacks something. Perhaps that’s his shortcoming. He’s not good at flattery, whether with women or otherwise. That Li Cai couldn’t stand Zhou Fei’s gaze and wanted to draw his sword. I couldn’t stop it, so the bamboo loft lady had to… throw a half-punch. Zhou Fei managed to talk him down."

Cui Dongshan’s expression darkened.

Now that he was responsible for southern affairs, he was not as clear on what was happening in the north.

Zhu Lian chuckled, "The family is large and the business is growing. Welcoming and sending off guests from all walks of life is normal."

Cui Dongshan sneered, "Isn’t it your fault for being lacking in skill and not mastering your punches?"

Zhu Lian sighed, "I’m trying my best to control my intent even when I’m just taking a piss. What else can I do?"

Cui Dongshan landed and began walking up the mountain, casually saying, "Lu Baixiang has started to expand his territory."

Zhu Lian, hands behind his back, climbed the mountain with a cheeky grin. "He’s just like Wei Xian, traveling far and wide to eat meat while others get the scraps."

Cui Dongshan suddenly stopped, "I won’t go up the mountain. You tell Wei Ban to send a message via flying sword to that Mu Yishan from the Pi Ma Sect, asking for the birthday, hometown, lineage, and burial place of that Gao Cheng. Anything you can find out will do; the more information, the better. Even if the entire Pi Ma Sect turns out useless, it’s fine. But make sure Wei Ban conveys a heartfelt message to them—there’s no such thing as easy money in this world."

Zhu Lian asked, "Why didn’t you mention it when Wei Ban was right in front of you?"

Cui Dongshan laughed, "You go say it; that way, you owe them a favor."

Zhu Lian nodded, "That makes sense."

Cui Dongshan stopped climbing and transformed into a streak of light back to the small town.

Now that Ruan the Blacksmith was not in Longquan County, he was free to come and go as he pleased.

Cui Dongshan made a trip to the heavily guarded Old Porcelain Mountain, leaving with a large sack. 

Afterward, he stayed a few days at an ancestral home he once visited, doing who knows what each day. Even when Pei Qian came by, Cui Dongshan didn’t answer the door.

Pei Qian, along with Zhou Mili, climbed up to the roof intending to lift the tiles. Upon reaching the top, they discovered a skylight, but looking down, it was misty, and they couldn’t see anything.

They had no choice but to return to Riding Dragon Alley.

One day, Cui Dongshan swaggered into the shop just as Pei Qian and Zhou Mili came rushing down the steps.

In the courtyard, while Pei Qian practiced the increasingly difficult mad magic swordplay, she asked, "Is someone planning to bully the short winter melon again? What should we do?"

Cui Dongshan chuckled, "If you can avoid them, do so. What else can be done? It’s pointless to argue; are we supposed to beat them to death?"

Pei Qian paused her practice, and Zhou Mili quickly fetched a small stool for her. Once Pei Qian sat down, Zhou Mili squatted beside her, lightly clattering her teeth, playing around.

Pei Qian laid her staff horizontally, frowning, "What’s wrong with those old teachers? Can’t they teach anything beyond just rote learning? Anyone can memorize lines…"

At this moment, Pei Qian raised her chin, "Right Guardian! You should step up now."

Zhou Mili seemed to understand perfectly, helping the elder sister express the remaining thoughts: "What’s the use!"

"Regardless of age or gender, there are always some annoying folks around."

Cui Dongshan laughed, "Those who can’t find satisfaction in their lives will naturally find fault with others. When life isn’t going well for them, they’ll be even more likely to see faults in others."

Pei Qian bristled, "Are you talking about me?"

Cui Dongshan clasped his hands behind his head, leaning back, his feet slightly elevated, swaying gently without falling, "How could I be talking about you? I’m just explaining why I wanted you to steer clear of these people. They’re like water ghosts, pulling people down."

While swinging back and forth, Cui Dongshan lifted a hand, pretending to hold a folding fan, gently moving his wrist.

Pei Qian asked, "Why do you like fans so much? Did you give one to Master?"

Cui Dongshan continued his movement, "I have a whole pile of fans, but I gave my favorite one to the Master."

Pei Qian whispered, "What were you doing in that house? You weren’t stealing or moving things, were you?"

Cui Dongshan closed his eyes and feigned sleep.

Pei Qian made a gesture, motioning for Zhou Mili to follow her quietly back into the house to copy texts.

Afterward, Cui Dongshan slipped away from Riding Dragon Alley and Longquan County. However, Pei Qian found it strange that the teachers from Chen’s academy in Longquan County, who usually kept a low profile, had begun visiting students' homes, traversing every street and alley, ensuring no household was overlooked. For instance, the old teacher who visited her shop in Riding Dragon Alley had spent quite a while chatting with Shi Rou before even sharing a meal. Moreover, the teachers, who traditionally only taught moral lessons and expounded on sacred texts, were now also helping with farm work, chopping wood, and taking students on excursions to the dragon kiln. 

Privately, it seemed some teachers were grumbling that such behavior tarnished their cultured image, yet they merely muttered a few complaints without taking action. Not long after, the academy quietly dismissed a few old teachers while bringing in several new faces.

A young man in white, walking southward, had long distanced himself from the Great Li Dynasty. On this day, he scooped water from a stream beside the mountains and looked at the moon reflected in his hands, smiling as he said, "Though I cannot keep the moon, I can still drink the water."

Then, with a flick of his sleeve, he produced a small porcelain figure about a foot tall, its body and limbs marred by countless cracks, and its face yet to be formed. Compared to the porcelain figure that had appeared in his old home years ago, this one simply required further refinement, and his skills had indeed improved.

Cui Dongshan turned to look, reaching out to gently stroke the little porcelain figure's head, smiling, "Isn’t that right, Brother Gao?"

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 606: Reflection

Chen Ping'an stepped out of the Insect Awakening Manor, holding a verdant walking stick that complemented the bamboo forest around him. Alone, he made his way to the edge of the bamboo grove. 

After a moment of hesitation, he summoned the small boat made of talismans and rode the wind towards Jade Reflection Cliff. During the period of the Spring Dew Garden, when borrowing the talisman boat, the maids at the manor joked that the expenses for the boat’s trips between the manor and Old Huai Street were all covered by a bag of divine coins prepared at the Insect Awakening Manor, which Chen Ping'an had never opened. Adapting to local customs and adhering to rules was one thing, but he also had his own principles. As long as the two did not conflict, he could leisurely navigate within those constraints, turning the rules into a vessel to explore the beautiful mountains and rivers.

As Chen Ping'an piloted the talisman boat crafted by the Taoist lineage of the Taizhen Palace and arrived at Jade Reflection Cliff, he noticed Liu Zhiqing, his junior from the Golden Crow Palace, had already removed his shoes, rolled up his sleeves and trousers, and was standing barefoot in the stream by the clear pool, bending down to pick up pebbles. Spotting a particularly nice one, he tossed it into the pool without even looking up. After Chen Ping'an landed and stored the talisman boat in his sleeve, Liu Zhiqing still did not lift his head, continuing downstream barefoot, and said curtly, "Shut up, I don’t want to hear you talk."

It was likely that this junior, a golden crow disciple, did not believe that the money-crazy Chen Ping'an would return hundreds of pebbles to the clear pool. As for the bigger reason, Liu Zhiqing was somewhat demanding about the act of returning the pebbles, insisting on perfection. He should have returned to the Golden Crow Palace long ago but, halfway, he felt that the pool was empty, which left him restless. Thus, he decided to return to Jade Reflection Cliff instead. After saying goodbye to the man surnamed Chen at the shop on Old Huai Street, he could not bear to urge the money-crazy Chen Ping'an to hurry up and return the pebbles, so Liu Zhiqing could only do it himself, believing that every additional pebble he collected was worthwhile. 

Chen Ping'an also took off his shoes and stepped into the stream, just as he picked up a lovely shiny pebble, wanting to help toss it into the clear pool.

Unexpectedly, Liu Zhiqing spoke again, "That one won’t do; the color is too bright."

Chen Ping'an still threw it towards the pool, but Liu Zhiqing waved his sleeve, knocking the pebble back into the stream, fuming, "Chen!"

"Alright, alright, good intentions treated as a donkey's liver and lungs. From now on, let’s mind our own business." 

Chen Ping'an reached down, retrieved the pebble, rubbed it clean with his hands, and smiled as he pocketed it. "All real gold and silver, indeed. A real treasure."

The clear pool beneath Jade Reflection Cliff had a unique spring water source, rich in spiritual energy, and the pebbles at the bottom had been polished by the clear spring for countless years, making them exquisite. The pebbles in the stream were slightly inferior but still excellent for carving seals or as decorative pieces resembling sheep fat jade. A bit of polishing and they could serve as top-notch items for the esteemed officials' writing desks. Having such items in a study would not only be visually pleasing but also uplift the spirit.

Liu Zhiqing carefully selected and tossed dozens of stream pebbles into the pool.

It felt more meticulous than choosing a daughter-in-law or a partner.

Chen Ping'an followed Liu Zhiqing, picking up the pebbles he discarded, and thus added another forty or fifty pebbles to his collection. He had already thought of the old store that specialized in writing supplies on Old Huai Street. He couldn’t afford to hire the shopkeeper, who might not even look twice at these pebbles. Instead, he would only need to find a couple of apprentices who had at least half the skill of the old shopkeeper. They would be more than capable of dealing with these pebbles, helping him carve them into either plain seals or decorative pieces or small inkstones. When he later displayed them at his own shop, he could claim they were products of the old pits at Jade Reflection Cliff and weave a plausible story about the Golden Crow Palace's Liu Sword Immortal and his enlightenment through stone. The prices would skyrocket.

As for the pebbles he retrieved from the bottom of the pool, he still needed to return them faithfully. If he wanted to run a long-term business, being shrewd was always secondary to honesty. After all, having a shop in the Spring Dew Garden already no longer felt like a burden to him. The reason the Spring Dew Garden's ancestral hall wanted to gift him a shop was simple: the old woman at the ferry boat had already revealed the secret. The book "Spring Dew, Winter Exists" indeed had to include a few notes about "Chen Sword Immortal." But when Song Lanqiao mentioned this matter, he clearly stated that the person writing for the Spring Dew Garden would, before Chen Ping'an left, show him the new version of "Spring Dew, Winter Exists" with those segments about him for his review to see what could be written and what could not. In fact, the Spring Dew Garden had long been prepared, having done business on the mountain for so many years, and was quite aware of the taboos of the immortal world.

Chen Ping'an was quite pleased with these profitable business strategies and felt no annoyance at all. He had chatted energetically with Song Lanqiao about this, after all, the future Falling Mountain could also serve as a practical reference.

Liu Zhiqing came ashore and walked towards Jade Reflection Cliff, observing that the guy still showed no signs of leaving the water, seemingly planning to scour the stream once more to avoid missing anything.

Liu Zhiqing laughed and said, "Brother Good Man, are you blinded by money?"

Chen Ping'an bent down to pick up a pebble that was as delicate as ink jade, gently flipping it over to see if it had any attractive natural patterns, and replied with a smile, "I grew up poor and learned to be cautious."

Liu Zhiqing had not left the Spring Dew Garden because he wanted to see this guy return hundreds of pebbles to their original place before he could feel at ease.

But now, Liu Zhiqing was starting to doubt whether this guy would immediately start collecting them again the moment he left, feeling that this crazy act was something that Chen would truly do.

Chen Ping'an stored the lovely ink jade-like pebble in his pocket, his gaze wandering, thinking that picking up money from the ground was much easier than earning it from others' pockets. If he didn’t bend down and reach for it, he feared he would be struck by lightning.

Because of Chen Ping'an, Liu Zhiqing spent a full half an hour returning to Jade Reflection Cliff.

When they reached the thatched pavilion, Chen Ping'an stood still, and Liu Zhiqing stared at him.

Chen Ping'an smacked his forehead, exclaiming about his poor memory. With a wave of his sleeve, hundreds of pebbles fell like rain into the clear pool. Liu Zhiqing focused intently on those stones, counting them roughly. The key point was that none of the ten or so pebbles he liked were missing, which made his expression soften. If even one had been lost, he felt he wouldn't come here for tea anymore. Whether Chen was a money-grubber or not was his own business; being able to earn from him was already a skill. But if he didn't keep his word, it would mean two entirely different things. If someone like Chen got hold of Jade Reflection Cliff, Liu Zhiqing would consider it ruined and would have no lingering feelings.

Chen Ping'an patted his sleeve and said, "Have you ever thought that picking up stones from the stream is also a form of cultivating the heart? I have a rough idea of your temperament; you strive for perfection. This mindset might help in sword cultivation, but when it comes to heart cultivation, with the Golden Crow Palace's mindset of cleansing the sword, you would probably find it quite distressing. So now I actually regret telling you those connections."

Liu Zhiqing shook his head, "The more troublesome it is, the more it indicates that once the sword cleansing is successful, the rewards will exceed my expectations."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Just finding an excuse to remind you."

Liu Zhiqing hesitated for a moment, took a seat, and began drawing runes with his fingers. This time, however, his movements were slow, and he didn’t deliberately conceal the ripples of his spiritual energy. Soon, two bright red fire serpents spiraled up, lifting and asking, "Have you learned?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "I remember the hand movements, and I can roughly see the trajectory of the spiritual energy flow, but I can't do it yet."

Liu Zhiqing frowned, "If you could devote half of the effort you put into business to your cultivation, would you be in such a bleak situation?"

Chen Ping'an smiled bitterly, "Liu Zhiqing, don’t sit here and talk as if you haven’t felt the pain. I’m someone whose Bridge of Eternal Life has been severed; being in my current situation is already quite fortunate."

After three previous sparring sessions, Chen Ping'an had a clear understanding of Liu Zhiqing's character. He had originally agreed to let Liu Zhiqing, this sword cultivator at the Golden Core bottleneck, use only fifty percent of his strength. He himself would only use his fists.

Chen Ping'an drew a circle with a radius of ten zhang and faced Liu Zhiqing's flying sword with his cultivation level from when he was in Old Dragon City.

During their first encounter, Liu Zhiqing underestimated Chen Ping'an's physical resilience and wasn't quite accustomed to his style of exchanging injuries, throwing a punch without yielding any. Therefore, the flying sword named "Waterfall" appeared for the first time. Although it was as swift as a waterfall cascading from the heavens, it merely pierced an inch above Chen Ping'an’s heart. As a result, Chen Ping'an allowed the flying sword to penetrate his shoulder and instantly arrived in front of Liu Zhiqing, who deftly dodged a few zhang away but was still hit by a punch that sent him sprawling outside the circle. Fortunately, the other party had intentionally held back after delivering the punch, but Liu Zhiqing still fell to the ground, sliding back several zhang, covered in dust.

Liu Zhiqing was merely a bit disheveled. After rising gracefully, he looked at the guy whose shoulder and ankle had indeed been pierced by the flying sword and asked, "Does it hurt?"

The fly sword's difficulty lay not only in its speed but also in the fact that once it penetrated the opponent's body, it was extremely hard to heal quickly and would leave a lingering effect akin to a "conflict of the Great Dao." Other offensive treasures could also cause lasting damage, but it was nothing compared to the sword energy's lingering effects. Once a sword penetrated, it created chaos in the spirit flow, greatly impacting the Qi running through the body. In a life-and-death struggle, even the slightest disruption in spiritual energy could be fatal, and generally, a practicing Qi cultivator’s physical training was simply not as strong as that of a warrior or sword cultivator. A sudden sharp pain could easily affect one's state of mind.

A single sword was already like this; how about being struck by several swords?

At that time, the other person laughed, "It doesn’t interfere with your punches."

In the second spar, Liu Zhiqing began to be cautious about the distance between them.

You see, sword cultivators, especially earth immortal sword cultivators, were adept at both long-range and close combat.

Chen Ping'an began to face Liu Zhiqing's flying sword with the cultivation he had after his arrival at the Bone Marsh, skillfully dodging Liu Zhiqing's elusive flying sword. 

After that round ended, both sat cross-legged outside the circle, Chen Ping'an covered in numerous minor injuries, and Liu Zhiqing equally dusty.

At that time, Chen Ping'an couldn’t help but ask, "I've faced a flying sword from an old golden core sword cultivator; how come you only used seventy percent of your strength and were still so fast?"

Liu Zhiqing was in a bad mood at the time, "It was only seventy percent, believe it or not."

On the third day, Liu Zhiqing looked at the guy who appeared unscathed and asked, "Isn’t this all just an act? Today, I’ll unleash ninety percent of my strength. Although we agreed not to fight to the death..."

Before Liu Zhiqing could finish, the other person smiled and said, "Just focus on your sword."

Chen Ping'an faced his opponent again, using the strength he had after withstanding the Heavenly Tribulation of the clouds, but without employing any of his most powerful punches.

In the end, Liu Zhiqing stood outside the circle, rubbing his swollen cheek with his hand and slowly dispersing the bruises with spiritual energy.

Chen Ping'an stood at the edge of the circle, his smile bright, sporting several bloody holes, which were not fatal wounds—just requiring some time to recover.

Liu Zhiqing had to ask the same question again, "Doesn’t it hurt?"

Chen Ping'an blinked, "Guess?"

After three bouts, they had become friends.

Chen Ping'an and Liu Zhiqing both understood this, but neither was willing to voice it.

Otherwise, with Liu Zhiqing's lofty demeanor, would he willingly support Chen Ping'an's little shop on Old Huai Street? Or walk down the street with a skeleton in tow, feeling awkward?

At this moment, the scene of the clear pool beneath Jade Reflection Cliff once again shimmered with brilliance, lost and regained, especially moving, which lifted Liu Zhiqing's spirits.

As for Chen Ping'an’s severed Bridge of Eternal Life, although Liu Zhiqing was shocked and curious about how it was rebuilt, he wouldn’t ask too much.

Liu Zhiqing dispersed the two red serpents he had conjured on the table and asked, "How’s the injury?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "It’s nothing. I can earn money while nursing my injuries on Old Huai Street."

Liu Zhiqing then asked, "You mentioned earlier that the foundational boxing manual came from the southeastern region of Bei Ju Luzhou, related to the story of the ant moving stones into water. Have you made any progress?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "I’ve been focused on making money, so I didn’t take many opportunities to chat, which is a bit regrettable."

Liu Zhiqing nodded, "Serves you right."

Chen Ping'an smiled helplessly.

Apart from the origins of that Mountain-Shaking Boxing manual, there was another matter—the tragedy of the intercontinental ferry that perished in the central region of the Baoping Continent years ago. However, there was no need for Chen Ping'an to inquire too much, as it was impossible to uncover anything; the mountain had long been sealed off by the immortals. The stack of mountain water newsletters bought by the little water monster on the ferry contained a few pieces of news about the Mountain-Shaking sect, but most were trivial rumors. Moreover, being an outsider, asking about the insider story of the Mountain-Shaking sect would inevitably lead to unforeseen consequences. Naturally, Chen Ping'an was cautious.

Thus, Chen Ping'an planned to head to the central region of Bei Ju Luzhou, intending to traverse the river that spanned the east and west of the continent.

He needed to be mindful of the Chongxuan Department's Yunxiao Palace from the Dayuan Dynasty.

That Yang Ningxing, aside from the "scholar" transformed from a grain of malice, was actually a very impressive cultivator.

However, the Chongxuan Department of the Dayuan Dynasty had a mixed reputation in Bei Ju Luzhou, and their actions were extremely domineering and aggressive, which posed a huge problem.

Thus, this extensive journey down the river to inspect the various countries’ mountain waters, shrines, and immortal powers required Chen Ping'an to be exceedingly cautious.

Regardless, setting aside the calculations of the sinking land, since this was the future opportunity for his little green-robed boy to attain the Dao, and after repeated discussions with Cui Dongshan and Wei Ban, they all believed that now was the time to act. So Chen Ping'an would naturally do his utmost to accomplish this.

Chen Ping'an remembered something and patted the sword nurturing gourd, releasing the initial and fifteenth swords.

Liu Zhiqing glanced at him and said disapprovingly, "You’re wasting it."

He had long recognized that the vermilion wine gourd was a sword nurturing gourd, half from observation and half from deduction.

As for the two flying swords whose quality he couldn’t discern, lying in Chen Ping'an's hands, the term "waste" was hardly unfair to this "Good Man."

Liu Zhiqing slowly said, "The speed of these two flying swords, if a sword cultivator truly refines them, would be quite fast. It’s a pity you’re not an innate sword embryo; they are not your destined items. I don’t know how powerful that old golden core sword cultivator’s attack is, and not to mention the peculiar talents of his destined flying sword, at least its speed is truly slow. If you think that the sword cultivators of Bei Ju Luzhou are just exceptions, and all flying swords are this slow, then you will surely face great suffering ahead. When earth immortal sword cultivators engage in life-and-death battles, they don’t just use ten percent of their swords; they might employ some techniques that exhaust their own essence to achieve twelve percent."

Chen Ping'an extended a hand, holding the white and dark green miniature flying swords, gently hovering in his palm. He looked at the initial sword, which was originally named Xiaofengdu, and said, "In the beginning, I intended to refine this one as my destined item outside the five elements. I was fortunate enough to succeed, and while I can’t say it compares to a sword cultivator's destined flying sword, it is surely better than my current situation. However, the one who gifted it to me, I have no doubts about; it just doesn’t seem to be willing to follow me, preferring to stay in the sword nurturing gourd, and I can’t force it. Moreover, it’s futile to try."

Chen Ping'an’s gaze shifted to the fifteenth flying sword and said, "This one I really like. I trust the person I did business with, but I’m still worried. Just in case, I feel quite guilty towards it."

Liu Zhiqing solemnly said, "Refining these kinds of flying swords left behind by sword immortals, the higher the quality, the greater the risk. I’ll only say one thing: do you have the key locations suitable for their habitation, nurturing, and growth? Without this, nothing else matters. It doesn’t matter how many divine coins or treasures you have. The reason why sword cultivators are the most precious in the world is not without reason."

Chen Ping'an smiled and nodded, "Yes, I have three places."

Liu Zhiqing suddenly said, "Chen, teach me a few curses!"

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "I may have some weight behind my fists, but I’m not one to insult or curse others."

Liu Zhiqing stood up, "There’s nothing more to discuss; I’m leaving."

Chen Ping'an also stood, suppressing his smile, and asked, "Liu Zhiqing, before you return to the Golden Crow Palace to cleanse your sword, I have one last question for you."

Liu Zhiqing asked, "Feel free to ask."

Chen Ping'an slowly said, "On what basis do you think the Golden Crow Palace will align with your wishes in everything?"

Liu Zhiqing fell silent.

Chen Ping'an continued, "Before cleansing your sword, you should think this through."

Liu Zhiqing chuckled, "It’s simple. As long as I succeed in cleansing my sword, the Golden Crow Palace will gain another Nascent Soul sword cultivator. After suffering through my sword cleansing, next year, I can gain the blessings of the Nascent Soul’s protection."

Chen Ping'an smirked, "Sword cultivators are indeed straightforward in their dealings."

Liu Zhiqing smiled, "Otherwise, should I learn from you, sunbathing at the shop and picking stones in the stream?"

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "Go on, go on. Just thinking about you potentially becoming a Nascent Soul sword cultivator annoys me even more. How can I let you, Liu Sword Immortal, eat dust in our future sparring sessions?"

Liu Zhiqing scoffed, "You’re bothered? The pebbles in the water at Jade Reflection Cliff, originally worth hundreds of taels of silver, can you sell even one for the price of a snowflake coin? I suspect you’ve already planned it all out, waiting for the right time to sell those forty-nine pebbles, holding them back until I step into the Nascent Soul realm before selling them."

Chen Ping'an laughed heartily, "What a pity you don’t learn from me in business; you have the makings of a good merchant."

As Liu Zhiqing was about to take flight on his sword, Chen Ping'an suddenly said, "Here’s a small piece of advice, no charge. When you reach the Golden Crow Palace, don’t rush to cleanse your sword. You can first act as... a bookkeeper, making a copy of the ancestral hall’s documents to keep close, then quietly observe the Golden Crow Palace for a year and a half from your own peak, taking note of the words and actions of all the cultivators. Record what they say and do, comparing it to their origins and current realms. The more you observe and understand, untangling the threads of human hearts, like a divine being surveying mountains and rivers with their palm, the more adept you will be when it comes time to cleanse your sword."

Liu Zhiqing nodded, "That’s feasible."

Chen Ping'an waved goodbye, "I wish Liu Sword Immortal success in cleansing a great sword."

Liu Zhiqing asked, "What about your shop on Old Huai Street when you leave?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "I can entrust it to a disciple of Song Lanqiao or a cultivator from the Zhaoye Caotang. We can agree on a ninety-one split. I’ve left a few magical treasures in the shop, including a pair of small golden crowns and a dragon chair from a certain lake lord at Cangjun Lake. The prices are all fixed. When it’s time to return to the shop, we’ll tally up the goods and see how much divine money should be earned. If I happen to be away from the shop and something goes missing or gets stolen, I believe the Spring Dew Garden will compensate me at the original price. In any case, I’m not worried; it’s a guaranteed return."

As for the purple robe and other items, Chen Ping'an wouldn’t sell them.

Such immortal items were rather special, extremely rare, akin to military talismans, often priced far higher, yet still had no market. In the future, as more people from Falling Mountain and other peaks gathered, the demand would only increase.

Liu Zhiqing suddenly showed signs of hesitation.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Which item piqued your interest? Friends are friends, but business is business. I can at most offer you... a twenty percent discount, and no lower."

Liu Zhiqing laughed, "With so many sets of the Huangshan Ridge’s most prized works, compared to these already excellent pieces, there’s still a world of difference. How about you gift me a set? Talking about money strains the relationship; I don’t want any discount, just a gift will do."

Chen Ping'an glanced in the direction of Old Huai Street, "It’s quite far."

Liu Zhiqing scoffed, "I can go to the Ant Shop myself to collect it. Just remember to change the lock afterward."

Chen Ping'an sighed and took out a set of the Lan Tianben deity illustrations he had kept in his pocket, tossing it along with the wooden box to Liu Zhiqing.

Liu Zhiqing accepted it with satisfaction.

Beautiful people, beautiful scenery, good wine, and good tea were things Liu Zhiqing enjoyed. The maids on the Forging Peak of the Golden Crow Palace were all quite striking, but they were merely for pleasing the eye. Furthermore, if Forging Peak didn’t accept them, given their looks and mediocre talents, they would merely end up in the hands of that disciple of his palace lord, which would only lead to a minor incident of thundering clouds sending a few sparks.

Chen Ping'an suddenly said, "Actually, I have two sets of the finest works from Huangshan Ridge that, compared to these already excellent pieces, still stand apart."

Liu Zhiqing shook his head, "You should keep them; a gentleman doesn’t take away what others enjoy."

Chen Ping'an extended two fingers, lightly pinching them.

Liu Zhiqing snapped, "I’m out of money!"

Chen Ping'an retracted his hand and grinned, "That set of deity illustrations can’t be gifted to you. But once I return to the Pima Sect, I can talk to Old Master Pang to see if he can paint another set. If it works out, I’ll send it to Forging Peak. If it doesn’t, just consider it didn’t happen."

Liu Zhiqing soared away from Jade Reflection Cliff.

Chen Ping'an also summoned the talisman boat and returned to the Bamboo Sea.

For an entire night, some were walking stakes while others were cultivating, truly a case of being of one mind and two uses, without hindrance.

In the deep of night, Chen Ping'an placed the sword nurturing gourd on the table, retrieved the sword from the sword immortal, and took out one of the fifteenth flying swords. With a lightning-fast motion, he drew the sword from its sheath and sliced a long grinding stone in half. The initial and fifteenth swords hovered nearby, eager for a turn. Chen Ping'an gripped the sword, and his entire arm began to go numb, temporarily losing feeling. Yet he quickly raised the sword again, wide-eyed, carefully inspecting the blade. Finding no minuscule defects or chips, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Chen Ping'an sat cross-legged, preparing to refine the two Dragon-Slaying Platforms, intending to store them in two key locations. He wanted the initial and fifteenth swords to leave the sword nurturing gourd and use these to sharpen their blades gradually, eating away at the two separate Dragon-Slaying Platforms bit by bit.

This Dragon-Slaying Platform was the largest of the three grinding stones gifted by the sword spirit sister after her appearance in Old Dragon City.

He had always been reluctant to let the initial and fifteenth swords consume it.

Now that he had truly embarked on the path of cultivation, especially after making up his mind to refine both initial and fifteenth into his own fateful items that would share life and death with him, he had no reason to hesitate.

Through sparring with Liu Zhiqing, this sword cultivator at the golden core bottleneck, Chen Ping'an felt that his hidden techniques still lacked. They weren't enough—far from it.

Having more skills wouldn’t be a burden.

Even his talisman techniques could be used as a deceptive layer.

Donning a robe and hiding a large stack of common talismans in his sleeve, he could masquerade as a talisman cultivator relying on numbers. Once in close quarters, he would simply be a pure martial artist.

In the midst of the fight, discerning the situation, he could seize the opportunity to transform back into a sword cultivator, with two flying swords, which had greatly increased in speed, making it impossible for his opponent to avoid the fifteenth sword after dodging the initial one.

Finally, there would be that sword immortal.

The following morning, Chen Ping'an went to Old Huai Street but did not open the shop for business. Instead, he visited the old, reputable store that specialized in writing supplies, seeking to establish rapport with an apprentice and roughly negotiating a business intention. The young apprentice found no issue, but he insisted on one thing: the forty-nine pebbles from Jade Reflection Cliff must be carved into various exquisite items by him. They could be done within three days at most, ten snowflake coins, but they could not be sold at the Ant Shop. If not, he could forget about making a living on Old Huai Street. Chen Ping'an agreed, and they arranged to discuss further details at the Ant Shop after closing.

Chen Ping'an then made a trip to Zhaoye Caotang, meeting with one of the two great deities of the Spring Dew Garden, Master Tang, who was also a legendary cultivator there. In his early years, he was not particularly talented and did not join the direct disciples of the Ancestral Hall but eventually excelled in business, relying on generous shares to break through to the golden core stage, earning the respect of others, especially since cultivators of the Spring Dew Garden had always valued commerce.

Tang Qingqing was naturally present.

However, Wei Bai from the Iron Ship Manor and that old woman had already returned to the Great View Dynasty.

Tang Qingqing brewed tea personally, and during their casual chat, Master Tang learned that the young sword immortal planned to become a hands-off shopkeeper. He voluntarily requested to send a clever cultivator to assist at the Ant Shop.

Chen Ping'an proposed a ninety-one split, but Master Tang laughed and said there was no such good fortune. A ten percent share was plenty, as it was merely a simple job of collecting money while seated in the shop. It would be better to fix the remuneration. After a year, the cultivator sent by Zhaoye Caotang would receive thirty snowflake coins. However, Chen Ping'an felt that sticking to the ninety-one split was more reasonable. Master Tang then consented, further inquiring how to account for any price increases that wouldn’t harm returning customers or the shop’s reputation. Chen Ping'an smiled and agreed that this was the best approach. It was indeed wise to leave the shop in the hands of Zhaoye Caotang.

After drinking tea and discussing business, exchanging pleasantries of compliments, Chen Ping'an took his leave.

Tang Qingqing stood outside with her father, puzzled, "Father, I've clarified everything about the ferry. Now that the Spring Dew Garden values him so much, and he’s someone who can invite Liu Sword Immortal to drink tea at the Insect Awakening Manor, what face do we have? Why do you still have to be so stingy? If we want to make friends, we certainly don’t lack divine coins in our family. Why not just buy the entire stock of the shop? He makes a fortune; we could afford to lose a little; wouldn’t that be better?"

The man shook his head, "There’s no such business in the world. If this young sword immortal had plainly come asking for money, not only would I give it, but I would also give a large sum without frowning, treating it as a financial loss to avert disaster. But since he came to do business with us in Zhaoye Caotang, we need to follow the rules, as this will ensure a lasting relationship and prevent good fortune from turning into bad."

Seeing that his daughter hadn’t fully grasped the concept, he smiled, "Aside from sudden wealth, all long-term businesses share a commonality."

He took out a common copper coin from the mountain kingdom, which he had treasured for many years, and laid it in his palm. "One must respect this."

Afterward, Chen Ping'an visited an old woman, the mentor of the golden core shipmaster Song Lanqiao. The old woman was also a golden core cultivator but held a position in the Spring Dew Garden's ancestral hall, which Song Lanqiao did not. In simple terms, during meetings in the ancestral hall, the old woman had a seat at the table, while Song Lanqiao had to stand.

The old woman greeted the young sword immortal with a wide smile, engaging in pleasantries for a good half-hour. Chen Ping'an remained patient until the old woman herself mentioned that she wouldn't want to take up the young sword immortal's time for cultivation. Only then did Chen Ping'an rise to take his leave.

The gift he brought for the old woman was a spiritual tool that he hadn’t placed in the Ant Shop. It was not extravagant but not too cheap either—just delightful.

The old woman wanted to return a gift but was politely declined by Chen Ping'an, who said that if the elder insisted, he would not dare to visit empty-handed next time. The old woman laughed heartily and finally relented.

When Chen Ping'an returned to Old Huai Street just past noon, he opened the shop door, again sitting on a small bamboo chair, basking in the sun.

Business was a bit slow.

People came and went, and after an hour, he made a single sale, earning six snowflake coins. A young female cultivator bought a personal item from the moon palace variety, and after tossing the divine coins on the counter, she hurried out, leaving Chen Ping'an unable to even say "come again."

Chen Ping'an regretted not asking Liu Zhiqing to come by again as a partner.

If the great sword immortal could ask for a set of deity illustrations for free, why couldn’t he have Liu Zhiqing help attract business?

That would be beneficial for Liu Zhiqing’s heart cultivation, wouldn’t it?

As dusk fell, the apprentice from the old store hurried over. Chen Ping'an hung the closed sign and, from one package, took out the forty-nine pebbles, filling the counter.

The young man gulped nervously and asked, "Are these really from Jade Reflection Cliff?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Don’t worry; they’re not hot items. As for how they came to be, you don’t need to concern yourself. You simply need to know that I am the owner of a shop on Old Huai Street with no legs, and with so many precious items in it, do you think I would risk testing whether Liu Sword Immortal's flying sword is fast for this little bit of divine money?"

The young man sighed with relief.

He picked up a pebble, weighed it in his hand, and then examined it closely, smiling, "It’s indeed from the spiritual spring at Jade Reflection Cliff, the quality is exceptionally clear and warm, lacking the hot temper of mountain stones that are hard to wash clean. They are truly good items. To craftsmen at the foot of the mountain, they would likely say, 'A beautiful stone should not be carved.' Master, I’ll take this deal. After so many years of learning from my master, good items from the mountain are hard to find. Our shop has high standards, and since my master doesn’t want to waste such good items, he prefers to do the carving himself, allowing us apprentices to observe. We’ve got no choice; it’s just right for practicing my skills..."

As he spoke, the young man felt a bit awkward.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "That’s alright. No matter how unpleasant the truth is, it’s still the truth. Just hope you can practice, but you must also pay attention, after all, there are only so many pebbles from Jade Reflection Cliff. If you ruin one, there will be one less."

The young man pressed his fingers together, twisting his wrist, with a confident look on his face, promising the young shopkeeper, "This will be one of my first few cuts; I won’t be careless."

Chen Ping'an leaned on the counter and said, "Then I’ll gift you the first pebble as a congratulation for your first cut."

The young man blushed, "That’s not too good."

Chen Ping'an pointed at the pile of pebbles and smiled, "Choose any one, but you must promise me that the first carved pebble will be yours, and for the rest, you must also focus while working on them."

The young man’s face turned red, "Master, just rest assured! I promise each one will be my utmost effort, ten percent effort! Who knows, I might even get a stroke of genius or two. In any case, I won’t let the Ant Shop down."

Chen Ping'an nodded with a smile.

Carving stones was like molding porcelain.

It required skill; everything is hard at the start. 

As long as the first pebble belonged to that young man, as long as he put in the effort and sincerity, the subsequent cuts would naturally follow suit. Even if he got a little distracted, compared to earlier purely transactional cuts, the overall quality of all the stones would still improve. The Ant Shop could naturally command a higher price, easily compensating for the loss of one pebble from Jade Reflection Cliff, and if all went well, the Ant Shop would earn even more.

The world has never been simple; it all comes down to willingness and effort.

As for whether taking on this private work at the Ant Shop would jeopardize the young apprentice's future with his master, the Spring Dew Garden was full of clever individuals.

Chen Ping'an instructed the young apprentice to take the pebbles, and after he carved them into various writing supplies, he could either bring them back to the Ant Shop himself or have friends deliver them, saying he was a friend of the old shopkeeper. At that time, the new shopkeeper wouldn’t make it difficult for him. Alternatively, he could carve one and take one to the shop. After weighing the pros and cons, the young man felt that the latter was more stable and assured the agreeable young shopkeeper that if he lost any pebble, he would personally compensate with a snowflake coin.

Unexpectedly, the young shopkeeper said he wouldn’t mind if anything was truly lost, as long as he had the skills, the Ant Shop could always negotiate.

The young man left with a smile.

Chen Ping'an stood at the shop entrance, watching him go.

He vaguely saw the silhouette of a straw sandal youth delivering a letter.

The next day, after the Ant Shop had been closed for two full days, it unexpectedly opened with a new shopkeeper. Those with good eyes recognized that this person was from Master Tang’s Zhaoye Caotang, wearing a cheerful smile, welcoming customers without missing a beat. The shop’s goods were finally negotiable.

On that day, still dressed in a simple blue shirt, Chen Ping'an strapped on his bamboo box, donned a conical hat, and, holding his walking stick, informed the two maids of the manor that he would leave the Spring Dew Garden today.

The young female cultivator, a direct disciple of the golden core cultivator, said that the ancestor had already sent word to the manor, stating that the talisman boat had been gifted to Chen Sword Immortal, and he need not be polite.

After thanking her, Chen Ping'an did not hold back.

Summoning the talisman boat, he made a trip to Old Huai Street, where at the street's end stood the shade-casting old locust tree.

The young man in the blue shirt stood beneath the locust tree, gazing up, and stood there for a long time.

Many past people and events could be imagined but were unreachable.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 607: A Journey Through Mountains and Waters

Dressed in a blue robe, Chen Ping'an traversed the Lanfang Kingdom, heading north.

The Lanfang Kingdom was renowned for its precious orchids, where people were willing to spend fortunes on a few rare blooms. Wealth was often measured by the number of these expensive flowers one owned. Beyond this, the kingdom had several memorable customs. For example, women often tossed coins into the river to divine fortunes, while the populace, regardless of their wealth, delighted in the act of releasing fish back into the water—a trend that had taken hold among both commoners and nobility. However, it was not uncommon to witness the irony of sincere releases upstream while the downstream fishermen caught turtles and fish with glee. There were also the ferry pullers, whose bare backs were exposed to the sun, marked by deep indentations like dry riverbeds. During droughts or floods, it was customary to parade a paper dragon through the streets—not to pray for rain or avoid it, but to beat the paper dragon until it was in tatters.

North of the Lanfang Kingdom lay the Qingci Kingdom, where the rulers revered Daoism, with Daoist temples dotting the landscape. Buddhism was heavily suppressed, and any temples that remained were cold and deserted.

Further north lay the southern vassal state of the Great Zhuan Dynasty: the Jinfeng Kingdom, known for its martial spirit. Brawls were commonplace in the streets, often resulting in bloodshed. Young heirs from affluent families reveled in archery and swordsmanship, frequently riding out in groups, hunting with hawks and courtesans, oblivious to their surroundings. The ruler of the Jinfeng Kingdom had a military background and sat on the throne after a coup. He emphasized martial prowess over scholarly pursuits, so it was not uncommon for officials to return from court with bruised faces.

What seemed outrageous in other places was a norm among the common folk of the Jinfeng Kingdom. Incidents of a grand scholar being spat on or the Minister of Rites being outmatched in debate by a general were merely fodder for casual conversation.

On this journey, Chen Ping'an encountered a light drizzle on a cliffside path, with raindrops falling like delicate wind chimes. He witnessed a woodcutter in the deep mountains, who, upon finding an orchid, danced with joy as if he had lost his mind.

In the dead of night, the sound of insects filled the air, and the moonlight bathed his blue robe as he sat by a flickering campfire, its light dancing in the darkness. The plum rain season was approaching.

On this day, Chen Ping'an walked slowly through the mountainous outskirts of a city in the Jinfeng Kingdom. This area was plagued by tigers, attracting many chivalrous young nobles from the kingdom to hunt. Along the way, he saw several groups of hunters armed with knives and bows, rushing past with youthful exuberance. Among them were not just boys but also young women, skilled in archery and horsemanship, accompanied by older retainers who were clearly seasoned warriors.

Just a few days ago, Chen Ping'an had witnessed a group of young nobles from the Jinfeng capital gathering in a mountain shrine, drinking heavily and carelessly defacing the walls with graffiti. One tall youth had even hoisted a colorful wooden statue out of the shrine, boasting that he wanted to test his strength against the mountain deity. The mountain god, watching from a distance, sighed in silence.

As dusk fell, Chen Ping'an chose not to enter the city but instead veered away from the main road, climbing over mountains and meandering along a narrow trail. Occasionally, he caught sight of figures—likely practitioners from the Jianghu (martial world), moving with agility. Dressed in his blue robe, he flowed through the forest like a wisp of smoke. 

As night deepened, he suddenly halted atop a towering tree, gazing into the distance at a massive peak surrounded by cliffs on all sides. At its summit, lights flickered from densely clustered buildings. The only connection between his current mountain and that "town" at the top was a rickety wooden bridge swaying gently in the night breeze.

It appeared to be a significant sect in the Jianghu, though the surrounding area was lacking in spiritual energy, only slightly better than the borders of the Yinpingshu Kingdom and the Huaihuang Kingdom—far from an ideal training ground for cultivators.

Perched on a branch, Chen Ping'an munched on a piece of dry biscuit, the wine in his sword gourd from the Lanfang Kingdom still plentiful, as he had not drunk much on his journey.

He closed his eyes to replenish his energy. Despite his efforts, his progress in refining the two Dragon Slaying Platforms remained slow, and he had yet to fully refine them during his travels.

Unbeknownst to him, the lights on the opposite peak gradually dimmed until only a few glimmers remained.

At dawn, Chen Ping'an opened his eyes and affixed a talisman he had learned from Du Yu at the Ghost Axe Palace to himself, continuing his cultivation. 

His northern journey was a leisurely affair, allowing him to roam freely, as long as he arrived at the eastern part of the Green Oriole Kingdom in the Northern Julu Prefecture before autumn. The Green Oriole Kingdom was situated at the mouth of a great river. The terrain of the central Northern Julu Prefecture was elevated, sloping down toward the sea to the east and west, with the northern part being even higher. The entire Northern Julu Prefecture had a geographical layout resembling steps rising from the Bone Marshes northward, where numerous mighty rivers converged into the great riverbed, creating the rare spectacle of two large river mouths.

After thoroughly refining the two Dragon Slaying Platforms, Chen Ping'an placed them in two locations where a "tiny sword qi" had once lingered, with the flying swords entering them on the first and fifteenth days of each month.

Every time the flying swords struck the Dragon Slaying Platforms and sparks flew, it felt like a knife was cutting into his heart. This was the fundamental reason for his slow journey—his speed of refining was barely keeping pace with the Dragon Slaying Platforms as they "fed" on the qi. Only after they had consumed all of the platforms would he begin the critical process of refining them into his life-bound objects, a journey fraught with danger and hardship.

However, the feeling of returning to the dilapidated bamboo house at the foot of the mountain and being fed punches gave Chen Ping'an a strange sense of security.

On the bridge, the sound of carts filled with dung echoed as a large vegetable garden was cleared in the mountains nearby. Soon after, a group of people appeared, carrying water from a distant mountain stream, with children playfully trailing behind, brandishing makeshift buckets.

In the small mountain town atop the peak, the sounds of martial artists practicing their stances and weapons filled the air.

Living on the mountain was somewhat troublesome for those who weren't cultivating in seclusion. The figures that had returned to the town in the early hours of the night were mostly bundled up, with some leading heavily laden donkeys across the bridge back home.

Chen Ping'an intended to stay for two more days, hoping to refine the two Dragon Slaying Platforms using a celestial technique derived from the rain-praying inscription of the Biyou Palace, before continuing his journey.

Including the Jinfeng Kingdom, the ten or so countries north of the Spring Dew Garden were dominated by the Great Zhuan Dynasty, which boasted a thriving martial scene, with martial artists running rampant, even to the extent of hundreds joining forces to besiege mountain sects. 

On this vast territory, only the Jinlin Palace, with a Yuan Ying (Nascent Soul) master in residence, could barely avoid disaster. However, disciples venturing out for experience still had to proceed with utmost caution.

When Chen Ping'an first heard about this in the Spring Dew Garden, he found it hard to believe. But upon learning that four peak martial artists resided in the Northern Julu Prefecture, one of whom had recently risen through the ranks of the Great Zhuan Dynasty, he began to understand.

Currently, Northern Julu Prefecture boasted four peak martial artists. The eldest, once a revered figure in the lower mountains, was close friends with several sword immortals from the higher peaks. For reasons unknown, he succumbed to madness years ago and had to be restrained by several five-realm cultivators, as they could not let their guard down lest they accidentally harm the old warrior’s life. He had even severely injured a celestial being from the Yupu (Jade Purity) realm and was temporarily held in the Tianjun Mansion, awaiting the Tianjun's decree upon his return from the Baoping Continent.

The youngest, just over a hundred years old, was the chief benefactor of a northern sect, married to a newly ascended female sword immortal from the Yupu realm, their age difference being substantial, yet their union was filled with many stories.

Then there was a solitary hermit of the Great Zhuan Dynasty, who had been elusive for decades, with rumors abounding about his fate. Some claimed he had died in a life-and-death struggle with a rival sword immortal, while others suggested he had retreated to the Camellia Cave, attempting to temper his body with spiritual energy, akin to a youth training against the tides at the seaside, before confronting a newly ascended sword immortal from the Monkey Crying Mountain.

The latest figure was notoriously mysterious, rarely making a move, but each time he did, he almost never killed anyone. Yet, he had destroyed two ancestral halls belonging to sects guarded by Yuan Ying sword cultivators, which led the Northern Julu martial community to assert that he was another newly risen peak martial artist with ties to the Lion Peak, going by the name of "Li Er."

The Great Zhuan Dynasty also had an eighth-realm martial artist who was relatively easier to encounter—a female grandmaster and swordswoman, currently serving as the personal attendant of the Great Zhuan Emperor. However, her future was not bright, as reaching the realm of far travel would be her peak, and she was destined never to ascend to the pinnacle of martial prowess.

In short, in this realm, Jianghu martial artists had the loudest voices and the strongest fists.

Chen Ping'an found the martial artists beyond the dilapidated mountain to be somewhat inscrutable.

The first was Su Lang, the Qingzhu Sword Immortal, who had wanted to ask Old Song for guidance. 

The second was the one who ambushed him in the Dragon Palace of Cangyun Lake.

The third was Liao, a retainer by Wei Bai's side on the ferry.

Chen Ping'an was keen to find a peak martial artist for a spar, but regrettably, the high-profile figure on the ferry seemed to be an eighth-realm martial artist, who, despite his considerable aura, had taken his own life with his sword. Just before his head hit the ground, he proclaimed, "Three of you from the Pima Sect in the Yupu realm are unworthy of this kill," showing a hint of heroism.

Previously, while fishing at a lake in the Jinfeng Kingdom, Chen Ping'an had quietly observed a bloody massacre that seemed premeditated. 

An internal conflict erupted on a boat anchored in the lake, dividing dozens into two factions, armed with various weapons. Among them, about ten of the top martial artists from Jinfeng, likely five or six realm fighters, clashed violently, limbs and heads flying. Subsequently, seven or eight military warships from the Jinfeng Kingdom appeared, illuminated by bright lanterns, turning the lake into daylight as they surrounded the original boat heavily. After several rounds of heavy crossbow fire, as the martial artists on both sides fell, the remaining fighters took refuge in the cabins. The military ships then slammed into the original boat, during which some injured martial artists attempted to break through the siege, unwilling to wait for death, only to be forced back by a rain of arrows or killed on the spot by a burly eunuch clad in a python robe, or cleaved in half by a young female swordswoman's sword qi. A robust general in dew armor stood at the bottom of the ship, initially not taking action.

Some martial artists pretending to be injured and falling into the lake attempted to hold their breath and swim away, but they could not escape. Creatures lurking beneath the surface seemed to have been prepared, forcing several martial artists to surface, where they were all shot dead by the burly general, each one pierced through the head.

As the military ships approached, Chen Ping'an quietly rowed his small boat away.

The final scene left a deep impression on Chen Ping'an.

The female swordswoman stood at the bow of the boat, continuously striking with her sword, piercing through both the floating corpses and those who had fallen into the lake, infusing them with fierce sword qi.

By the end, it was likely that few survived from that boat in the lake.

Those who did survive were probably internal agents of the court.

Chen Ping'an saw three figures ascend to the top of the warship, bowing to the robust general clad in dew armor.

He closed his eyes, returning to his task of refining the Dragon Slaying Platforms.

In the realm of cultivation, once one truly delves in, they realize that the most worthless yet most precious thing is time.

As for the events in the Jianghu, Chen Ping'an never entertained the thought of intervening.

That night, Chen Ping'an gently exhaled a breath of stale air and looked up to see a pair of young lovers on the bridge. The woman was a decent martial artist, around the third realm, while the man appeared refined and scholarly, not quite a true martial artist. She walked carefully across the swaying iron rope, and the slightly older man, worried for her safety, grasped her hand as she jumped down at the bridge's end.

The two walked hand in hand along the mountain path, whispering sweet nothings, their conversation drifting in Chen Ping'an's direction.

He caught snippets of insider gossip about the Jinfeng Kingdom’s court and the Jianghu.

As it turned out, the Jianghu had been quite tumultuous in recent years. According to the unofficial histories of the Jinfeng Kingdom, upon ascending the throne, the current emperor's first act was to unsheathe a sword on his knee, commanding several noble families that managed the royal genealogy book to gather in the grand hall. One by one, with the names read from the records, heads rolled outside the hall, as he sought to eliminate the remnants of the previous dynasty. That night, blood flowed like rivers, but one name slipped through the cracks: the youngest son of the former emperor, who was spirited away by a maid and secretly escorted out of the capital by loyal ministers, disappearing into the Jianghu without a trace. Therefore, throughout the years, the Jianghu had been plagued by mysterious massacres, often involving major sects. Even when it was evident that some deaths were due to vendettas, the local authorities hesitated to investigate, fearing they might cross the emperor's forbidden line. With the government handcuffed and the Jinfeng Kingdom valuing martial prowess, local generals delighted in using the guise of hunting down bandits to train their soldiers, leading to the suffering of legitimate Jianghu practitioners with families.

The chaotic state of the Jianghu could not continue like this, so several venerable masters of the Jinfeng Jianghu, along with a handful of notorious figures from the demonic path, were rarely seen setting aside their differences to secretly meet for a banquet. They weren’t planning a rebellion; rather, they thought it more prudent to help the emperor find the long-lost prince of the previous dynasty, for once he was dead, the emperor would surely be pleased, and the chaotic situation in the Jianghu might improve, granting everyone a chance to breathe.

The young couple, discussing the blood-soaked battles, were filled with concern.

Their sect, known as the Zhengrong Sect, was a leading force in the Jinfeng Kingdom. As per the classifications of Jianghu practitioners, nearly a hundred well-documented sects drew a clear line: the ascension of the current emperor marked the division between the new and old Jianghu. New sects often relied on the support of noble families or powerful local lords, while the old Jianghu struggled for survival. The Zhengrong Sect naturally belonged to the latter, and the woman’s father was one of the four esteemed masters of the righteous path.

However, the latest news she received was that the banquet's location had finally been decided—on a large island in the heart of a lake, where neither side could intervene.

Both the righteous and demonic factions were hesitant to hold discussions on each other's territory, wary of being ambushed. Righteous practitioners viewed the demonic ones as cruel and unruly, while the rogues viewed the so-called righteous as hypocritical scoundrels, unworthy of comparison.

Yet, beyond these troubling thoughts, under the moonlight, the pair, lost in their own world, felt unable to restrain their emotions in the quiet, secluded night.

Earlier, the woman had held a branch while practicing her stances, throwing punches with one hand and exhibiting flashy sword movements with the other.

Chen Ping'an sighed softly. The leader of the Zhengrong Sect must be one of the last three surviving masters from the lake, as his fighting style bore some resemblance to that of the woman beneath the tree, and he was often seen with a soft sword at his waist, employing an exceedingly graceful and cunning swordplay.

As the couple leaned into each other, their movements grew more intimate.

If it had ended there, Chen Ping'an could have simply closed his eyes to meditate. However, he feared that they might get carried away in the heat of the moment.

True to his worries, the couple moved behind a tree, and the woman suggested they find a spot with denser shade, more concealed, so that he wouldn’t be allowed to get handsy.

The young man smiled and agreed. The woman grasped his shoulder, preparing to leap up.

With a talisman affixed to himself, Chen Ping'an surveyed the area, flicking his fingers to cause a pebble to shatter in the underbrush.

The couple jumped in surprise and turned to look.

Chen Ping'an rose and swiftly departed.

"Go on, the territory is yours."

He ascended to a higher spot on the mountain to continue refining the Dragon Slaying Platforms.

However, after the couple recovered from their shock, they lingered for a moment before quickly heading back to the bridge. The Zhengrong Sect was brightly lit, a sea of white light.

Then they gathered at the main entrance, seemingly preparing to welcome distinguished guests.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 608: Thoughts on the Breeze**

Chen Ping'an gazed into the distance, where a slender fire dragon meandered down the mountain path, moving gracefully forward. To his eyes, it looked no different from the fiery dragon drawn in ink by Liu Zhiqing on the desk. 

There must be a large group ascending the majestic Zhenrong Mountain tonight.

In fact, Chen Ping'an had sensed something amiss the previous night. He noticed a few figures reminiscent of scouts—rogue martial artists sneaking about, seemingly probing the terrain.

After pondering for a moment, he stood up and took a roundabout route to the cliff's edge, deliberately distancing himself from the lights near the mountain gate. He stepped back a few paces, then leapt into action, gripping the sheer cliff of the lone peak of Zhenrong Mountain. He traversed sideways, eventually hiding quietly beneath the suspension bridge, his fingers embedded in the stone wall as he swayed gently with the wind, one hand retrieving his wine flask from the sword sheath.

At one end of the bridge stood Lin Shu, the master of Zhenrong Gate, his complexion pale. He had suffered serious injuries in the recent battle on the lake, and was still on the mend. However, the stakes were high, with a monumental fortune at hand, and his spirits remained buoyant.

The three distinguished guests visiting Zhenrong Gate this time included General Du Ying, who served the nation, and the current emperor's adopted son, as well as a cunning eunuch from the Imperial Horse Guard, and a guest from the Great Zhuang Dynasty, Zheng Shuizhu. Known for her exceptional swordsmanship, her master was the gatekeeper of the imperial palace in the Great Zhuang Dynasty.

Zheng Shuizhu was among the five most favored disciples of the renowned female martial deity from the Great Zhuang, also being the core disciple, the one with the highest aptitude and greatest favor. Her participation in the encirclement on the lake was merely to relax, yet her sect had entrusted her with important responsibilities. Lin Shu had been one of the first martial masters to pledge allegiance to the new emperor, retreating from the martial world for over a decade. Rumors spoke of a fierce black flood dragon lurking in the rivers outside the Great Zhuang capital, a powerful entity that had lived in harmony with humanity for a thousand years. Recently, however, there had been continuous floods, hinting at a disaster that could engulf the capital. Thus, Lin Shu guessed that Zheng Shuizhu's journey south might be related to the sword enshrined in the martial temple of the Golden Door Kingdom. After all, while her master was a grandmaster capable of traversing the winds, his sword was still a formidable weapon. Yet, facing a flood dragon might require a celestial-grade weapon capable of subduing such creatures.

The treasure blade of the Golden Door Kingdom, stained with the blood of over a hundred previous dynasty's dragon sons and grandsons, had also severed the head of the former general, who had been the greatest obstacle to the current emperor's ascension.

It could be said that this sword had completely severed the previous dynasty's lineage.

At the other end of the bridge, General Du Ying still donned his snow-white armor and leaned on his sword, not stepping onto the bridge.

A young swordswoman of about twenty-five or twenty-six, shouldered a long sword named "Moonshade." This sword was her master's cherished possession, having accompanied him through the long trials of body and Qi refinement until he reached the Divine Refinement stage, at which point he gifted it to his core disciple, Zheng Shuizhu. The previous four senior disciples had never had such honor. When the sword was gifted, Zheng Shuizhu had just turned six, her small hands barely able to grasp the sword, which was taller than her. Upon seeing this, her stoic master burst into laughter, though the perceptive Zheng Shuizhu noticed the differing expressions of her senior brothers and sisters.

Now, Zheng Shuizhu looked around as the mountain winds howled. Across from her, the small town built on the lone peak was ablaze with lights, resembling a grand lantern floating in the night.

As for the eunuch from the Imperial Horse Guard, he rubbed his hands together lightly. Though his hair was white, his skin was fair and delicate, radiating vitality; after all, he was a martial artist of the Golden Body stage, known as the spirit of the night in the capital of the Golden Door Kingdom.

In terms of realm and combat prowess, the old eunuch was significantly stronger than Zheng Shuizhu. However, during this long journey south, he had remained respectful towards the young woman. With her physique and cultivation at the Fifth stage, she could unleash sword energy and lethal force comparable to that of the Sixth stage—a benefit of high-born lineage, a safeguard for her travels. Moreover, her master's reputation served as a life-preserving talisman, allowing her to act without fear of reprisal from the various factions in the Great Zhuang and neighboring nations. As long as Zheng Shuizhu targeted enemies other than foreign generals and officials, no one would hold her accountable. Yet, this was her first time leaving the capital of the Great Zhuang, and with a secret mission at hand, she was not as renowned as her four senior siblings.

The three distinguished guests halted, leaving Lin Shu no choice but to remain in place.

Du Ying suddenly spoke, "I have been responsible for tracking the remnants of the previous dynasty for over a decade. I have personally scrutinized more than a hundred martial sects, all of which were of comparable age. Given my title as the general, I have traversed this far in the martial world, unable to return home. It's quite exhausting. Even a father searching for his lost child doesn't suffer as much as I do. Wouldn't you agree, Lin Gate Master?"

Lin Shu clasped his fists, "General, your hard work and accomplishments are commendable! This time, General has orchestrated the complete eradication of the martial forces. I believe, upon your return to the capital..."

Du Ying waved his hand, interrupting Lin Shu's words. "However, collaborating with you, Lin Gate Master, has made me realize how dark it is under the lamp. I have passed by Zhenrong Mountain for so many years without personally searching."

Lin Shu broke into a cold sweat.

Du Ying smiled, "Of course, the court spies planted beside you had previously conducted a thorough investigation. Two elite spies with no connection to each other both reported that there was nothing."

Lin Shu felt a weight lift off his shoulders as he raised his arm high towards the capital and solemnly declared, "General, I, Lin Shu, and Zhenrong Mountain remain ever loyal to His Majesty the Emperor; heaven is witness!"

Du Ying slowly drew his sword and pointed towards the small town atop the mountain. "Now, there is a most secure method. It depends on whether Lin Gate Master possesses enough loyalty and courage to execute it. The ages recorded in the Zhenrong Gate genealogy and the local county archives can be fabricated. Thus, it would be better to kill all the young men in that town aged between eighteen and twenty, particularly those who resemble a weak youth. That way, everything will be settled."

Du Ying chuckled, "Of course, people cannot die for nothing. As a general, I cannot let the merit go unrewarded. After I return to the capital and meet with His Majesty, I will personally request a reward. For the head that rolls from Zhenrong Mountain tonight, I will compensate you, Lin Shu, with one thousand taels of silver. For every ten heads collected, I will allocate a piece of the territory belonging to those sects that perished on the lake to Zhenrong Gate to manage."

Lin Shu forced a smile, "But what if there are petty people in Zhenrong Gate who falsely report information to the general? They might deliberately place me, Lin Shu, in a position of disloyalty and injustice?"

Du Ying nodded, "Indeed, there are petty individuals, and not just one. One is your unworthy disciple, who feels that under normal circumstances, he has no hope of inheriting the position of gate master. Having almost been driven out of the sect by you in the past, it is natural for him to harbor resentment and seek to turn the tables, aiming to seize the position of gate master. I have verbally agreed to this. Once Lin Gate Master takes care of him, it will be fine. Such people, not to mention managing half the martial world, would struggle to manage even a single Zhenrong Gate."

Du Ying pointed the tip of his sword toward the entrance of the bridge and continued, "There is another, a young man who has been closely associated with the court spy. This spy was previously your town's schoolmaster, and the young man, a promising scholar, harbored feelings for your daughter. However, you considered him unworthy of your daughter due to his lack of martial talent. Later, the old spy deemed him suitable for an official's position before his death. Under the old spy's machinations, the young man inherited his former master's identity and began to correspond with the court in secret. In fact, the idea to eliminate all Zhenrong disciples of suitable age was his. I have also agreed to this; not only will I ensure his secret is kept, and he will win the fair maiden, but I will also arrange for him to enter the officialdom through the imperial examinations, ensuring he will surely make his mark in a decade or two, becoming a high-ranking official in the Golden Door Kingdom."

Lin Shu's face turned ashen with rage, gritting his teeth, "That ungrateful wretch! His parents died young, and he was raised in the most degrading of circumstances. If it weren't for Zhenrong Gate providing him with a monthly stipend, he would be eating dung!"

The old eunuch from the Imperial Horse Guard twirled a strand of white hair hanging down from his temple and squeaked, "These are trivial matters. The real problem lies in the intelligence from another spy, indicating that there is a high-level expert still stationed at Zhenrong Gate. They have hidden themselves well for many years and have yet to reveal their true identity, which is quite troublesome."

Lin Shu was taken aback.

Zheng Shuizhu frowned, "General Du, are we just going to linger here? Whether that remnant of the previous dynasty is on the mountain can be determined with a sword. If there truly is a Qi practitioner from the Golden Scales Palace hiding here, they must be the protector of the prince. It would kill two birds with one stone—eliminate the remnant and conveniently capture the Golden Scales practitioner."

Among the group, a dull-witted man held a long box.

Du Ying chuckled, "What if that Golden Scales practitioner has an extremely high realm? Our hundred or so armored soldiers might not withstand a few of their celestial techniques. Even if we three can prevail, if they summon others through the wind, we would just have to watch them escape. We certainly can't jump off the cliff, can we?"

Zheng Shuizhu turned to glance at the man with the box and scoffed, "Our national protector's eldest disciple is here, and you still fear a Qi practitioner hiding in Zhenrong Mountain for over a decade?"

In the Great Zhuang Dynasty, Zheng Shuizhu's faction of pure martial artists had always had a poor relationship with the faction led by the National Protector, Liang Hongyin. Their ties had been strained, leading to numerous conflicts. The vastness of the Great Zhuang allowed the emperor to let both sides act according to their prowess, leading to inevitable discord. One of Zheng Shuizhu's exceptionally gifted senior brothers had once been ambushed by three concealed practitioners from the Sea Viewing and Dragon Gate realms, breaking both his legs and relegating him to a wheelchair. Subsequently, a direct disciple of the National Protector also mysteriously disappeared during training, with his body never found.

The man with the covered face bore a cold expression, casting a glance at Zheng Shuizhu's back. This little girl had always looked down on others, never content in the capital, relying on her mother's favoritism. A few years back, she had flirted with a prince of the Great Zhuang, truly believing herself to be the chosen one to become the next empress.

Du Ying asked, "Lin Gate Master, what do you say?"

Lin Shu's face twisted in anger. "Kill all the young men of suitable age on the mountain! But I have two demands: that disciple who betrayed his master must die, and that ungrateful wretch must die as well! The methods Zhenrong Gate employs to deal with traitors may not be unique in the Golden Door Kingdom, but they can make a person wish they were dead."

Du Ying shook his head. "The former is a waste, so killing him is inconsequential. However, the latter is ambitious and intelligent. The secret letters he has sent to the court over the years contain not only plots from the martial world but also many suggestions for governance. I have carefully reviewed each one, and they hold great insight. It is likely that His Majesty the Emperor has seen those letters. The phrase 'a scholar does not leave home but knows the affairs of the world' aptly describes such a person."

Lin Shu suppressed his fury, his face darkening. "General, this person is about... twenty-four or twenty-five this year, close to twenty!"

Du Ying chuckled in disbelief, pausing for a moment before shaking his head. "Tonight's visit is merely precautionary, assisting Lin Gate Master in cleaning house and clearing the path for the peak of the martial world. I am not one to kill indiscriminately."

The old eunuch smiled, "We'll observe the situation and aren't in a hurry. Tonight will bring some excitement."

Du Ying glanced at the suspension bridge. "What I'm most afraid of is that a Golden Scales practitioner may act while we are halfway across the bridge. What if it collapses?"

The old eunuch nodded, "That would be a significant problem."

The dull man with the long box replied indifferently, "General Du need not worry. As long as they dare to act, the bridge will not collapse; that person will surely die."

Du Ying smiled, "Are you certain, Immortal Master?"

The man nodded, "Our National Protector's estate would not deceive General Du."

If a first-rank national general and the adopted son of the Golden Door Kingdom's emperor were to die, it would indeed cause some trouble, especially since the ascension of the new ruler was orchestrated by the National Protector's estate. A rebellious general holding heavy military power and a legitimate sovereign of a vassal state possessed utterly different identities. The former could be easily disposed of by the National Protector's estate, while the latter was untouchable.

Du Ying sheathed his sword and waved his hand. "Cross the bridge!"

At that moment, within the small town at the summit of Zhenrong Peak, an old man grabbed a young man's shoulder, soaring through the air. The old man shimmered with radiant light, resembling golden scales glistening in the night sky, drawing attention.

Du Ying looked up, "Indeed, the persistent Golden Scales practitioner appears restless."

Behind Du Ying, the man with the long box had already dashed forward, transforming into a streak of rainbow light—he was a Golden Pill practitioner known for his combat prowess, and also the National Protector's foremost disciple.

The Golden Scales practitioner was likely a Dragon Gate realm cultivator, accompanied by others in flight. The swordsman, already a level higher, wielded a treasured blade that absorbed the prayers of the people. With a single stroke, he cleaved towards the Golden Scales practitioner. The practitioner quickly formed a seal, and his shimmering golden robe shed itself, hovering in place, suddenly expanding into a golden fishing net that blocked the sword's light, while the old man continued to carry the young man away from Zhenrong Peak.

The blade of the Golden Pill practitioner from the National Protector's estate sliced through the robe, propelling him forward. In an instant, he reached the back of the old Golden Scales practitioner, and with another strike, the old man attempted to throw the young man away. However, the latter had summoned several floating talismans from the Golden Scales Palace, granting him temporary wind-walking abilities like a Qi practitioner. Yet, the old practitioner knew this was merely a desperate struggle. Who could have imagined that not only had the Golden Door Kingdom found Zhenrong Mountain, but they had also dispatched a Golden Pill practitioner from the National Protector's estate?

With a slight twist of the wrist, the treasured blade that had been enshrined in the martial temple for years altered its trajectory. With a single stroke, it severed the heads of both the old practitioner and the young man.

Before his death, the old practitioner unleashed all his spiritual energy in a last-ditch effort, hoping to take the Golden Pill practitioner down with him.

The swordsman retreated, suspended in the air, as the bodies of the old Golden Scales practitioner and the young man crumbled into dust. A fierce and chaotic wind erupted within a ten-zhang radius, causing the suspension bridge behind to shake violently, sending several armored soldiers tumbling down. Only with the combined weight of Du Ying and Zheng Shuizhu could the bridge be stabilized.

The dull man gazed down at the blade's edge, nodding slightly, then furrowing his brows. He returned to the bridge, gently landing.

Du Ying lowered his voice and asked, "What now? Was that indeed the remnant?"

The man nodded, "The blood is undeniable, but the dragon's aura is insufficient. It somewhat diminishes the blade's overpowering effect. However, this is expected. Once the royal lineage is severed, even a former emperor would see their dragon aura diminish year by year."

Du Ying took a deep breath, gripping a chain tightly. "At last, I can stand tall and return to the capital as a true national general!"

The man cautiously secured the treasured blade in the long box, a smile breaking through his normally stoic demeanor. "General Du, this is not only a great achievement in the eyes of your emperor."

He tossed the wooden box to Zheng Shuizhu, his smile fading. "For our heroine Zheng, it also carries considerable merit."

Zheng Shuizhu's expression turned skeptical as she frowned. "Feng Yi, why not take it directly back to the National Protector's estate?"

It was clear she worried that this Golden Pill practitioner might claim credit for the blade and approach the emperor of the Great Zhuang.

The man couldn't be bothered to argue with her.

That troublesome black flood dragon aimed to submerge the capital of the Great Zhuang, transforming it into its underwater palace, while his master was merely a Yuan Ying practitioner skilled in water techniques. How could he compete with a primordial flood dragon? Ultimately, they needed the strength of this little girl’s master to hope for a decisive blow against the evil dragon. The National Protector's practitioners, at most, would strive to protect the capital from flooding during the ensuing conflict. A monumental event could lead to total disaster; if any misstep occurred, the entire Great Zhuang dynasty’s fortune could suffer. The National Protector's estate would not seize credit from a young girl at such a critical moment. Furthermore, once the battle commenced, the true efforts would undoubtedly fall upon Zheng Shuizhu's master, leaving Feng Yi, as the National Protector's foremost disciple, no reason to rob the blade from her.

Lin Shu's legs felt weak as he leaned against the iron chain.

The remnant had indeed been hiding right under his nose!

Du Ying chuckled, "Enough. You, Lin Shu, have diligently served His Majesty for many years, relaying intelligence to the capital. This time, on the lake, you helped me eliminate both righteous and evil masters, and tonight you have also resolved an old grudge."

Lin Shu's smile was stiff, hearing Du Ying’s comforting words, both relieved and yet still wary of the court's potential reprimand.

Du Ying preferred not to say much, allowing Lin Shu to remain on edge. Individuals like Lin Shu and Zhenrong Mountain were akin to fish in muddy waters—essential but entirely expendable. If anyone else were to complete tasks for the court, they would certainly work hard, yet might not be as useful as Lin Shu. Moreover, with so much leverage held by Du Ying and the court, Zhenrong Mountain would only become more compliant, acting without scruple. In the end, the court would benefit from the strife between the martial world while remaining clean of bloodshed.

Du Ying hesitated. "Tonight we will make camp at Zhenrong Mountain."

Lin Shu whispered, "What about those young men of suitable age?"

Du Ying appeared conflicted.

The Golden Pill practitioner from the National Protector's estate smirked slightly, casually remarking, "Better to be cautious; a ship steers well for a thousand years. Lin Gate Master, you handle it."

Lin Shu's eyes hardened.

The group crossed the suspension bridge and entered the brightly lit small town.

Amid the cliffs, Chen Ping'an remained perfectly still.

In the hall of Zhenrong Gate at the top of Zhenrong Peak, blood pooled across the floor.

Lin Shu sat expressionless in the master seat.

Zheng Shuizhu, General Du Ying, the old eunuch from the Imperial Horse Guard, and the dull man from the National Protector's estate took their respective seats in order.

Opposite them sat several elders from the Lin family, followed by Lin Shu's only daughter and all of Lin Shu's personal disciples. None dared to meet their gazes.

Previously, the gate master Lin Shu had adamantly refused to sit in the master seat, and only after the displeasure of the swordswoman opposite had he nervously taken his seat.

In the hall, over half of the young men around twenty years old lay dead.

Zheng Shuizhu's face was frosty as she turned to look, "Is it fun to kill these useless people?!"

Feng Yi from the National Protector's estate smiled, "Perhaps we can catch a big fish from the Golden Scales Palace."

A distance from the Zhenrong Gate hall, a youth who had replaced the old schoolmaster stood, coldly laughing. He stomped his foot, and a long sword sprang from the ground. Holding the sword, he walked past the schoolhouse's gate, striding down the street toward the place of conflict.

The Golden Scales Palace had a dire relationship with the Great Zhuang Dynasty, their relationship teetering on the brink of open hostility.

Now that the matter here was settled, he had no qualms about slaying a Golden Pill cultivator from the Great Zhuang. If he wasn't mistaken, that young swordswoman was the beloved disciple of the eight-realm martial artist. Killing two of them, especially losing that blade capable of subduing the flood dragon, with Du Ying still alive, would surely drive the emperor of the Golden Door Kingdom into a frenzy, making it impossible to explain to the emperor of the Great Zhuang.

On the cliff, Chen Ping'an released his grip, allowing himself to plummet swiftly downward.

As he neared the cliff's base, he reached out to grip the rock face, slowing his descent before gently landing and making his way away.

This was likely a deeply plotted hunt.

Though everyone had their own desires.

Once one truly emerged and stepped into the fray, the higher the realm, the faster one might perish.

Chen Ping'an would not intervene.

The remnants of the previous dynasty fleeing the capital, the usurping emperor of the Golden Door Kingdom, the scheming adopted son Du Ying stirring chaos in the martial world, Lin Shu of Zhenrong Gate pledging allegiance to the court, the Golden Scales practitioners secretly protecting the prince, the eight-realm martial artist from the Great Zhuang, and the Golden Pill cultivators from the National Protector's estate—all, alongside the flood dragon threatening to inundate the Great Zhuang capital.

Chen Ping'an moved away.

Behind him, the bright little town atop the peak would surely harbor a multitude of complex and intricate stories, each with its own joys and sorrows. Some might go to their graves never knowing the reasons behind their fate.

The top-ranked disciple of the Golden Scales Palace, self-assured in his invincibility tonight, suddenly found a hole pierced through his brow. In a flash of rainbow light, his Golden Pill was instantly shattered.

Before dying, the concealed Golden Pill swordsman stared wide-eyed in shock, whispering, "Sword Immortal Ji Yue..."

His body quickly dissolved into a puddle of blood.

On the opposite peak, a short old man stood with his hands clasped behind his back. "A mere Golden Pill dares to thwart my plans? If in the next life, I can be reborn, I must learn from that young man, who has escaped danger twice."

In an instant, the short old man appeared beside the young man in the green robe, walking side by side. "Outsider, how did you sense something was off? Care to share? Or were you just here to stir the pot? You seem young but act with great wisdom."

Chen Ping'an, staff in hand, continued walking without pause, smiling, "Senior, just focus on using big bait to catch big fish. I am too timid to wade into this murky water."

The short old man scratched his head, "Do you think that remnant from the previous dynasty is dead?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "It should be a case of misdirection. He possesses dragon blood but is not a true dragon. Lin Shu is indeed a loyal man to the previous emperor, determined to protect that scholar. Du Ying and his entourage were indeed deceived. That old Golden Scales practitioner was decisive, helping to maintain the illusion. As for that young man, he is quite astute; otherwise, it would have been difficult to reach this point with only Lin Shu. But for you, their trifling skirmish is merely a joke. After all, it is better for the dragon lineage of the previous dynasty to remain alive, as that blade capable of subduing the flood dragon was slightly lacking in potency. The true hidden expert of Zhenrong Gate only needed to remain still, and they need not die under your flying sword."

"Honestly, speak freely, and you will escape another calamity."

After a brief silence, the old man remarked, "Interesting, quite interesting. What a pity, truly a pity."

The blue-robed traveler stopped, laughing, "Senior, don't scare me. I'm quite timid. If you’re this fierce, I certainly can't fight you. If it comes to that, I can only bring out my master and senior brothers to protect myself."

The short old man burst into laughter, glancing at the young man's appearance, nodding. "Cunning and sharp; you deserve to live. You remind me of my younger self, quite the charming and slick character. If I truly kill that old rascal in the end, come to Yuanting Mountain to find me. If anyone obstructs you, just say you know an old man named Ji."

"By the way, with your cleverness, don’t think about tipping off the emperor of the Great Zhuang. It’s not worth the risk."

Chen Ping'an sighed.

So, it was indeed the legendary Ji Yue, the immortal realm swordsman.

Chen Ping'an turned to gaze at the bright little town atop the lone peak and suddenly asked, "Senior, I've heard that when the great swordsman strikes, they can sever certain causes and effects?"

Ji Yue contemplated for a moment and replied, "I am not yet capable of that."

There was silence between them.

The old man suddenly shook his head, saying, "You, young man, have had quite the misfortune to encounter me twice, nearly dying three times. You truly remind me of my younger days."

Chen Ping'an smiled, "You get used to it."

The old man waved his hand. "Let’s go. For those who practice the sword, don't be too resigned to your fate."

The green-robed wanderer strode forward.

The short old man rubbed his head, watching the young man's jade hairpin with a complex gaze, sighing softly. What he had earlier deemed a pity was regarding that audacious scholar who dared to act against the heavens.

He couldn't help but create a small world with a flick of his sleeve and then asked, "Are you a disciple from the Treasure Vase Continent?"

The young man turned his head but said nothing.

Ji Yue's expression remained calm as he clasped his hands behind his back, speaking in a low voice, "Don't embarrass your master."

The young man hesitated, then nodded.

Ji Yue still did not remove his restrictions but suddenly laughed, "If I get the chance, I’ll let your left master know that his swordsmanship… is actually not that high. I was careless back then; my realm was not high enough to withstand his strike."

The young man's expression turned strange.

Ji Yue waved his hand. "Let me remind you, it's best to conceal that hairpin well. While I was close to the scene of that incident in the south and caught a glimpse, it does seem somewhat familiar. Even so, without a closer look, even I couldn't detect anything unusual. But what if? Not all sword practitioners are like me, disdainful of bullying juniors. The current so-called sword immortals on the Northern Continent would likely recognize your identity. Most would not hesitate to act. As for whether killing you would provoke your left master to cross over to the Northern Continent, for those ignorant Yuan Ying and Jade Purity youngsters, that's merely a delightful endeavor. They are truly fearless, which is the atmosphere of our Northern Continent—both good and bad."

The young man clasped his fists. "Thank you for your guidance, senior. I will remember."

Ji Yue waved his hand and disappeared in a flash.

Chen Ping'an distanced himself from Zhenrong Peak, continuing his solitary journey.

Such is the martial world, where one never knows what storms lie ahead.

As the plum rain season arrived, Chen Ping'an simply detoured around the Great Zhuang Dynasty and headed for a coastal vassal state.

On the cliffside path, the rain poured heavily. Chen Ping'an lit a campfire, staring blankly at the curtain of rain outside. With the rain, the heat of the world seemed to dissipate significantly.

The rain pattered, slow and deliberate, willows swayed gently, lotus blooms round and full. The mountains were lush, the road long, and thoughts wandered, lost in longing. 

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 609: Scholars, Wanderers, and Beauties (Part 1)

The air was thick and humid, the earth damp and heavy with moisture, making the world feel like a steam basket, inevitably weighing down the hearts of those who traversed it.

On a long-abandoned tea-horse road in the Kingdom of Wuling, five riders moved slowly along the path.

Suddenly, a torrential rainstorm hit. Even though they donned their raincoats, the raindrops, as big as yellow beans, stung their cheeks painfully. The group hurriedly spurred their horses, searching for shelter from the rain. Finally, they spotted a resting pavilion halfway up the mountain and dismounted in haste.

To their surprise, they found a young man in a green robe sitting cross-legged on a bench in the pavilion. Beside him lay a large bamboo box, and in front of him was a chessboard with two small celadon jars. Over twenty black and white pieces were already set upon the board. Upon seeing them, he did not show any fear; instead, he looked up with a slight smile and continued placing pieces on the board.

A burly man with a sword glanced at the young man’s robe and shoes, noting the absence of water stains. It seemed the young man had been resting here for a while, avoiding the downpour, and had simply waited for the rain to stop before he resumed his journey, taking the opportunity to play a game by himself.

An elderly gentleman of noble demeanor stood at the entrance of the pavilion. As the rain showed no sign of stopping anytime soon, he turned and asked with a smile, “Since we have some time, young sir, would you mind playing a game of chess?”

The young man in the green robe pondered for a moment, then swept his hand across the chess pieces on the board, gathering them not back into the jars but instead stacking them between himself and the board. He nodded with a smile, “Sure.”

A pair of young lovers exchanged smiles at the scene.

A woman wearing a veil settled herself on the opposite bench, placing a handkerchief beneath her.

The elderly man picked up a handful of white pieces and chuckled, “Since I am a few years older, young sir, you may go first.”

The young man, Chen Ping’an, selected a black piece. The elder placed the white piece on the board—seven in total—and with a smile said, “It’s your move.”

Unbeknownst to them, Chen Ping’an had adjusted his sitting position, no longer cross-legged but seated sideways like the elder, one hand resting on his sleeve while the other moved pieces on the board.

The young lad whispered to the girl beside him, “Just look at his demeanor; he seems like a master at chess.”

The girl smiled back, “No matter how skilled he is, can he compare with our grandfather?”

The boy was keen on proving himself against the girl, “I think this man is quite formidable. Grandfather has told me that chess masters who learned from a young age, aside from the immortals atop the mountain, are usually most formidable in their youth, around the age of twenty. But once they pass thirty, age becomes a burden.”

The girl scoffed, “Grandfather was referring to those destined to become prodigies in the chess world. The average person does not fall into that category.”

The elderly gentleman contemplated for a moment. Despite his great skill and reputation in the kingdom, he felt no urgency to make a move. Playing against a stranger made him cautious. He looked up at the two youngsters and frowned.

The boy laughed, “I know, watching the game in silence.”

As the game progressed, both the young lad and the girl exchanged glances.

It turned out the young man had only memorized some opening moves and was playing poorly.

Not to mention the grandfather, even the two of them could easily outplay him with a few pieces advantage.

The elder endured a chuckle.

Truth be told, he didn’t care much about the young man’s skills; he remained patient and continued his game with the green-robed youth.

During the plum rain season, encountering a fellow chess player on the road was already a stroke of luck.

The young man raised his head to glance at the curtain of rain outside the pavilion and conceded the game.

The elder nodded, assisting in the replay of the game. This traveling youth in the green robe had shown considerable skill at the opening, prompting the elder to regard him more highly, almost mistaking him for a true master. However, he quickly ran out of steam and lost, which was quite a pity. 

While they reviewed the game, they engaged in casual conversation. The young man introduced himself as Chen, hailing from the south. He was traveling north to the Kingdom of Lüying, located at the eastern mouth of the Great Lake, and then planned to explore the upper reaches of the lake.

The elder, who introduced himself as Sui, had retired from official duties and was heading to the capital of the Great Seal, where the emperor of the Great Seal’s Zhou clan was hosting a ten-year chess tournament. Chess masters from numerous nations, including Wuling and Jinfei, were invited to test their skills. The Zhou emperor was offering not only a set of invaluable writing supplies as prizes but also a coveted chess manual, which would be awarded to the champion.

Chen Ping’an asked, “When does this tournament begin and end?”

Sui’s grandson, a handsome young man, spoke up eagerly, “It starts at the beginning of autumn. At that time, chess masters from various nations will gather in the capital, and under the arrangements of the Great Seal’s Chess Saint Wei and his three disciples, they will select seed players. The first three rounds will be free, while the other players will draw lots to face off, narrowing it down to a hundred players. Starting on the day of the winter solstice, the real contest among the masters will take place. During this time, the capital will receive its first snow, and only ten players will remain. The prizes from the Zhou emperor will be awarded to these players, but their rankings still need to be determined. The top five will have the opportunity to play a game against the Chess Saint, and by sheer luck, even if they lose, they can still advance to the next round.”

Chen Ping’an inquired, “Is the Chess Saint Wei significantly stronger than everyone else?”

The handsome young man nodded, “Of course! The Chess Saint is the national protector of the Great Seal, unrivaled in skill. My grandfather was fortunate enough to play a game against him twenty years ago but unfortunately lost to one of the Chess Saint's young disciples and didn’t rank in the top three. It’s not that my grandfather’s skill was lacking; that young disciple was extraordinarily talented, with about seventy percent of the Chess Saint’s teachings at the age of thirteen or fourteen. Ten years ago, during the last tournament, the Chess Saint's top disciple didn't participate due to seclusion, or else he wouldn’t have allowed the notorious Chu Yao from Lanfang to take the top position. That tournament was the most boring one ever; many top players didn’t attend, including my grandfather.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Can practitioners from the mountains participate as well?”

The matter of playing chess was indeed significant.

There was a world of difference between those from the mountains and those from the mundane realm.

Typically, the so-called national masters and chess experts from the secular dynasties stood little chance against genuine masters of the chess path from the mountains. The most frightening part was that some exquisite opening strategies from the mundane realm were often unrecognized by mountain practitioners, and the way these mountain cultivators resolved complex chess problems often left others feeling bewildered.

Elder Sui laughed, “For one, mountain immortals are seldom seen by us ordinary scholars. Moreover, even fewer cultivators enjoy playing chess. Hence, in past tournaments in the Great Seal capital, practitioners from the mountain were very few. Although the Chess Saint's disciple is also a cultivator, he plays very quickly, likely to avoid taking undue advantage. I was fortunate enough to play against him once, and it was almost as soon as I made my move that he would follow up immediately, quite straightforwardly. Even so, I still lost with great respect.”

Chen Ping’an asked, “Elder Sui, have you heard any unusual news from the Great Seal capital recently?”

The elder looked puzzled and shook his head, smiling, “I would love to hear more.”

Chen Ping’an chuckled, “It’s just some rumors from the rivers and lakes, saying that there has been persistent flooding outside the Great Seal capital.”

The young man’s expression turned skeptical, “Are they referring to the Yuxi River? What’s there to worry about? With the Chess Saint protecting the country, even if there are some strange floods, how could they possibly flood the capital? Even if there were really some aquatic monsters at work, I don’t think the Chess Saint would need to intervene. That master of swordsmanship should just take a trip to the Yuxi River, and peace would be restored.”

Chen Ping’an smiled, “It’s better to be cautious. Elder Sui, are you headed to the capital for a specific treasure from the emperor’s collection?”

The elder shook his head, “This tournament is gathering many experts, unlike the previous two sessions. While I have a small reputation in my country, I know I won’t make it to the top ten. Thus, my trip to the Great Seal capital is merely to meet old friends and enjoy some tea, and perhaps buy some newly published chess manuals. I would be more than satisfied with that.”

The previously quiet veiled woman spoke softly, “Father, I think this young man is right. The flooding of the Yuxi River is quite strange. If the Chess Saint and the Martial Goddess can easily resolve it, why has it dragged on this long? I fear the Yuxi River may have significant troubles, but the Zhou emperor, for the sake of face, might be unwilling to cancel the tournament. If something unexpected happens then…”

She didn’t continue, knowing that if her father insisted on continuing, her words might seem ominous. 

In truth, she had been hesitant about going to the Great Seal capital since the beginning. The elder was determined not to miss the event. To ease the worries of his family’s younger generation, he had invited a close friend from the rivers and lakes, a renowned martial artist, to provide protection. This friend was a well-known figure in the Wuling martial world, and he promised to look after them throughout the journey. The man with the sword was named Hu Xinfeng, and he intended to escort them to the capital, then visit a few friends in the Kingdom of Jinfei during the tournament.

The tournament in the Great Seal capital was a grand event held every ten years. Not only was it a thrilling showdown among national masters, but the betting frenzy that swept through the city’s streets was equally captivating. Nobles and affluent merchants alike loved to wager on the outcomes, while the common folk, enjoying small bets for entertainment, often placed a few taels of silver on the street corners. It wasn’t uncommon for middle-class families to bet tens or hundreds of taels. Many temples and Daoist establishments in the capital attracted nobility and scholars from far and wide, who, unable to directly spend money, would wager exquisite items, later selling them for a profit.

The girl pouted, “Auntie, if we don’t go to the Great Seal capital, would that mean we’ve taken such a long detour for nothing, over a thousand miles?”

The girl had her own motives. She wished to see the young disciple of the Great Seal's national master, who had once defeated her grandfather. This young disciple, now just over twenty, was said to be stunningly beautiful, with two of the Zhou princes vying for her attention. Some of her friends, who shared an interest in chess, hoped she could witness the beauty of this young celestial figure for herself. She had already boasted that at the upcoming tournament, she would find an opportunity to speak with the celestial being.

The man with the sword remained by the pavilion’s entrance, dutifully watching over the elder with unwavering dedication. It was no small task for a martial artist to serve as a companion to a retired official, spending nearly half a year on such a journey. Hu Xinfeng turned and smiled, “There have been some strange rumors about the Yuxi River outside the Great Seal capital in recent years. Although we can’t be sure, Miss Sui has a point. We should indeed be cautious.”

The elder felt conflicted.

If even a martial hero like Hu Xinfeng was sounding alarms, it was hard not to feel anxious. Yet, the thought of turning back now was equally unsatisfactory.

The woman with the veil sighed softly, feeling a sense of unease. Regarding this journey to the Great Seal capital with her father and niece and nephew, she had consulted divination multiple times. The results were odd, warning of great dangers intertwined with fortunes, making it difficult to grasp the deeper meaning. Logically, one would assume that the Great Seal dynasty had been peaceful for many years, with its national strength flourishing, rivaling the Great View dynasty to the south. The two royal families were even related by marriage. With the Martial Goddess and the national protector present in the capital, even if there were peculiar rumors surrounding the Yuxi River, there shouldn’t be any significant troubles. While she believed that a river without a water god or shrine could indeed harbor a black dragon, she couldn’t believe that a mere water dragon could disrupt the Great Seal capital.

Ultimately, she felt a twinge of regret for having relied on a simple book left behind by a master over the years. Without a proper mentor to guide her, she had floundered in her attempts to practice immortal techniques. Otherwise, she would have already known whether to go or stay regarding the Great Seal capital.

The young man grinned.

His aunt was indeed a remarkable individual. It was said that after his grandmother carried her for ten months, one day in a dream, a divine being entered the ancestral hall holding a child, personally handing her over. Thus, she was born. His aunt was exceptionally talented, excelling in various arts since childhood. In her youth, a wandering master had passed through their home and gifted her three golden hairpins and a garment named “Bamboo Robe,” claiming it was a sign of her destined path. After the master departed, as his aunt matured into a stunning beauty, her fame rose within Wuling, especially in literary circles. However, she faced many obstacles in marriage. His grandfather had attempted to match her with two suitors—one was a well-matched candidate, a top scholar in Wuling who was soon embroiled in scandal and thus failed to marry. The second suitor was a more rugged figure from the martial world, but on the brink of their wedding, his family encountered misfortune, and the young hero disappeared into the world, rumored to be adventuring in Lanfang and Qingci, and still had not married, though he remained fond of her.

Now over thirty, his aunt remained as beautiful as ever, like a fairy stepping out from a mural.

If not for her long years of seclusion and rarely showing herself, even when she did visit temples and shrines, she would choose days when crowds were less, or simply engage with a few select cultured guests through poetry and chess. The young man was confident that even at her age, prospects would line up at her door if she were more visible.

The handsome young man had a different yearning regarding the journey to the Great Seal capital. Besides hosting the chess tournament, the Great Seal dynasty was also set to unveil the top ten martial heroes and four great beauties. Those listed would be received by the Zhou emperor and offered generous gifts. Perhaps the capital was already bustling with many newly ranked young masters. Every decade brought new rankings as some old faces would be pushed off the list while new ones emerged, drawing significant bets in the Great Seal capital.

Though the young man hailed from a scholarly family and was expected to follow the path laid out by his grandfather and elders to become a civil official in Wuling, deep down, he yearned for the chivalry of the martial world. He had hidden dozens of novels about martial heroes in his study, having read them to the point of memorization. He idolized someone like Uncle Hu, a figure who had made a name for himself in the martial world, and if not for Hu Xinfeng already having a wife and children, he would have tried to match him with his aunt.

Noticing Elder Sui’s expression, it seemed he still leaned towards going to the Great Seal capital, so Chen Ping’an refrained from saying more.

As their review of the game concluded, the rain stopped just in time.

However, the road outside was muddy, and aside from Chen Ping’an, the others in the pavilion were lost in their thoughts, not in a hurry to continue their journey.

Chen Ping’an had already put away the chessboard and jars, placing them back in the bamboo box. Holding his travel staff and donning his conical hat, he prepared to take his leave.

After catching a glimpse of the rain curtain and conceding the game, the skies had cleared just as he was ready to depart. 

This was another silent reminder from Chen Ping’an. Whether the veiled woman could notice the subtle hints was up to her.

The man with the sword was a martial artist of the fifth realm and was likely a master in Wuling's martial world.

As for the veiled woman, she seemed to be a half-hearted cultivator, not particularly advanced, perhaps only at the second or third realm.

Just as Chen Ping’an stepped outside the pavilion, he frowned.

What a coincidence!

What was a martial artist at the Golden Body realm doing riding a horse on this remote mountain road? Considering Elder Sui’s standing, it seemed unlikely he had any deadly enemies or rivals in the martial world.

In the vast territory of the Great Seal dynasty and its surrounding nations, similar to Lanfang and Wuling, one might hardly find a Golden Body martial artist stationed there. It was akin to the central regions of Baoping Continent, where the countries of Caiyi and Shushui mostly had peak martial artists in the sixth realm, capable of dominating their local martial worlds. However, the mountain folk often encountered genuine practitioners while the commoners did not, and it was only because Chen Ping’an's cultivation level was high enough that he could perceive more cultivators, pure martial artists, and supernatural beings, unlike in his hometown when he was just a mere apprentice, where he only noted who was rich or poor.

Yet soon, the martial artist halted his horse at a distance, seemingly waiting for someone.

Beside him, there should be another rider, a practitioner.

Then, from the other direction of the tea-horse road, a disorganized clamor of footsteps approached, roughly a dozen people, with varying levels of skill.

Chen Ping’an hesitated, extending a leg to step into the mud, pulling his boot from the muck and wiping it against the step. With a sigh, he returned to the pavilion, saying helplessly, “Let’s sit a while longer and let the sun dry the road; otherwise, it will be uncomfortable traveling.”

The young boy, carefree and optimistic, enjoying his first journey through the martial world, remarked with a laugh, “Clever!”

Chen Ping’an smiled in return.

Hu Xinfeng felt a bit helpless, knowing he had to talk to this kid about being less reckless in the martial world.

Unexpectedly, the veiled woman began to lecture, “As a scholar, you should not be so rude. Apologize to Young Master Chen!”

The boy quickly looked to his grandfather, who chuckled, “Is it hard for a scholar to apologize? Is the wisdom of the sages in books more precious than your pride?”

The boy, unfazed, grinned widely and bowed to the traveler in the conical hat. The traveling scholar simply smiled and stood in place, not offering any polite refusals.

The girl stifled a giggle, finding it amusing to see her mischievous brother humbled.

Elder Sui laughed, “Young Master, we shall continue our journey.”

Chen Ping’an nodded with a smile, “If fate allows, we shall meet again.”

However, just as they prepared to leave the pavilion and retrieve their horses, they saw a group of martial artists rushing toward them, marching forward with muddy splashes.

Hu Xinfeng stood firm, not mounting his horse, and discreetly gestured to the others not to rush to mount, to avoid any chance of looking down on others.

Half of the group of wanderers passed by the pavilion and continued forward. Suddenly, a burly man with an open collar brightened at the sight and exclaimed loudly, “Brothers, let’s take a break!”

The veiled woman frowned.

Hu Xinfeng whispered, “Just give them space and try not to stir up trouble.”

Elder Sui nodded, and the young boy and girl moved closer to him.

The traveler in the conical hat seemed to share the same sentiment, not daring to linger in the pavilion any longer; he sidestepped and moved to the other end of the steps, allowing the pavilion to open up for this group of martial artists, who looked anything but righteous.

Yet even with the cautious green-robed youth, who had taken great care to avoid trouble, he was still unintentionally bumped by four or five men entering the pavilion simultaneously, one of whom deliberately swayed and nudged his shoulder.

The young scholar stumbled back, apologizing profusely, but the burly youth rubbed his shoulder and angrily retorted, “With all this space, it’s not just two legs that can walk here. Even if you had twenty, there’d still be enough room for everyone! You blind or just looking for trouble? Or did you think you could bully me just because there are women around and wanted to show off your heroism?”

The traveler’s bamboo box and chess jars clinked together as he stumbled back, his face turning pale as he continued to apologize, stepping aside to let the group pass.

The burly youth, with a face full of brutish features, moved forward and pushed the young scholar on the shoulder, causing him to fall into the mud outside the pavilion.

The young scholar, terrified, glanced at the group gathered at the steps, but Elder Sui sighed and turned away, ignoring the scene. The boy and girl’s faces turned ashen, and Hu Xinfeng frowned, while the veiled woman hesitated, but Elder Sui’s gaze warned her against intervening. After all, Hu Xinfeng had worked hard over the years to finally associate with someone of noble status, and it wouldn’t do to provoke unnecessary trouble.

Looking at this gang of ruffians, it was evident they were not from Wuling, and Hu Xinfeng’s reputation might not hold sway over them.

Hu Xinfeng felt a heavy heart.

Though these men appeared to be lowly martial thugs, they were not as they seemed. If trouble arose, it could turn serious. Among them was an elder with a scarred face, who Hu Xinfeng recognized as Yang Yuan, a notorious rogue from the Kingdom of Jinfei, known as the "Whirling River Flood Dragon." This man was exceptionally skilled, having once been a top villain in Jinfei’s green forest. He had been on the run for over a decade and had formed a band of ruthless outlaws near the borders of Qingci and Lanfang.

If this were indeed the old rogue Yang Yuan, even if he had been severely wounded before and aged over the years, Hu Xinfeng might not be able to match him if the man had gathered strength during his time of hiding.

Hu Xinfeng had initially worried that Elder Sui, being the scholar he was, might insist on stepping in, but it seemed he had overthought it. Despite not revealing Yang Yuan’s identity, Elder Sui had no intention of involving himself.

It was indeed the notorious Yang Yuan!

The hardened elder looked toward Hu Xinfeng, who hesitated before clasping his fists, “I am Hu Xinfeng, leader of the Wuling Crossing Gang. Greetings, fellow wanderers.”

Yang Yuan considered this and then rasped a laugh, “Never heard of it.”

The others burst into laughter.

Yang Yuan cast a glance at the veiled woman, his murky eyes suddenly sparkling with interest before he turned to the burly youth beside him and said, “Let’s not always resort to violence when we walk the world. Accidental collisions like this can be resolved with a little compensation.”

The burly man paused, and a young man with a sword at his back, holding a folding fan, smiled, “Let’s say fifty or sixty taels will suffice. No need to be difficult with a down-on-his-luck scholar.”

The young scholar, still seated in the mud, panicked, “I don’t have that much silver! There’s only a chessboard and some jars in my box, worth maybe ten taels.”

The young swordsman shook his fan, “That complicates things.”

The handsome young man wanted to speak up but was seized by Elder Sui’s arm, who shot him a fierce glare.

The boy was startled by his grandfather's unfamiliar look and fell silent.

Elder Sui quickly glanced at the unfortunate scholar and noted thankfully that he didn’t seem to be looking to him for help. Otherwise, if trouble escalated, he would have to scold him, which would tarnish his kind and gentle image before his younger relatives.

For reasons unclear, the re-emerged rogue Yang Yuan waved his hand, his voice still raspy, “Let it go. Just give him a scare and let the scholar leave. This kid has some spirit and honor, far better than some cowardly scholars. Let’s not say anything about righteousness; we just don’t want to attract trouble. If I had a knife in hand and fewer witnesses, I might just end that young scholar right here for peace's sake.”

The burly youth looked disappointed, pretending to kick, as the young scholar scrambled to his feet and fled, splashing through the mud.

Elder Sui remained calm.

The handsome young man flushed red, feeling embarrassed at the implications of the rogue’s words.

As the veiled woman noticed the young scholar pausing at the end of the path, he turned to look back and flashed a glance that might have been a smile, then strode off.

At the entrance of the pavilion, Yang Yuan pointed at the young man with the fan and turned to the veiled woman, “This is my beloved disciple, still unmarried. Although you’re veiled and styled as a woman, it matters not. My disciple isn’t picky about such things. Today is as good a day as any for us to become in-laws. Rest assured, though we may be wanderers, our family wealth is substantial. The betrothal gifts will be more generous than those given by the children of nobility. If you don’t believe me, you can ask your sword-wielding companion; he should recognize my identity.”

Elder Sui’s expression darkened.

Hu Xinfeng felt awkward and, after gathering his thoughts, spoke up, “Elder Sui, this Yang Yuan is a martial master from the Kingdom of Jinfei.”

The young man trembled, his voice barely above a whisper, “Yang Yuan, the Whirling River Flood Dragon? Wasn’t he killed by the esteemed Lin Shu of the Zhengrong Sect?”

Though the boy thought his voice was too soft to be heard, it was clear to Hu Xinfeng and Yang Yuan, both masters in the martial world.

Hu Xinfeng turned angrily, “Sui Wenfa, don’t spout nonsense! Quickly apologize to Elder Yang!”

The handsome young man bowed again.

This was the second time he had apologized today.

Yang Yuan extended a hand, smiling, “Let’s go inside and talk. I hope the esteemed elder from the Wuling kingdom can show me some respect.”

Elder Sui felt a bit relieved. As long as things didn’t escalate into violence, that was good enough. He had read plenty about gruesome scenes in stories, but he had never witnessed one firsthand.

Since the other party had recognized his identity and addressed him as the elder, there might be a chance for resolution.

 # Chapter 610: Scholars, Jianghu People, and Beauties (Part 2)

The two parties sat opposite each other on the long bench under the pavilion wall. Only the elder Yang Yuan and his sword-wielding disciple faced the entrance, with the old man leaning forward, his body slightly bent as he clenched his fists. He bore no resemblance to a fierce Jianghu villain; instead, he smiled at the silent woman in the veil and the girl beside her. The elder spoke pleasantly, “If the esteemed Su Old Minister does not mind, it would be even better to deepen the connection. I still have a clever grandson at home. He just turned sixteen this year. Though he didn’t accompany me on my travels through Jianghu, he is well-read and a true scholar, not just someone who talks nonsense. This year, during the imperial examination in Lanfang Kingdom, my grandson earned second place as a Jinshi. His name is Yang Rui; perhaps the esteemed Su Old Minister has heard of him.” 

Then the elder turned to his disciple with a smile, “I wonder which young lady my Rui’er will take a liking to. Fu Zhen, who do you think he might choose? Will it conflict with you?”

The sword-wielding disciple quickly replied, “It would be better for someone older to be a wife, and the younger ones to be concubines.” 

The elder frowned. “That would be contrary to propriety.” 

The disciple chuckled, “In Jianghu, we don’t need to worry so much about etiquette. If it comes to it, these two young ladies could always change their names. Marrying Yang Rui, who is talented and handsome with a good family background, is a huge blessing. They should be satisfied. If it weren’t for the lack of suitable princesses or county lords in Lanfang, he would already be a prince consort.” 

Hu Xinfeng suppressed his anger and retorted, “Elder Yang, don’t forget, we are in Wuling Kingdom!” 

Yang Yuan laughed, “If Wuling’s top person, Wang Dun, were here, I wouldn’t even enter this pavilion. Coincidentally, Wang Dun should currently be in the capital of Dazhuan. Of course, with our large group swaggering through, should someone die, those experienced constables in Wuling would surely find some traces. But that’s fine; when the time comes, the esteemed Su Old Minister will help clean up the mess. Scholars value their reputation most; family disgrace should not be aired in public.” 

Hu Xinfeng sighed and turned to the elder with the surname Su, “What do you say?” 

The elder looked at the formidable old man, sneering, “I don’t believe you, Yang Yuan, can truly act lawlessly in our Wuling Kingdom.” 

Yang Yuan smiled dismissively and asked Hu Xinfeng, “What do you think, Hero Hu? Are you willing to risk your life and sacrifice your sect and family to protect these two ladies and block our families' union? Or would you rather be smart about it and attend my Rui’er’s wedding as a distinguished guest, presenting a gift of congratulations, and I’ll return a grand gift in return?” 

The sword-wielding disciple chuckled, “Once the rice is cooked, the ladies will be much more agreeable.” 

Yang Yuan nodded with a smile, “Rough words can carry some truth.” 

The elder with the surname Su pleaded, “Hero Hu! In times of danger, don’t abandon us!” 

Hu Xinfeng's expression was complex, caught in a struggle between his thoughts. 

Yang Yuan smiled, “It’s a pity that young scholar isn’t here; otherwise, he would definitely scold you scholars a few times according to your own words. But it’s lucky he isn’t here; otherwise, I would never allow the old family to lose face. If someone dies, so be it. My temper has improved a lot over the years, especially since Rui’er joined the family. I hold great respect for you scholars, regardless of how many classic texts you’ve read.” 

The veiled woman suddenly spoke, “I can stay behind and let them go, then quickly head to Lanfang Kingdom. Even if someone reports to the authorities, as long as we cross the border into Jinfeng Kingdom, it would be meaningless.” 

Yang Yuan shook his head, “That’s the trouble. We came to Wuling Kingdom mainly to find a wife for my Rui’er, but there are still some matters that must be addressed. So, Hero Hu’s decision is crucial.” 

Hu Xinfeng suddenly asked, “Even if I nod in agreement here in this pavilion, would you truly rest easy?” 

Yang Yuan laughed, “Of course not.” 

Hu Xinfeng took a deep breath, twisting at his waist, and delivered a punch straight at the elder with the surname Su. 

Not to mention a frail old man, even an average Jianghu expert would struggle to withstand Hu Xinfeng’s full-powered punch. 

But the next moment, Hu Xinfeng’s punch was halted by a flash of sword light, causing him to suddenly retract his hand. 

It turned out that a sword was positioned horizontally in front of the elder with the surname Su. 

The one wielding the sword was none other than Yang Yuan’s prized disciple, a young swordsman, who stood relaxed with one hand behind his back and the other holding the sword, smiling as he said, “Indeed, the so-called experts of Wuling Kingdom are quite disappointing. Only Wang Dun stands out among the crowd, making it onto the latest top ten list of Dazhuan, even if he’s at the bottom. He is surely far superior to other martial artists in Wuling.” 

Yang Yuan frowned, “Enough of your nonsense.” 

The young man realized he had misspoken, and a flicker of resentment crossed his face. He took a step forward, and the flash of his sword brought a coolness to the already refreshing air of the pavilion after the heavy rain. 

Hu Xinfeng stepped back, angered, “Why is Elder Yang doing this?!” 

Faced with the dazzling sword light crisscrossing the pavilion, Hu Xinfeng still managed to ask, clearly at a disadvantage. 

The young swordsman, having lost a beauty he had never seen but had imagined to be delicate and charming, felt a thrill just from hearing her say one thing. She must be a stunning beauty; even if her looks didn’t match her figure or voice, they couldn’t be far behind, especially since she was a well-bred lady from a scholarly family in Wuling. He assumed there was more to her than met the eye. Unexpectedly, she had been inexplicably given away to that Yang Rui brat. 

The young swordsman had already pent up a great deal of frustration, and now Hu Xinfeng dared to speak, causing him to strike even more fiercely and swiftly. 

The handsome youth, Sui Wenfa, hid behind the elder with the surname Su, while the girl, Sui Wenying, nestled close to her aunt, trembling slightly. 

The veiled woman softly reassured, “Don’t be afraid.” 

Yang Yuan, agile as a monkey, bent down, his toes barely touching the ground, and dashed out. Seizing the opportunity, he landed two heavy punches on Hu Xinfeng’s chest, sending him flying out of the pavilion and crashing hard to the ground, spitting blood and struggling to rise without success. 

Yang Yuan felt a cold laugh in his heart; it was the same as twenty years ago. Even after twenty years, these Jianghu righteous heroes were just as clever, and he had been too foolish back then, leading to a lack of status in the Jianghu of Jinfeng Kingdom. But it was fine; in misfortune, he had found fortune, establishing a thriving new sect on the border of the two countries, and had mingled in the bureaucracy of Lanfang and met two true experts from Qingci Kingdom. 

The young swordsman was about to leap out to land a few strikes on the heart and head of the fallen Hu Xinfeng. 

However, Yang Yuan reached out to stop him. As Hu Xinfeng wiped the blood from his lips, he subtly moved his mouth, and Yang Yuan did the same. 

At that moment, two riders slowly approached from the small path and, upon encountering this “Jianghu dispute,” showed no sign of slowing their horses. 

One rider was a black-clad elder with a saber, and the other was a man in his thirties. 

As the two riders passed the pavilion, the elder didn’t even glance at the crowd, simply urging his horse onward. 

The elder with the surname Su shouted, “Two heroes, help us! I am Su Xinyu, the former Minister of Works of Wuling Kingdom! These villains intend to rob and kill us!” 

The younger man abruptly turned his horse, surprised, “Is that you, Uncle Su?!” 

Su Xinyu, known more for his scholarly reputation and chess skills than for his government service, was momentarily taken aback, then nodded vigorously. 

Yang Yuan chuckled, “Old family, you truly aren’t afraid of harming innocent bystanders. I’m beginning to regret these two marriage proposals. Who knows when you might sell this family off?” 

The young man dismounted and bowed, emotionally saying, “Junior Cao Fu pays his respects to Uncle Su! Back then, I left without saying goodbye to avoid implicating you. I ended up causing trouble for Miss Su.” 

Everyone, except for Yang Yuan and his disciple Fu Zhen, changed their expressions dramatically, fear gripping their hearts. 

Cao Fu was a renowned figure in Lanfang and Qingci Kingdom, having inexplicably transformed from a wandering martial artist to a cherished disciple of a legendary sage on the mountain in Qingci Kingdom. Although the name of a cultivator might not intimidate ordinary people across the dozen nations, those familiar with the Jianghu knew well that any cultivator who could stand firm across such territories, especially those with ancestral halls and legendary masters, was not to be trifled with. 

Over the past decade, Cao Fu had traveled down the mountain multiple times, always accompanied by legendary bodyguards. He rarely fought himself, but his name had spread far and wide, with rumors suggesting that the famous queen of Lanfang once had a senior-apprentice relationship with him. 

As a result, two of the top ten masters and four great beauties recently selected by the Dazhuan Dynasty were connected to Cao Fu—one being the “Yulan Beauty,” his senior apprentice, and the other three were established beauties, including a girl from the northern city of Qingliu, who had become the object of desire for a border general, leading to diplomatic tensions between their kingdoms. 

Among those connected to the extraordinarily fortunate Cao Fu was the legendary protector ranked just above Wang Dun on the Dazhuan list, the swordsman Xiao Shuye, who was rumored to have mastered a magical technique capable of slaying demons. His saber, “Wuxiao,” was a celestial weapon that could slice through iron as if it were mud and was reputed to excel even against the most malevolent of spirits. 

If nothing unexpected happened, the black-clad elder following Cao Fu was undoubtedly Xiao Shuye. 

The girl lifted her head, linking arms with her aunt, and exclaimed, “Aunt, is this the Uncle Cao that Wenfa often talks about?” 

The handsome youth, Sui Wenfa, was even more teary-eyed. He had long admired Uncle Cao’s Jianghu exploits but had never dared to confirm whether he was the same man who nearly married his aunt before experiencing a family downfall. However, he had always hoped that the famous recluse from Lanfang was indeed the Jianghu hero who almost wed his aunt. 

Cao Fu straightened up and helped Hu Xinfeng to his feet. 

Hu Xinfeng forced a smile, “Young Master Cao, it’s my fault. If you hadn’t arrived, I would have paid with my life and still been unable to protect Uncle Su. Once a disaster occurs, a hundred deaths wouldn’t be enough to atone.” 

Cao Fu quickly stepped back and bowed again, “Hero Hu, your noble character deserves my respect.” 

Su Xinyu snorted coldly and waved his sleeve, “Cao Fu, knowing faces but not hearts, Hero Hu almost carelessly killed your Uncle Su during the spar earlier.” 

Cao Fu was taken aback. 

Su Xinyu sighed, “Cao Fu, you’re too kind-hearted and naive. You don’t understand the dangers of Jianghu. Never mind; misfortune reveals friendship. Consider this old man blind for having recognized such a friend like Hero Hu. Hu Xinfeng, you may leave now. My Sui family cannot afford to associate with such a hero, so let’s cease any further personal connections.” 

Hu Xinfeng turned, spitting blood onto the ground, and bowed, “In the future, I, Hu Xinfeng, will surely visit Uncle Su’s residence to apologize.” 

The saber-wielding man pressed his hand to his chest and, with a heavy heart, staggered away, his back appearing pitiful. 

Yang Yuan stood at the pavilion entrance, his expression dark, and said in a low voice, “Cao Fu, don’t think you can rely on your master’s connections. This is Wuling Kingdom, not Lanfang or Qingci.” 

Su Xinyu stroked his beard, smiling, “Those words sound somewhat familiar to me.” 

Yang Yuan’s expression hardened, seemingly suppressing a surge of anger, but he dared not act, which only brought more satisfaction to the elder from Wuling. What a twist of fate; after all, life is unpredictable. 

The girl, Sui Wenying, cuddled against her aunt and covered her mouth, laughing, her crescent-shaped eyes sparkling as she looked at the man called Cao Fu, her spirit swaying, though soon her expression darkened. 

Sui Wenfa’s eyes widened as he stared intently at the man who could be considered his half-uncle. He believed he had to observe this Jianghu hero who seemed to have stepped out of the pages of a book. It was a pity that this refined Uncle Cao wasn’t wielding a sword or saber; otherwise, he would be perfect. 

Cao Fu glanced at the veiled woman, his eyes soft and filled with unexpressed sentiment. Then he turned to Yang Yuan, exuding a different kind of swagger honed by the trials of Jianghu. He took a step back, slightly crouched his knees, and extended a hand, smiling, “Yang Yuan, it’s been many years since I’ve looked for you. Now that we’ve met, how about we spar a few moves?” 

Yang Yuan sneered, “You’re not of the same generation. Let my disciple Fu Zhen spar with you for a few moves. Life and death will be their own concern, with no entanglement of respective masters and seniors. What do you think?” 

Fu Zhen’s mouth twitched. 

Yang Yuan spoke in a deep voice, “Fu Zhen, regardless of victory or defeat, just three moves.” 

Fu Zhen breathed a sigh of relief; thankfully, his master wasn’t pushing him to his demise. 

Fu Zhen took a deep breath and smiled, “Then I shall seek guidance from Master Cao for three moves.” 

After some contemplation, he thrust his sword straight out, stepping forward lightly, like a dragonfly skimming the water, very graceful. 

This sword seemed imposing, yet it held considerable reserve. 

Thinking that at worst, he would suffer a bit under the opponent’s hands and keep his life intact, Fu Zhen quickly regretted his decision. 

The man stepped forward, his head tilted, and just as Fu Zhen hesitated to execute a symbolic horizontal slash, the man had already reached him in an instant. A palm pressed against Fu Zhen’s face with a smile, “Five Thunders True Seal, quickly release the Scarlet Palace.” 

With a thunderous sound, 

It was as if a thunderous explosion erupted against Fu Zhen’s face. 

Fu Zhen, bleeding from all seven orifices, fell dead on the spot, crashing through the pavilion’s entrance wall, vanishing without a trace. 

The sword that slipped from his grip was caught by Cao Fu, who casually swung it, embedding it into the trunk of a large tree. 

The handsome youth, Sui Wenfa, felt a surge of emotions, wiping his face, and truly cried. This was no mere half-uncle; he was the man he admired! He had to learn at least one or two moves from this uncle, ensuring that in the future, his travels for learning would be more fruitful. At the very least, he wouldn’t end up as pitiable as that previous, bumbling green-clad scholar, who had to apologize for being bumped into, and who fell into the mud without daring to utter a harsh word. When escaping, he was quick on his feet, carrying that large green bamboo bookcase—how ludicrous! 

Yang Yuan quickly led his group away from the pavilion, and Cao Fu smiled, asking, “Uncle Su, do you need to stop them?” 

The veiled woman, hidden behind her thin veil, showed little change in expression. 

After considering for a moment, the elder with the surname Su shook his head and smiled, “Forget it; we’ve already taught them a lesson. Let’s hurry away from here; after all, there’s still a corpse behind the pavilion.” 

As for those Jianghu villains who sensed danger and fled, whether they would harm innocent passersby was uncertain. 

The two parties, who had nearly become in-laws years ago, might have an unspoken understanding or perhaps simply failed to consider the other. In any case, they decided not to dwell on it. 

After some conversation, they learned that Cao Fu had just come from Lanfang, Qingci, and Jinfeng and had already visited the Sui family estate in Wuling. Hearing that the elder Su was on his way to the capital of Dazhuan, he had rushed day and night, inquiring for news, and finally encountered them at this ancient tea-horse road pavilion. Cao Fu felt a sense of relief, saying he had come late, and the old minister laughed heartily, saying it was better to arrive at the right time than to arrive early, reassuring him that it was not too late. 

While speaking, the elegant elder glanced at his daughter. Unfortunately, the veiled woman said nothing, and his smile grew deeper, likely because his daughter was shy. 

Cao Fu, a once-in-a-lifetime son-in-law, missing out once was a significant regret. Now, he clearly appeared in fine clothes, remembering his old engagement, which was rare and should not be missed again. The grass and wood gathering at the Dazhuan capital could be skipped; returning home to secure this marriage proposal was of utmost importance. 

The term “Master Cao” used by the former bandit leader Yang Yuan stuck in Su Xinyu’s mind. 

Cao Fu had initially intended to escort the elder to the capital of Dazhuan, expressing a willingness to accompany him but, upon hearing the elder speak of returning home, the distance to the grass and wood gathering was long. Given his frail body, he decided to change his mind and also mentioned that the capital of Dazhuan was currently in chaos due to the Water Flood Dragon, so it might be better not to go. 

As the group exited the pavilion, they mounted their horses and slowly descended the tea-horse ancient road, returning to the county town where the Sui family resided in Wuling Kingdom. They still had a considerable distance to cover and had to pass through the capital region, which made Su Xinyu quite content. He thought it would be nice to take a slight detour and visit some old friends in the capital. 

As the veiled woman mounted her horse, she caught a glimpse of the small path’s end out of the corner of her eye, lost in thought. 

Yang Yuan’s band of Jianghu villains returned along the same path. They either took a small detour to escape or fled hastily; otherwise, if they continued toward the capital of Dazhuan, they might encounter trouble. 

On the way down the mountain, 

After Hu Xinfeng had exited everyone’s sight, he immediately began to sprint. Eventually, he spotted the green-clad scholar with the bamboo hat. Hu Xinfeng felt furious upon seeing this useless person, believing this day’s misfortunes were all his fault. If it weren’t for him stubbornly playing chess in the pavilion with the surname Sui, he could have left earlier or later, and perhaps the situation wouldn’t have turned out like this. 

Now, not only had he angered Su Xinyu, but he also lost the chance to get to know the high-ranking Cao Fu. He feared that the beautiful woman, whom even he dared not have improper thoughts about, might one day whisper sweet nothings into the ear of her long-lost half-husband, Cao Fu, causing him to be inexplicably left with nothing. 

How substantial a loss was this? 

Upon thinking of this, Hu Xinfeng kicked out, striking the weak scholar’s head and sending him tumbling into the dense forest outside the mountain path, disappearing in an instant. 

Only then did Hu Xinfeng feel somewhat better. 

Feeling much more at ease, Hu Xinfeng spat out a mouthful of blood-tinged spit. While it looked concerning, his injury from Yang Yuan’s double punches was not severe. 

However, after walking another half a li, he suddenly widened his eyes, only to see that young scholar with the walking stick ahead again. 

Am I seeing ghosts in broad daylight? 

Hu Xinfeng cautiously picked up a stone and lightly tossed it. 

It struck the young man’s head perfectly. The young man covered his head with his hand and turned, his face filled with rage, scolding, “Is this never-ending?” 

Hu Xinfeng wanted to laugh but suddenly dared not. 

With his heart racing, Hu Xinfeng was about to dash away from this suddenly eerie tea-horse ancient road, but the man instead staggered toward him, rendering Hu Xinfeng momentarily paralyzed. 

His face stiffened. 

The young man adjusted his hat and cheerfully asked, “What’s wrong? Why not take the main road? Not afraid of running into ghosts?” 

Hu Xinfeng swallowed hard and nodded, “I will take the main road, indeed.” 

The two walked slowly together. 

After weighing his options, Hu Xinfeng noticed the man seemed unsteady on his feet, his face pale, and sweat trickling down his forehead. After hesitating, he rapidly gathered his energy and threw a powerful punch at the young man’s temple. 

With a loud bang, 

The young man was sent flying off the tea-horse ancient road. 

Hu Xinfeng rubbed his aching fist, feeling pain; this time, he should be dead beyond saving. 

But after walking another li, the green-clad scholar reappeared in his sight. 

At this moment, Hu Xinfeng was drenched in sweat, his back chilled. 

Fortunately, the young man continued walking toward him, then walked alongside him as they slowly descended the mountain together. 

Hu Xinfeng was drenched in sweat. 

Suddenly, a sound of hoofbeats came from behind. 

Hu Xinfeng abruptly retreated, shouting loudly, “Uncle Sui, Young Master Cao! This person is an accomplice of Yang Yuan!” 

But the rider merely brushed past, no one turning to look at him. 

Hu Xinfeng felt as if struck by lightning. 

The young scholar smiled, “This is a bit awkward.” 

Yet the young scholar suddenly furrowed his brows tightly. 

Among the riders, the veiled woman anxiously called out, “Chen Gongzi, save me!” 

Chen Pingan feigned ignorance, slowing his pace. As he slowed down, Hu Xinfeng followed suit. 

However, the woman was undeterred and, like a madwoman, suddenly turned her horse around, racing against the others, heading straight for the green-clad scholar with the bamboo hat. 

Even Chen Pingan was momentarily stunned. He had seen shameless people before, but he had never seen anyone so brazen. The veiled woman leaped off her horse, landing beside him, then hid behind him and the bookcase, whispering, “Chen Gongzi, I know you are a cultivator; please save me.” 

Chen Pingan turned his head and asked, “Am I your father or grandfather?” 

The young woman suddenly removed her hat, revealing her face, and pleaded, “If you can save me, I will be your benefactor, even if it means...” 

Unexpectedly, the young man slapped her, sending her tumbling several times before she fell to the ground, leaving her dazed. 

The young man said, “I’ve been tolerating your family for quite some time.” 

But the next moment, he sighed, facing her and the weak Hu Xinfeng, and conjured a jade bamboo folding fan from thin air, smiling, “Forgive me for being rude, forgive me for being rude.”
