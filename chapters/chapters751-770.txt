 ### Chapter 751: The Great Craftsman's Heir

Chen Pingan discussed the matter of overcoming obstacles with the sword cultivators of the Hidden Officials lineage. The sword cultivators understood the principle well, but Chen Pingan provided an example that even the sorrowful Miao Sword Immortal found enlightening.

In the realm of Qingming, the Grand Master of Baiyu City, Lu Chen, once visited the hometown of the young Hidden Official. Disguised, he set up a fortune-telling stall in the Liuzhu Cave Heaven, where he stayed for over a decade.

Under the suppression of the Great Dao from the Haoran world, he had remained at the Ascended Realm for a long time.

Wang Xinshui felt a bit resentful towards the Hidden Official. Why hadn’t such astonishing tales been mentioned earlier? If he had known sooner, his admiration for the Hidden Official would have elevated him to the Ascended Realm long ago, rather than being stuck at the bottleneck of the Nascent Soul Realm.

Among the latest group of six who were closely aligned with the young Hidden Official on a small mountain peak, Guo Zhujiu held the highest cultivation level, making her the standard by which others were measured in terms of comprehension and achievement. Even Guke Long’s fair comments surprised Guo Zhujiu, indicating that her cultivation was not low, reaching the Immortal Realm, second only to her.

Xuan Can, due to his experience with chess, gained a powerful technique akin to a supreme secret manual that allowed him to advance to the Jade Purity Realm, with the Great Dao within reach. Cao Gun, who had come to the mountain to learn this path, started too late and lacked diligence, remaining at the Golden Core Realm. Wang Xinshui was at the Nascent Soul bottleneck, while Mi Yu, the Sword Immortal, displayed poor talent and lack of sincerity, not even qualifying as an Earth Immortal.

Today, Chen Pingan went out for a stroll again. Guo Zhujiu finished her tasks and adjusted the position of a small snowman on the table, patting its head before hoisting her small bamboo box and dashing out.

With her gaze and encouragement, dubbed “from little Guo Zhujiu,” the snowman looked at her, filled with care and motivation. The bamboo branch in its hand pointed assertively. Who dared to slack off? The bamboo branch would act like a flying sword, and one had to be careful about their head.

Her master was still walking slowly today, and Guo Zhujiu caught up with him after just a few steps.

“Master, why are you walking so slowly lately? Are you in meditation?” Guo Zhujiu asked.

Chen Pingan smiled, “Yes, I’m cultivating my heart.”

The little girl spun around, always facing her master. “This grand knowledge of heaven and earth, I don’t need to learn it, right? Even if I wanted to, I couldn't learn it?”

Chen Pingan replied, “Anyone can learn it, but there’s no need to.”

The little girl felt both happy and troubled.

In a secluded courtyard, Chen Pingan pulled out one horizontal river water talisman and one earth-absorbing soil talisman. “Master will draw you a map of the Haoran world.”

On the ground, each continent he mentioned was accompanied by stories about its customs and cultures, some witnessed firsthand, others noted in books or heard through discussions.

There was the Southeast Tongye Continent, the Eastern Baoping Continent from his master’s hometown, the Northern Julu Continent where most sword cultivators traveled along the Sword Qi Great Wall, the Aihai Continent, the origin of the Snowflake Coins, the flourishing Buddhist Northwest Liuxia Continent, the ancient battlefield remnants of the Western Golden Armor Continent, the currently chaotic Southwestern Fuyiao Continent, and the Southern Posha Continent where the Chen family, known for their scholarly pursuits, resided.

Lin Junbi's hometown was the Central Land Divine Continent.

Guo Zhujiu squatted in the corridor, gazing at the map, exclaiming, “The heavens are round and the earth is flat. If this isn’t round heaven and flat earth, then it’s easier for you to travel from your hometown, Baoping Continent, to the Golden Armor Continent without taking such a long detour.”

Chen Pingan chuckled, “Because all the worlds and all the blessed lands are a fragmented new map. If they were all found, combined with the newly discovered fifth world by the Confucian saints, perhaps it would resemble a grand round heaven and small earth, much like circles within circles, or moons within moons.”

During their journey to the Daxu Mountain Academy, Little Baoping had once posed this question, answered at the time by the seemingly omniscient Cui Dongshan.

Cui Dongshan had taken out a water bowl, a freshly plucked green branch, and a random stone, asking everyone what they felt about heaven and earth.

Unfortunately, at that moment, the rice was cooked, and the fish was fragrant, so no one paid him any mind.

Cui Dongshan tossed the stone, inserted the branch into the back of his collar, poured water into the bowl, and requested a bowl of rice from Chen Pingan.

Chen Pingan mentioned he needed to find the dazed Pang Yuanji, and Guo Zhujiu immediately sprang up, calling out that she understood and hurried away.

Guo Zhujiu returned to the main hall, where the atmosphere remained somewhat heavy and tense.

It was bearable when her master was present.

However, when he was absent, it became even more suffocating.

Guo Zhujiu set down her bamboo box at her feet.

After the incident, Lin Junbi questioned the Hidden Official whether the tale of the Ascended Realm great demon being slain outside the Inverted Mountain could be shared with all the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Otherwise, over time, with people's hearts fluctuating like the tides, if it were to burst like a dam, it could easily affect the overall situation.

But Chen Pingan merely stated it was unnecessary and that they could wait a little longer.

The rampant discussions targeted only him, the Hidden Official, not the sword cultivators of the entire lineage, which made it less significant for the time being.

Pang Yuanji sat on a railing in a corridor, lost in thought, heavy-hearted, with nothing to say.

Hearing footsteps, he turned his head, nodded as a greeting.

However, Pang Yuanji waited for a long time before the fellow finally sat beside him.

It seemed lately, every time Chen Pingan left the main hall, it was just for a stroll, moving at the same slow pace.

Chen Pingan sat next to him, handing over a jug of wine. “This is the fairy wine brewed at Chunfan Studio, quite expensive, and its taste rivals that of the bamboo sea cave wine.”

Pang Yuanji shook his head, “No thanks, I haven’t drunk in a long time.”

Chen Pingan looked at this scruffy-faced fellow and said, “You should speak some words that ease your heart; there’s no need to hold back. I know you have grievances against me, but if you feel it’s unreasonable, you can just endure it. However, that’s not necessary. Can you brew fine wine by storing up sorrow like a wine barrel?”

Pang Yuanji replied, “You should have explored the corners of both the Summer Palace and Winter Palace, right?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “Of course, but unfortunately, there weren’t any hidden mechanisms to uncover unexpected treasures.”

Pang Yuanji spoke softly, “But you would never feel what I feel. It's not just now that I feel this way; I realized it shortly after entering the old Hidden Official lineage.”

“What feeling? Tell me about it.”

Chen Pingan unsealed the jar of wine mud, took a sip, and said, “I’ll just drink and listen to your complaints. No need to reason; sometimes, venting emotions itself is a form of reasoning.”

Pang Yuanji’s expression turned dazed as he muttered, “In two houses, is there anything superfluous? Any trivial decorative items? There’s nothing. When my master left the Sword Qi Great Wall, the ‘Hidden Official’ jade token was left behind, all the secret records remained, and I was left here alone. I only feel like my master never came to this Summer Palace in her life. Recently, I’ve been thinking about what my master thinks or does when she’s alone. Does she also feel sad and disappointed but can’t speak to anyone? Everyone thinks my master must always be powerful and invincible, slaying demons time and again, but I never felt that way.”

At this point, Pang Yuanji glanced at the city wall, recalling his master, Xiao Xian, and unconsciously thought of the old Sword Immortal.

The two Hidden Official palaces were so desolate; how much more so for the old Sword Immortal living in a thatched cottage?

It seemed hardly anyone on the Sword Qi Great Wall had thought deeply about what the old Sword Immortal might think or feel.

Chen Pingan looked around and nodded, “Hearing you say this, I realize the house is indeed empty, which indicates your master, Xiao Xian, is incredible. Only someone with a powerful and self-sufficient heart would be indifferent to external possessions. You can’t do it, and of course, I can’t either.”

In fact, Chen Pingan was more sensitive to the feelings of a stranger in an unfamiliar environment than to a particular stranger.

But such conversations couldn’t be pursued.

Pang Yuanji’s eyes reddened as he raised his head, taking a deep breath, and forced a smile. “I thought you would scold my master, at least berate me severely.”

After all, Pang Yuanji’s master had nearly killed this young Hidden Official’s brother in battle.

And she had attacked in the most dishonorable way.

Self-mockery at one’s most sorrowful moment serves as a form of subconscious self-protection.

Chen Pingan shook his head, sipping the wine, “If I were to speak lofty principles, I wouldn’t have enough baskets to hold all the words. How can I criticize you two as master and disciple? It’s pointless. One must be tolerant of others’ selfishness; otherwise, in the end, it’s oneself who grows weary. Why bother?”

Chen Pingan continued, “Without discussing Xiao Xian’s eventual betrayal, you know well the many things she did for the Sword Qi Great Wall, as do I. As for why she betrayed, I might understand it better than you because I’m an observer. It’s just that presently and in the future, many sword immortals and cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall choose to forget, some intentionally, some unwittingly, and very few understand yet don’t accept it. So I guess this is your most frustrating part?”

Pang Yuanji remained silent.

Chen Pingan took a large gulp of wine and smiled, “Indeed, even with those selfish thoughts, Pang Yuanji, you still do the work of the new Hidden Official lineage’s sword cultivators, not falling behind anyone else. In terms of affairs, you owe the Sword Qi Great Wall nothing; in terms of feelings, you have not wronged the master-disciple bond. What else can you expect from Pang Yuanji to be seen as doing well?”

Thus, Chen Pingan did not think that Pang Yuanji’s path of cultivation had reached a dead end due to an unstable sword heart.

Pang Yuanji forced a smile and said, “Even if you say that, my heart doesn’t feel any better.”

Chen Pingan said, “I’ll ask you one last question; you don’t have to answer.”

Pang Yuanji didn’t want to hear this question, which would certainly be troubling.

Chen Pingan asked, “If after Xiao Xian threw that punch, hypothetically, you could kill her right away, what would Pang Yuanji do?”

Pang Yuanji instinctively crossed his arms, shoulders slumped, and remained silent.

Chen Pingan chuckled, “Since it’s all painful anyway, might as well make you feel a bit worse.”

Pang Yuanji wanted to say that the Hidden Official could continue being busy with his own matters.

To his surprise, the man continued, “How about I ask you another question?”

Pang Yuanji asked, “If I don’t provide an answer, will you keep asking?”

Chen Pingan drank his wine, oblivious, and asked, “I heard that Lin Junbi’s senior brother at the border is actually an Ascended Realm great demon. Deep down, does it make you feel a little better? Or would you feel even worse realizing this because you are friends with Lin Junbi?”

Pang Yuanji’s face was filled with bitterness.

Chen Pingan patted Pang Yuanji’s shoulder, “You just have to endure; there’s no escaping. You can close the door and avoid people, but how can your true self not meet?”

Who hasn’t got a few principles on their lips? It’s easiest to deceive oneself in this world.

Chen Pingan didn’t push further, taking another large sip of wine, ready to let Pang Yuanji enjoy his solitude.

Pang Yuanji turned and asked, “Chen Pingan, why do I feel like you’re relishing my misfortune?”

Chen Pingan was surprised, “You can tell? I’m not particularly skilled at many things, but hiding my true feelings is something I excel at. Brother Pang, you have good insight.”

Pang Yuanji asked, “Is it true?”

Chen Pingan retorted, “What’s true or false? In this matter, we are both in the same boat. Otherwise, why do you think I’m here drinking with you, making you feel uncomfortable so that I can feel good?”

Pang Yuanji sighed, feeling weak, “I ask you to just go away.”

Chen Pingan jumped off the railing, laughing, “Talking to the Hidden Official like this is a one-time thing, a rare exception. It’s not good to bully honest folks.”

Pang Yuanji suddenly said, “Chen Pingan, I’m not going to kill demons on the city walls.”

In the corridor, Chen Pingan turned around and chuckled, “As long as you’re not afraid of the scorn and gossip from outside, then you don’t need to worry about anything from me. The new Hidden Official lineage doesn’t mandate that sword cultivators must leave the city to slay demons.”

Pang Yuanji’s expression was miserable as he replied, “Truly, we are kindred spirits.”

Chen Pingan smiled, “When can you learn from Lin Junbi, endure on your own, and find joy in hardship? That would be a sign of successful heart cultivation.”

Pang Yuanji remained lost in thought.

The questions between the Barbarian World and the Sword Qi Great Wall continued.

However, during this time, the Barbarian World did something apart from asking swords. The peak great demon, Yangzhi, the crowned woman in a dragon robe, returned to the battlefield, hovering high in the air, holding a half-dead man, a sword immortal who had blocked a large army’s northward advance in the heart of the Barbarian World. Both Yangzhi and her peer Huang Luan achieved their own victories, but the two sword immortals Huang Luan killed had turned to dust, their souls scattered, while Yangzhi had captured one alive.

On that day in battle, Yangzhi gripped the dying sword immortal’s head with her five fingers, standing not far from two torrents of sword energy, revealing the sword immortal’s background and what actions he had carried out in the Barbarian World. Then, under everyone’s gaze, Yangzhi slowly stripped the flesh from that sword immortal, the process painstakingly slow, starting with the flesh, followed by shattering bones, then extracting a golden core, piece by piece, grinding it away until the Nascent Soul was finally strangled, and ultimately, she extracted and shattered the sword immortal’s soul.

After Yangzhi appeared, the Hidden Official lineage’s flying swords sent messages to all parts of the Sword Qi Great Wall, and it was the flying sword inscribed with “Hidden Official.”

No sword immortal or cultivator was permitted to question Yangzhi without authorization.

Later, several great sword immortals privately sent flying swords to the Summer Palace, inquiring if the sword formation could still be used, but they were permitted to work together to interrupt Yangzhi’s actions.

The reply from the Hidden Official lineage’s flying sword was still that great sword immortals were not allowed to act without permission, warning that peak great demons, including Huang Luan, were lying in wait, and this more obvious ambush could be even deadlier than the previous concealment of great demons within the Five Mountains. The position where Yangzhi stood was extremely crucial; even a slight shift could cost the lives of one or two great sword immortals from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Once the battle escalated, with both sides’ top combatants entering the fray, regardless of how both sides suffered losses, it would quickly advance the progression of this war.

Nalan Shaowei, Yue Qing, and Yao Lianyun, among others, managed to hold back from drawing their swords, but everyone felt pent-up frustration.

Even Yue Qing cursed under his breath.

Yao Lianyun’s face was particularly grim.

Before this, the head of the Yao family had been spirited, slicing through every battle with vigor, a sight to behold.

The biggest issue was that the sword immortals were following the commands of the Hidden Official lineage.

However, a group of young sword cultivators, filled with indignation, instead took the initiative to strike first, launching dozens of flying swords to question the great demon Yangzhi.

If it weren’t for several great sword immortals quickly intervening, it’s likely that over a hundred life swords would have rushed at that great demon. If that happened, even more flying swords would have followed suit, and the entire sword formation would have likely seen a division.

Yangzhi’s response was filled with surprises; seeing that several great sword immortals had blocked the subsequent questioning, she not only did not destroy any of the approaching flying swords but casually maneuvered those uncontrolled swords belonging to cultivators on the city walls to approach the sword immortal facing a grim fate, as if deliberately allowing this dying sword immortal to meet those young sword cultivators. Finally, she returned all thirty-nine flying swords to the city walls, letting them return safely to the sword formation.

In the end, Yangzhi shattered the remaining soul of the sword immortal in her grasp, laughing, “What a Sword Qi Great Wall! What a sword immortal with heavenly killing power! Everyone sees death and refuses to save; yet a group of mere young sword cultivators struggles to offer their lives to save. I understand the former’s desire to live, and I respect the latter’s stupidity!”

Afterward, the hearts of the people within the Sword Qi Great Wall became even more intricate than when the previous Hidden Official Xiao Xian betrayed the Sword Qi Great Wall, injuring others.

The command and dispatch that had been increasingly smooth within the Hidden Official lineage started to show slight stagnation here and there.

Among those on the Sword Qi Great Wall, a heartfelt, furious sentiment arose.

“Why should the Hidden Official take risks and die? Why not save us?! We sword cultivators are willing to die; why won’t they?”

Afterward, more discussions evolved.

“Today, that sword immortal risked his life for the Great Dao, intending to slay enemies in the heart of the Barbarian World, and still received no help. In the future, if the Barbarian World’s ants swarm to attack, if there’s even a chance it’s a trap, which sword cultivator will the Hidden Official save?”

“Even that great demon respects those who willingly draw their swords to face death; yet it turns out our own people are so cold-blooded, calculating every detail. Such a Hidden Official, is it really beneficial to the Sword Qi Great Wall? Can it truly compare to what the previous Hidden Official did? At least the latter dared to plunge into the fray, slaying countless demon beasts in battle before betraying us!”

With these emerging sentiments, it was clear that more thoughts and ideas lay buried deep in the hearts of many.

Chen Pingan walked back out of the main hall just as Song Gaoyuan, Cao Gun, and Xuan Can were returning from the city walls with their swords. Next, it would be the turn of Luo Zhenyi, Xu Ning, and Chang Taiqing, three local sword cultivators, to head to the city walls to slay demons.

Song Gaoyuan and Cao Gun wore gloomy expressions.

Among them, Xuan Can, the youngest, was surprisingly the most open-minded of the sword cultivators, even showing a hint of a smile as he said, “Hidden Official, I advise Luo Zhenyi and the others not to go to the city walls for now. First, they will be isolated; often, they will be snatched away by other sword cultivators for the battlefield. Our efforts in slaying demons would be nearly fruitless. Furthermore, although they don’t speak ill of us, mentioning the Hidden Official, there are no good words and not a hint of caution.”

The first two batches of sword cultivators from the Hidden Official lineage who went to the city walls to slay demons mostly returned injured, while this time Xuan Can and the others returned unscathed.

Luo Zhenyi and the others stood by the door, looking to the young Hidden Official for guidance.

Whether to go or not depended on the Hidden Official’s word.

Chen Pingan turned and said, “We still have to go.”

Luo Zhenyi nodded, and along with the other two sword cultivators, they left on their swords.

Chen Pingan smiled, “Thank you for your hard work.”

Cao Gun looked dispirited, “We aren’t working hard at all.”

Chen Pingan comforted him, “Now that’s true hard work.”

Cao Gun forced a smile, wanting to say something but held back.

They all returned to the main hall and took their seats.

Lin Junbi sighed, “We can’t just openly discuss with everyone that the ferry between the Eight Continents of the Haoran world and our dealings have changed significantly. We have hope to prolong this battle, enough to exhaust more of the Barbarian World’s resources, even those peak great demons must feel the pinch. We’ve worked so long for this, finally seeing a glimpse of victory; how can we let Yangzhi’s little tricks ruin it?”

Xuan Can gloomily added, “It’s often said, ‘The one who kills the killers kills on behalf of the great craftsman.’”

Cao Gun nodded in agreement. “Indeed, ‘The one who kills on behalf of the great craftsman rarely escapes unscathed.’”

Lin Junbi chuckled, “You’re misusing the sage’s words; moreover, they’re hardly comforting.”

Chen Pingan laughed, “Not talking about the sage’s true meaning, just using it here brings a different flavor.”

The usually quiet Miao Sword Immortal even shared some insights, “What is true is true, but in the end, it’s not the same as reality. This makes it hardest to reason.”

Many heated arguments don’t arise from one extreme being unreasonable and the other being entirely logical, but from each side having its own reasoning, with varying degrees of right and wrong.

Lin Junbi asked, “Is there a way to resolve this situation?”

Chen Pingan nodded, “Of course.”

“How?”

“First, acknowledge that it’s unsolvable.”

Everyone fell silent, with only Lin Junbi seeming to grasp something.

When Pang Yuanji returned and took his seat, Chen Pingan spoke with his heart to the three of them: Miao Sword Immortal, Lin Junbi, and Pang Yuanji.

The Miao Sword Immortal rejected outright.

Pang Yuanji was frustrated and didn’t want to say another word.

Lin Junbi asked, “Hidden Official, clearly you uncovered that Ascended Realm great demon. Why would you want to share this monumental achievement with us three?”

Chen Pingan smiled, “To break the deadlock. If the credit belongs solely to me, who would believe it now? Even if they did, what difference would it make? By the way, when the young sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall reach their lowest point, gathering in groups to shout outside the Summer Palace, the highest-ranked Miao Sword Immortal will be responsible for climbing the city walls and presenting that great demon’s head, paying respects to the Barbarian World.”

Pang Yuanji said, “I should have agreed to drink before and gotten drunk outside instead.”

Guo Zhujiu was unaware of what her master was whispering about.

It must have been some discussion.

Guo Zhujiu finally looked down at the two treasured items she was to keep safe on the table, both gifts from the Fuyiao Continent’s mountains and waters.

One was an ancient inkstone, a square piece adorned with the patterns of a Kuilong, with an engraved seal: “Clouds Hang Low, Waters Stand Tall, Words Flow Deep.”

As for the other, a fan shimmering with treasure light, the inscription was also pretty elegant: “Golden Ripples, Jade Circles. The old fool dreams of the Moon Palace, carving away at the osmanthus tree. People say, on this night most complete, lights illuminate countless homes.”

Master had secretly told her that once she accumulated some military achievements, they would keep these two treasures for themselves.

Dong Budu suddenly raised her head and said, “Green Duan, that fan is one I’ve had my eyes on for a long time.”

Guo Zhujiu asked, “If it was once tucked away by Chen Sanqiu, would you still want it, Sister Dong?”

Dong Budu coldly laughed, “If Chen Sanqiu wants to see this fan, you’ll have to smash through the walls of the Summer Palace first to clear the way.”

Guo Zhujiu slapped her forehead, proudly declaring, “My Iron Head skill is extraordinary; even Master cannot compare!”

Chen Pingan laughed, “It’s not about competing in this; remember, this isn’t a secret skill of our sect, but something you’ve comprehended yourself.”

Guo Zhujiu nodded, “With my big sister’s mad sword technique combined with my unique skill, we can promote it greatly in the future!”

Chen Pingan waved his hand, continuing to gaze at the map on the ground.

Guo Zhujiu patted the little snowman’s head, which was getting smaller and smaller.

Chen Pingan suddenly asked, “Isn’t Lu Zhi about to return to the Inverted Mountain soon?”

Lin Junbi nodded, “Barring any accidents, she should return with Shao Yunyan today.”

Chen Pingan stood up, “Miao, accompany me to the Inverted Mountain.”

At Chunfan Studio.

Mi Yu was meticulous and focused on checking the accounts.

This wasn’t actually Mi Yu’s forte; to put it bluntly, if Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan wanted to misappropriate funds while going through the ledger, the only way Mi Yu could find a flaw would be if the young Hidden Official had reviewed it and then sent Mi Yu over to relay the message verbatim. Therefore, Nalan Caihuan and Yan Ming were both cooperating and keeping each other in check, with Mi Yu merely being a pawn placed by the young Hidden Official at Chunfan Studio, doing it for show. Nalan Caihuan viewed Mi Yu as a second-rate sword immortal who happened to drink the bamboo sea cave wine and had connections with the young Hidden Official, holding little goodwill toward him.

However, Mi Yu often encountered difficult issues and would consult Yan Ming for key insights.

Yan Ming had a very poor impression of Mi Yu, only stating things as they were, never showing a good face.

Anyone with even a bit of ambition at the Sword Qi Great Wall, regardless of their cultivation level, held a poor impression of the wine-loving Mi Sword Immortal.

Mi Yu surprisingly asked three times and appeared willing to ask thirty more in the future.

This made Nalan Caihuan feel increasingly strange about Mi Yu.

Nalan Caihuan didn’t bother to hide anything from Mi Yu and straightforwardly asked, “Mi Yu, have you lost your mind?”

Mi Yu replied, “Have I ever been normal?”

Nalan Caihuan didn’t bother with polite words, “Mi Yu, you’re really not suited for accounting. Don’t waste the head of the Yan family’s time with trivial matters. When it comes to handling affairs, don’t say that Shao Yunyan isn’t at the Inverted Mountain now; even if he were at Chunfan Studio, he is ultimately an outsider sword immortal. If no one from our side shows up beforehand, he’s just a sword immortal at Chunfan Studio, which isn’t appropriate. The unpleasant words you casually mentioned before actually carry some truth.”

Mi Yu asked curiously, “Which words?”

Yan Ming said, “Thunder begins with lightning; one must first establish authority before launching an expedition.”

Mi Yu burst out laughing, “So that’s it.”

This phrase was derived from a fan’s inscription at Yan’s shop, and the reason it was in Mi Yu’s mouth was incidental; the main point was the other side of the folding fan, which read, “The beauty hasn’t arrived but the fragrance has, before she rises, my heart is already stirred.” This captivated Mi Yu at first glance. The fan’s one side had serious wording while the other was articulate, making Mi Yu feel it was tailor-made for him. Unfortunately, he didn’t know which young lady had gotten there first. Fortunately, the Yan family’s shop also sold inscribed fan covers, and the prices were not low.

In the room, there was also an outsider who was observant and quiet.

The direct disciple of Shao Yunyan at Chunfan Studio, Wei Wenlong, was a genius in divination.

Compared to the three outsiders in the room, Wei Wenlong was incredibly reserved.

He sat alone, quietly working through the seemingly dull ledgers that bored the others, as if he was swimming in water.

In essence, Wei Wenlong was not good at dealing with people; he was destined to have only numbers and divine money as his lifelong friends.

Finances and accounting had always been viewed as lowly professions; officials from the Ministry of Revenue were even mocked as “murky officials.” This was true both on and off the mountain; those managing the ferries between the eight continents were often pitiful people, with no hope of achieving the Great Dao, unable to break their respective bottlenecks.

Additionally, Wei Wenlong was merely at the Golden Core level, facing two long-established Nascent Soul sword immortal family heads and a Mi Sword Immortal who sounded as though he had just reached the fifth realm.

He indeed didn’t dare to breathe too loudly.

The local Qi Cultivators born from the Inverted Mountain were not unfamiliar with the Sword Qi Great Wall but were not intimate either.

In fact, they were less so than the outsiders who intentionally traveled to the Inverted Mountain, as those often aimed for the Sword Qi Great Wall.

There were many people like Wei Wenlong, a native of the Inverted Mountain, who had never visited the Sword Qi Great Wall in their entire lives.

What Wei Wenlong feared most was that renowned sword immortal, Mi Yu.

The charming rogue was the most fickle.

Moreover, he was a sword immortal.

Mi Yu felt Nalan Caihuan was right and humbly accepted the advice, getting up to leave the room.

Before Mi Yu left, he wore a friendly expression and spoke sincerely to Wei Wenlong, “Wenlong, you are a talent that our Hidden Official values greatly. Don’t belittle yourself; do your work well, and the Great Dao will be within reach. From now on, we’ll be friends.”

Wei Wenlong hurriedly stood up, but he was too reserved, too timid, and didn’t manage to utter a word. Mi Yu found this lad increasingly likable and urged him to sit and work without being so polite.

Mi Yu walked to the empty main hall, glancing at the seats previously occupied by several female cultivator shipowners.

Finally, he sat in his chair, taking out a jade token he prepared to gift. This was a bit peculiar.

The jade token, engraved with the number ninety-nine, was a matter that the Hidden Official had specifically instructed him to give to the Fan family’s ferry at Guihua Island before leaving.

Not to mention the shipowner of the Aihai Continent, Jiang Gaotai, even the sword immortal Shao’s face had not been spared.

However, the little manager of the Ding family’s ferry was trembling as he privately approached the Hidden Official, offering a “fair” price that even Mi Yu found unexpected.

But the Ding family genuinely hoped that future transactions would trouble the Hidden Official, to avoid the Ding family’s ferry becoming a target of resentment.

The young Hidden Official agreed with a smile, saying Chunfan Studio would undoubtedly return the favor.

Later, when Mi Yu inquired about this matter, the Hidden Official merely said that every family has its burdens to bear, and that the Ding family had no choice.

Without the female shipowner, Mi Yu didn’t bother thinking too hard on it.

However, regarding the Fan family’s cross-continent ferry, Mi Yu knew quite a bit. There was no helping it; there was a remarkable lady named Lady Guihua on Guihua Island, not in terms of appearance.

Mi Yu was not superficial, well aware that a woman’s beauty comes in many forms.

Only those who focused solely on facial features and figures were missing the myriad facets of female allure, rendering them unworthy of being considered Mi Yu’s peers.

The Fan family of Old Dragon City was inconspicuous among the families engaged in cross-continent ferry trading.

In fact, aside from the Fu family having a slight reputation, the other major surnames’ ferries were hardly worth mentioning when docked at the Inverted Mountain.

Just like the Ding family shipowner who earlier held discussions in the Chunfan Studio main hall, he did not measure up to the “Nishang” shipowner, Liu Shen.

As long as it involved enchanting women, Mi Yu would inevitably feel touched, never letting a beauty go to waste.

Mi Yu soon remembered that it seemed a young lady named Jin Su lived on Guihua Island, and she was quite beautiful too.

Of course, Mi Yu had never seen her.

He wouldn’t go out of his way to see Jin Su, not in the past, and certainly not now.

During that time at Chunfan Studio, gathering so many ferries in one night involved significant intrigue.

Wu Qiao and Bai Xi, those old foxes, along with the Rain Dragon Sect, which had a private residence called the Water Crystal Palace at the Inverted Mountain, and the Mei Flower Garden, all contributed greatly.

But the Hidden Official had never mentioned this matter, nor did he intend to settle scores afterward.

After all, it was merely a small matter.

This time, only twelve shipowners received invitations to visit Chunfan Studio for discussions.

Many shipowners who had docked at the Inverted Mountain early chose to linger for a while, neither in a hurry to unload their cargo nor to leave, waiting for invitations from Chunfan Studio.

Except for the closest Southern Posha Continent, it seemed the earlier ferries had yet to return to their respective continents and were still on their way back.

Apart from the Fan family’s Guihua Island, there was also the Hou family’s ferry, the “Yanzhi.”

They must have received flying sword messages from the Fu or Ding families; these two cross-continent ferries arrived at the Inverted Mountain one after the other within just two days.

The various ferries from the Eight Continents, along with the Yan family, Nalan family, or the widely connected Sun Juyuan, all had varying degrees of personal relationships. The reasoning was simple: on the Sword Qi Great Wall, sword immortals or their descendants from influential families often had numerous strange requests. Not to mention the exorbitant prices for rare treasures, they also sought nearly a hundred types of mountain delicacies at inflated prices.

The Hou family ferry, “Yanzhi,” catered specifically to provide exquisite fragrances, weaving sixteen types of fragrant sachets for the fixed buyers on the Sword Qi Great Wall.

On this matter, the Hidden Official lineage had seen considerable disputes. Lin Junbi and Miao Sword Immortal rarely stood on the same front, proposing to cut off all such supply channels and cease receiving any useless items for the Sword Qi Great Wall.

However, in the end, they chose a compromise plan to reduce such business dealings, but did not completely sever the connections.

Guihua Island, still docked at the Zhuofang Pavilion, received the Chunfan Studio invitation. After the Hou family ferry manager arrived, they exchanged information.

Currently, the manager position of Guihua Island had fallen to the Fan family’s offering, Ma Zhi.

A Golden Core sword cultivator, his life sword was “Liang Yin.”

The small courtyard on Guihua Island was recorded in the name of an outsider and had not opened to the public for years.

Ma Zhi had previously guided an outsider youth in swordsmanship there.

In Lady Guihua’s elegant courtyard, her disciple Jin Su was responsible for brewing tea for guests.

Ma Zhi and the Hou family shipowner were discussing how to present gifts, as they heard previously that Lingzhi Studio had lost over a hundred pieces of fairy treasures overnight. The remaining items were either too lightweight for meaningful sentiment or were excessively expensive, intimidating buyers.

Shipowner Hou Peng was quite worried about this; although the Hou family conducted thriving business in the expansive area north of Old Dragon City and south of Guanhu Academy, the actual profits outside the books were quite limited. If the Hou family ferry “Yanzhi” had heard of this matter before leaving Old Dragon City, they would need to visit Chunfan Studio and prepare a hefty gift before entering, which would not be too troublesome. This amount of profit was still manageable. However, as Hou Peng and Guihua Island received their flying sword messages halfway through, he would have to cover the expenses himself, which was troublesome. If the gifts were insufficient in weight, the Chunfan Studio would snub them, and later, the Fan family’s ancestral hall would likely criticize him; if he spent too much, after passing through Chunfan Studio, his family would have more gossip to deal with.

People who genuinely do things often encounter mistakes, while those who enjoy comfort at home chatter endlessly throughout the year.

Ma Zhi was not much better off; the Fan family was in a troublesome period, and the old sword cultivator, precisely because of being close to the future family head Fan Er, was dragged into it as well.

Now, every one of his actions was closely monitored by the old men of the Fan family’s ancestral hall.

The eldest Miss Fan Junmiao had not shown herself for a long time; the Fan family claimed she had gone on a long journey alone.

Ma Zhi had some speculations but didn’t dare to discuss it with anyone.

The young Fan Er, having transformed from a boy into a young man, was gradually beginning to participate in family business affairs. Naturally, Ma Zhi belonged to the faction of Fan Er; otherwise, he couldn’t have become the manager of the ferry, even if Lady Guihua had put forward the recommendation.

Although Guihua Island was already under Fan Er’s ownership, the Fan family had substantial doubts about this inexperienced young master. After all, he had borrowed a large sum of money from the Gu Yu family to assist the down-and-out Longquan of the Great Li dynasty. The discussions held in the ancestral hall had been heated, with many old-timers believing that Fan Er was still too naive and impulsive. Even the future family head should not completely manage Guihua Island’s ferry business; a more seasoned elder from the Fan family should assist with management for a while before trusting Fan Er with it.

If it weren’t for the Sun family also chipping in, along with Fan Er using a significant amount of his own private funds already recorded in his name, this would not have been possible.

Lady Guihua merely drank tea, her demeanor calm, without a word.

Both sides roughly agreed on how to prepare gifts and conduct themselves once inside Chunfan Studio, generally learning from the previously discussed matters with the Fu and Ding families: say little, watch more, and speak less is no mistake.

Hou Peng set down his teacup, a strange expression crossing his face.

After Ma Zhi finished discussing the issues, he no longer drank the tea and instead helped himself to a pot of Guihua’s brew.

Hou Peng asked softly, “The new Hidden Official is Chen Pingan, right?”

Ma Zhi’s face stiffened, but he couldn’t help but burst into laughter, “Brother Hou, what are you thinking?!”

Jin Su was bewildered.

Lady Guihua chuckled softly, teasing, “A rare guest, a noble guest.”

After Chen Pingan sat down, he apologized, “Lady Guihua, don’t think too much; I just came here to ask for a pot of Guihua brew.”

Lady Guihua brought out a jug of Guihua brew, handing it to the young man, asking with a smile, “Since you say that, does it mean the Hidden Official has begun paying attention to the Mei Flower Garden?”

Chen Pingan remained silent.

Lady Guihua then asked, “You’re not worried about me and that rosy-faced lady being in cahoots?”

Chen Pingan shook his head, “Of course not.”

Lady Guihua no longer asked about the fate of the Mei Flower Garden.

Chen Pingan said he came here to drink but didn’t actually drink much of the Guihua brew; instead, he smiled and asked, “Miss Jin Su, do you still like Sun Jianshu and not Fan Er?”

Lady Guihua nodded.

Then Chen Pingan only sat for a while, and Lady Guihua merely chatted about Fan Er’s recent situation.

Both seemed to have little more to say aside from the subject of Fan Er.

After such a long separation, their words were few, unlike the instant connection they had during their first meeting, the sword-bearing youth and Lady Guihua.

Lady Guihua, of course, could also see that the young Hidden Official, despite his youth, was burdened with worries. It was evident that his current situation was not easy.

After Chen Pingan had a small jug of Guihua brew, he prepared to return to the Inverted Mountain’s Chunfan Studio, but he wouldn’t be appearing there.

This trip was, besides for leisure, more importantly to request that Guihua Island relay a letter to Cui Dongshan and the royal prince Song Jixin.

Lady Guihua accepted the two sealed letters.

After Chen Pingan thanked her and was about to take his leave, a familiar figure ran from the courtyard entrance.

It was the young lady from the Guihua small courtyard, Jin Su.

Chen Pingan stood up to greet her, smiling as he called out, “Miss Jin Su.”

Jin Su paused for a moment, halting her steps, clearly not expecting this fellow to sneakily come to Guihua Island. She smiled back, “Chen Pingan, why are you here?”

Then Jin Su quickly corrected herself, “Young Master Chen.”

Chen Pingan helplessly said, “Just call my name.”

Jin Su nodded, sitting beside Lady Guihua and softly asking, “Aren’t you practicing punches at the Sword Qi Great Wall? Why do you have time to run over here for wine? I heard that both gates of the Inverted Mountain are strictly guarded, like preventing thieves.”

Jin Su hesitated for a moment before gently asking, “Is it because you accidentally share the same name as that Hidden Official, making you feel some frustration and thus came here to drink away your sorrows?”

Chen Pingan stifled a laugh and nodded, “That’s right.”

Lady Guihua also smiled knowingly.

Jin Su lamented, “I had hoped that you were the legendary Hidden Official, the great sword immortal of the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Chen Pingan said, “If I were really that Hidden Official, I think Miss Jin Su would also feel frustrated enough to want to drink.”

Jin Su broke into a bright smile and turned to Lady Guihua, saying, “Master, Young Master Chen speaks much more refined now than before.”

Lady Guihua asked with a smile, “What brings you back?”

Jin Su softly replied, “I still want to stroll around the Deer Horn Cliff.”

Lady Guihua looked at Chen Pingan.

The young man gave a significant glance.

Lady Guihua nodded but said, “Just right, you and Young Master Chen can go together towards the Zhuofang Pavilion.”

Jin Su hurriedly said, “No, no, I know the Inverted Mountain better than Young Master Chen.”

She liked Sun Jianshu and disliked Fan Er, while Chen Pingan was good friends with Fan Er and business partners with Sun Jianshu.

Thus, she felt it best not to get involved with Chen Pingan at all.

Lady Guihua didn’t press further, letting Jin Su leave alone, and her smile widened.

After a brief wait, Chen Pingan then stood up to bid farewell to Lady Guihua.

As Lady Guihua escorted him to the door, she suddenly said, “Be cautious of the most adept at hiding their clumsiness, Zhengyang Mountain.”

Chen Pingan casually glanced in the direction of Baoping Continent, nodding, “I will.”

Internally, he silently muttered that in the future, Zhengyang Mountain should kneel and beg him to be less cautious.

Lady Guihua asked, “Is it finally that sword cultivator?”

Chen Pingan replied with his heart, “Two life swords; once I reveal my identity as a sword cultivator, I’ll declare one as ‘Chopping Firewood’ and the other as ‘Accounts.’”

Lady Guihua remained silent for a moment before insincerely saying, “Nice names.”

As for what Chen Pingan’s true names for the two flying swords were, Lady Guihua had completely lost her curiosity.

Chen Pingan scratched his head, saying, “As for the real names of the flying swords, one is ‘Caged Sparrow.’ I originally planned to name it ‘Mid-Autumn,’ but it seems to conflict with ‘Flying Sword Fifteen.’ The other one, I’m still torn between ‘Moon in the Sky’ or ‘Moon in the Well.’”

When it comes to naming things, being too skilled is not necessarily a good thing.

Lady Guihua laughed, “At last, they have names befitting flying swords.”

Chen Pingan quietly left Guihua Island, meeting Miao Sword Immortal at the Zhuofang Pavilion.

The two then headed towards the Mei Flower Garden.

They sought to meet that rosy-faced lady, who was at home yet longing for a distant land. 

In addition to the Miao Sword Immortal, there was also Lu Zhi, who had just returned from her journey to the Fuyiao Continent’s mountains and waters.

When it came to reasoning with ladies, it must be the ladies themselves who spoke.

 ### Chapter 752: Whispers Among the Mountains

The Plum Blossom Garden was the most intricate of the four private residences on Hanging Mountain, renowned for its winding corridors. However, it was best known for the plum trees, which grew naturally without the twisted forms of sickly or stunted trees. Their arrangement was haphazard yet pleasing, a testament to nature's artistry. Despite this, the garden was celebrated far and wide due to its substantial investment in importing numerous celestial plum trees from the Eight Continents, which were then transplanted into the garden.

The best spot for viewing in the Plum Blossom Garden was the pavilion with the plaque inscribed with "Not Contending for Spring."

The charming Madam Rouyan knelt on a bamboo mat made from the green bamboo of Qing Shen Mountain, her hands folded neatly on her knees, exuding grace and a warm smile. 

She turned her gaze towards the three sword cultivators slowly ascending the steps of the pavilion and said with a smile, "Since the matter has come to light, I am willing to accept my punishment. I just hope that the Great Sword Immortal Lu Zhi will be swift with her sword."

Chen Ping'an sat on the ground opposite Madam Rouyan and asked, "Will you not attempt to remedy this? The cultivation of plant spirits at the Fifth Realm is no easy task."

In the entire history of Baoping Continent, there had yet to be a single plant spirit at the Fifth Realm.

Madam Rouyan shook her head, saying, "If I could find my way past the border and kill it, it would only mean that I am destined not to survive. There's no need for pretenses."

Chen Ping'an pressed on, "Then the true form of that ascended great demon is buried beneath the Plum Blossom Garden? Otherwise, how would you know the border is dead?"

Madam Rouyan smiled but did not respond. Instead, she extended a hand towards the tall, slender woman, "It has been said that among the women of the Sword Qi Great Wall, the one resembling Sword Immortal Lu Zhi is the most beautiful, capable of toppling nations. The harmony between person and sword is truly fitting; seeing her today, it is indeed true."

Lu Zhi frowned slightly.

Sword Immortal Chou Miao sighed, knowing well who had spoken such words.

Chen Ping'an then queried, "So I will ask you one thing: you were born in the realm of Hao Ran, so why do you long for the wild and untamed world?"

Madam Rouyan chuckled, "The rules set by the Sage of Rituals are good, but unfortunately, the later generations of cultivators have not upheld them well. Once they ascend the mountain and attain the Dao, there are countless immortals and divine figures, yet how many regard us fortunate plant spirits as people? I have suffered greatly and do not wish to speak of it. After barely escaping the sea of suffering, I look around, and throughout the centuries, the human world has shown little difference. Therefore, I have harbored resentment for a long time."

She turned her gaze towards a large door nearby the Plum Blossom Garden before withdrawing it and smiling, "It's not that I truly like the wild world, where uncivilized beasts hold power; such a distant land, compared to Hao Ran, can it really be any better? I merely wish to see the realm of Hao Ran with my own eyes. On the mountains and in the valleys, all are dead, and among the cultivators, those of the Dao will perish first. Only the plants remain, thriving in their cycles of life and death, flourishing through the years. Is that reason enough for you, Sir Hidden Official?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "If you say it is enough, then it is."

Chou Miao felt that this visit to the Plum Blossom Garden had unexpectedly gone quite smoothly.

Suddenly, Lu Zhi spoke up, "I will exchange the military achievements I have accumulated to spare her life. From now on, I will take her under my wing. Sir Hidden Official, what do you think?"

Chou Miao was taken aback.

Madam Rouyan was even more astonished. Just moments ago, she had truly resigned herself to death.

After countless calculations, she had deemed her fate either to die or to live a fate worse than death. If that were the case, her luck was not the worst; at least among the sword immortals, there was a woman, fortunate enough not to be surrounded by those filthy men—what could be simpler?

Madam Rouyan never expected Lu Zhi would say such words.

Lu Zhi addressed Madam Rouyan, "From now on, you will follow me in your cultivation; you need not be a servant or a maid."

Lu Zhi then turned to Chen Ping'an, seeking his agreement.

After a moment of thought, Chen Ping'an nodded, "That works."

Madam Rouyan collapsed to the ground, on the verge of tears.

All around the Plum Blossom Garden, the plum trees bloomed abundantly, reflecting the connection between Madam Rouyan and this small world, bringing forth a spectacle of nature.

Lu Zhi frowned, "Rouyan, I have only one request of you: in the future, when faced with life and death, if there are men before you, do not behave in such a manner. Of course, it won't be easy for others to want you dead."

Madam Rouyan bowed deeply to Lu Zhi, saying, "Thank you, Daoist friend Lu Zhi!"

She stood up gracefully and approached Lu Zhi's side.

Even Chou Miao had to admit that Madam Rouyan was an innate beauty.

Meanwhile, the young Hidden Official had squatted down to roll up the valuable bamboo mat from Qing Shen Mountain.

It was undeniably more genuine than his own bamboo sea cave wine.

Chou Miao pretended not to notice anything.

Madam Rouyan hesitated for a moment, looking at the young man who was moving the bamboo mat, and couldn't help but inquire with her heart, "What is this?"

Lu Zhi smiled, "Our Hidden Official is too shy to scavenge for land over at Spring Fan Pavilion, so this unclaimed Plum Blossom Garden is going to face a disaster."

Chou Miao became even more puzzled.

From Lu Zhi's tone, it seemed that her impression of this Hidden Official was not entirely negative?

Chen Ping'an finished rolling up the mat, tucking it under his arm, and stood up. "Lu Zhi, let me say this first: the reason the Plum Blossom Garden can take root on Hanging Mountain is not solely due to Madam Rouyan's cultivation but also because of cunning and strategy—something you are not particularly good at."

Lu Zhi shot a glance at Madam Rouyan, "It doesn't matter. As long as one is willing to risk their life, whether they are cultivators or plant spirits, it's all a matter of a single sword strike."

Continuing, Lu Zhi added, "Chen Ping'an, you are skilled in all sorts of convoluted calculations, so help me keep an eye on her in the future."

Lu Zhi then said to Madam Rouyan, "To be frank, I do not yet trust you. However, I can guarantee that after a thousand years, you will regain your freedom. If my path were to falter and I die within that thousand years, the matter of you will be left to Chen Ping'an. If you think a thousand years is too long, we can negotiate, but I won't agree to it."

Madam Rouyan smiled enchantingly, bowed deeply to Lu Zhi, her elegance captivating.

At Lu Zhi's level as a sword cultivator, her sword heart was exceptionally clear, and given Lu Zhi's many rumors and stories, Madam Rouyan was indeed willing to trust her.

Chou Miao gave a thumbs-up to the Hidden Official.

Indeed, women discussing matters among themselves was more appropriate.

Chen Ping'an put the bamboo mat away and asked Lu Zhi and Chou Miao to leave for a moment, saying he wanted to ask Madam Rouyan some matters.

The two sword immortals left the pavilion.

Madam Rouyan exclaimed softly, looking around, "Sir Hidden Official, you are truly deep and unassuming. After not seeing you for years, you’ve become a sword cultivator? The innate magical powers of this flying sword are so rare."

Chen Ping'an was not the least bit surprised and asked, "When Jiang Heng of Yuguizong visited Hanging Mountain and stayed at the Plum Blossom Garden, what did this Jiang family heir seek?"

Madam Rouyan countered, "Why not directly inquire about the matters of Guihua Island in Old Dragon City? Is it that you cannot bear to ask, yet feel compelled, or are you unwilling to ask because you fear the answer?"

Chen Ping'an frowned, "This matter does not require further inquiry."

Madam Rouyan laughed, "May I ask, Sir Hidden Official, if you were to go to Guihua Island now, would you call her Aunt Gui or Madam Gui?"

Chen Ping'an answered vaguely, "In the future, you should consider Lu Zhi more when you are by her side. The sword immortal's heart is too pure; however, without this sword heart, Lu Zhi would not be the Lu Zhi of today. But in the future, when she reaches the realm of Hao Ran, she may not find everything to her liking."

Madam Rouyan's eyes lit up. "I won’t have to stay at the Sword Qi Great Wall forever?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "In the future, you will accompany Lu Zhi to South Posa Continent."

Madam Rouyan smiled, "Since I can not only live but also have no worries, I will answer all your questions fully and truthfully. First, Jiang Heng is truly ambitious yet incompetent, vastly inferior to the border. Initially, Jiang Heng set his sights on the Guihua Island of the Fan family, but Madam Gui did not agree. He then foolishly tried to persuade me, in the Plum Blossom Garden, to assist Yuguizong in opening a new trade route, a transit point for Qi practitioners engaged in pearl harvesting on Luhua Island."

Chen Ping'an inquired, "Why not Rain Dragon Sect?"

Madam Rouyan shot him a sidelong glance, "Sir Hidden Official, are you truly unaware or just pretending to be ignorant?"

Chen Ping'an said, "Please tell me."

Madam Rouyan chuckled, "The Rain Dragon Sect has a female ancestor who, in her early years, traveled to Tongye Continent and was so smitten by Jiang Shangzhen that she nearly shattered her heart; she directly returned, a fine embryonic immortal, only barely entering the Jade Pure Realm after hundreds of years. As Jiang Heng's son, does he dare to go to Rain Dragon Sect seeking death? But times have changed; now, if Jiang Heng were to visit Rain Dragon Sect again, it would indeed be seeking death, but it would be difficult to achieve."

Chen Ping'an sat on a bench, rubbing his forehead.

Once Jiang Shangzhen was involved, everything turned into those bewildering surprises.

How many people would take the initiative to donate money to the mountain’s expenses?

But the biggest surprise was that Jiang Shangzhen had now actually become the leader of Yuguizong!

Xun Yuan was truly formidable.

In Chen Ping'an's mind, Jiang Shangzhen's current success owed much to Xun Yuan's influence.

Setting aside personal grievances, Chen Ping'an believed that the position of sect leader was one that Xun Yuan rightly deserved.

Xun Yuan's schemes against Chen Ping'an back then still left him feeling uneasy.

Madam Rouyan performed a hand sign, and a figure that resembled an old man appeared in the pavilion, which Chen Ping'an stowed away.

The ensuing questions and answers in the pavilion were succinct and to the point.

In the end, the group left the Plum Blossom Garden.

According to Madam Rouyan's prior revelations, the Plum Blossom Garden would indeed be able to relocate, but where it could escape to now was uncertain, especially since Madam Rouyan was now following Lu Zhi.

Lu Zhi took her directly to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Lu Zhi had a private residence south of the city, where Madam Rouyan would temporarily reside.

Chen Ping'an, along with Chou Miao, headed to Spring Fan Pavilion, where Madam Rouyan promised to catalog all the treasures of the Plum Blossom Garden. The volume should be quite thick and would later be sent to the Summer Resort Palace.

The nominal owner of the Plum Blossom Garden was merely a puppet that Madam Rouyan had raised.

The intricate and convoluted stories within, if Madam Rouyan were willing to share, and if the young Hidden Official had the leisure to document them, could likely fill a fantastical novel of twists and turns.

Upon arriving at Spring Fan Pavilion, Mi Yu and the others were in the main hall discussing business, and Shao Yunyan had yet to return from Hanging Mountain, arriving later than Lu Zhi.

It was not that Shao the Sword Immortal did not wish to return with Lu Zhi; it was simply that his flying sword could not catch up with hers.

To save time, he chose not to take a ferry, instead opting to fly his sword from Fuyou Continent all the way to Hanging Mountain, which was no small feat.

Tonight, twelve ferry managers were arriving at Spring Fan Pavilion, and not everyone could take a jade token home; however, as long as the relationships were not too close, these boatmen, seasoned by the dangers of the Jianghu, would not easily disclose to others who had received a token. Those who failed to get one would likely wish for others to believe they had secured one.

Chen Ping'an did not head to the main hall but found Wei Wenlong in the account room.

Chou Miao had no intention of dealing with a pile of account books; during her time at the Summer Resort Palace, she had also flipped through many books and accounts. As Cao Jun said, once she left the Summer Resort Palace, she never wanted to see another page of a book again in her life.

However, Chen Ping'an insisted on having Chou Miao sit down with him.

When Wei Wenlong saw the young Hidden Official and Sword Immortal Chou Miao, he became even more flustered.

Wei Wenlong had brought some miscellaneous books to this side. Chen Ping'an picked one up, opened it, and was pleasantly surprised; a true expert could discern quality at a glance. If this Wei Wenlong were merely a façade, Chen Ping'an felt he could consume that book in his hands.

For this "miscellaneous book," was actually a secret document from the Ministry of Revenue of the old Lu Dynasty in Baoping Continent, likely a result of Old Dragon City's intercontinental ferry service.

Wei Wenlong, feeling somewhat anxious, forced himself to speak softly, "Sir Hidden Official, as long as I have free time, there’s no need to settle accounts. I just read these Ministry of Revenue records on the overthrown dynasties of various continents. They were not expensive, bought by the sack, and compared to those rare items, they cost but a few snowflake coins. Moreover, thanks to my master’s connections, the six ferries in Old Dragon City have been quite generous, selling them at half price."

Chen Ping'an patted Wei Wenlong's shoulder, a bright smile on his face, "You've encountered a great person!"

Wei Wenlong stumbled back, more shocked than anything.

His smile was strained; it was no wonder that the Great Sword Immortal, the Hidden Official, had such terrifying strength.

Chen Ping'an moved a chair closer to Wei Wenlong and began asking about the annual tax situation of the Dali Dynasty.

Wei Wenlong answered fluently, also mentioning some minor tricks played by earlier Ministry officials. However, he indicated that the financial records of the Dali Dynasty had become increasingly obscured over the past century. Moreover, for such a large dynasty, the numbers on the accounts were all fabricated; the key lay in the secret treasury’s records. Otherwise, there was no need to discuss the imitation white jade capital of the Great Dali; the mountain and river ferries built by the Mo family alone would require a significant amount of divine money. Wei Wenlong speculated that aside from the Mo family, merchants must be behind the scenes propping up the Dali’s financial operations; otherwise, the funds should have collapsed long ago, rotting into nothingness.

Wei Wenlong was clearly determined to truly master the intricacies of fiscal matters, so he needed to delve deeply into a series of relevant rules.

Chen Ping'an mostly posed small, incisive questions that allowed Wei Wenlong to speak freely.

Once the topic turned to finances, Wei Wenlong transformed into a different person.

He articulated clearly and was adept with the rules, skilled in calculations.

Chen Ping'an listened intently.

This knowledge was truly valuable.

It was the first time Chou Miao had seen the young Hidden Official so animated.

Chen Ping'an suddenly said, "Complete the task, no interest in currency."

Wei Wenlong paused for a moment before softly asking, "What is the principle of governing a country?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "All farming should be beneficial, and all goods should flow freely; the marketplace should be abundant."

Wei Wenlong inquired, "What is the aim?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "To ensure wealth and currency flow like water!"

Wei Wenlong broke into a grin, unable to contain his excitement, his hands pressed down on the desk, jubilant, "Friend, you are truly a friend!"

Then, Wei Wenlong felt incredibly awkward, quickly pulling back his hands, trying to maintain a respectful demeanor as he softly said, "Sir Hidden Official, I have greatly offended you."

Chen Ping'an laughed, "We are fellow travelers; no need to mind that. From now on, call me Chen Daoist! You can also call me a good man brother."

Chou Miao couldn't help but ask, "Are you discussing merchant knowledge?"

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "There is a large connection, but they must not be conflated."

Wei Wenlong shot a glance at the sword immortal Chou Miao, who was sitting there like a wooden statue, nearly rolling his eyes. It was obvious he was a novice, utterly clueless about the subject, yet he was still a sword immortal.

No wonder he couldn't become the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Ping'an glanced out the window at the evening sky, leaving a jar of osmanthus wine on the table. He stood up, smiling, "You are always welcome to visit our Summer Resort Palace in the future. If you wish to stay longer, even better! I can directly clear out a residence for you. But it won't be until the trade route of the Eight Continents is properly established; otherwise, it would delay serious matters. No need to rush, no need to rush. Once I return to the Summer Resort Palace, I will help you clear out a unique residence."

Wei Wenlong hurriedly stood up, flustered, "Sir Hidden Official, this is too much, too much."

Chen Ping'an waved his hand, "It’s settled."

After leaving the room, at the end of winter, Chen Ping'an habitually rubbed his hands together for warmth.

Sword Immortal Chou Miao smiled, "In a good mood?"

Chen Ping'an grinned, "Great mood."

If given the chance, he would certainly want to recruit Wei Wenlong to Ruining Mountain in the future.

He could easily let Wei Wenlong practice on that Lotus Root Blessed Land.

Chou Miao looked at the young Hidden Official, who was grinning like a fool, and asked, "Is this Wei Wenlong truly that impressive?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "I wouldn’t trade a Spring Fan Pavilion for him, not even a bit."

Chou Miao inquired, "What if we added a Plum Blossom Garden?"

Chen Ping'an complained, "Sword Immortal Chou Miao, this kind of banter is no fun at all."

Chou Miao suddenly spoke in thought, "The Hidden Official’s schemes have yielded results; they can delay matters for another six months. If the trade routes of the Eight Continents go smoothly without major setbacks, we might gain another year. So, we are still short a year and a half."

Chou Miao was certainly regarded as the best candidate for the next Hidden Official, and it wasn’t without reason.

Chen Ping'an cursed under his breath.

Chou Miao chuckled, "Who are you cursing?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Definitely not the Great Sword Immortal."

Chou Miao smiled, "I advise you not to mistake me for Sword Immortal Mi Yu."

Chen Ping'an said, "This will not happen again; everything can be forgiven up to three times."

Chou Miao remarked, "That last look Wei Wenlong gave me seemed a bit off."

Chen Ping'an said, "Impossible; when Wei Wenlong looks at you, his eyes are full of admiration, almost mistaking you for a stunning woman."

Chou Miao laughed, "Sir Hidden Official, do you wish to return to the Summer Resort Palace with a bruised face, or do you want Wei Wenlong to be half-dead from my sword?"

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "Only up to three times."

Before becoming the new Hidden Official.

At the thatched cottage, Chen Ping'an had a conversation with the Great Sword Immortal.

"Do you think this Hidden Official can merely delay matters for the Sword Qi Great Wall by three years?"

"Just three?"

"Or should I let you delay for thirty years? If you think you can pull that off, promise me now, and I will help you propose to Ning Fu and the Yao family right away."

"Deal, no problem."

"Get lost."

After saying goodbye to Sister Bei at the Mountain Cliff Academy, Pei Qian and Cui Dongshan left the Great Sui Capital together.

They trekked through mountains and rivers, approaching the border of the former vassal Huang Ting Kingdom, which Pei Qian described as "easy and leisurely, accompanied by the Great Dao."

Along the way, holding a mountain staff and carrying a small bamboo box, Pei Qian diligently copied texts every day without fail, practicing that crazy demonic sword technique against Cui Dongshan, and had yet to lose a match.

Otherwise, she would be staring blankly at a cluster of golden threads—the essence of sword intent gifted to her by the swinging sword immortal from the Sword Qi Great Wall, Zhou Cheng.

Pei Qian asked the big white goose multiple times whether it was truly inedible. In the romantic novels that Sister Bei and Li Huai enjoyed, they often described treasures gifted by elders that could enhance one's inner strength when consumed.

Cui Dongshan insisted it was definitely not edible; if she did, she would be in for a disaster, with intestines spilling everywhere, not even able to hold it with both hands. Wouldn't that be disgusting if she tried to put it in her small book box?

Today, the two were by the river; Cui Dongshan was fishing while Pei Qian squatted nearby, using the small bamboo box as a makeshift writing desk.

Cui Dongshan had crafted the small bamboo writing box himself, which Pei Qian reluctantly accepted. Though she found its color unappealing, she didn’t directly say it, only asking if he knew what "vibrantly green" meant.

Cui Dongshan pretended not to hear her countless hints.

As he fished, Cui Dongshan rambled on about things that Pei Qian only half-listened to. 

He spoke of practicing writing, the method of imitating the ancients, like a ghost enjoying sacrifices, absorbing its essence but not consuming its substance. To honor the ancient, one must meet the divine encounter, passing a threshold.

"The novice must focus on the structure, ensuring clarity in strokes and markings; avoid lofty claims of profundity. Remember, it is not about quantity but continuity."

And then there were instructions on writing small script, advocating clarity and richness.

As Pei Qian copied her texts, she focused intently and ignored the big white goose’s chatter.

"Your writing, can it compare to Master’s? Look at how many convoluted sayings he has. You’re just showing off, trying to bully me because I’m copying less, aren’t you?"

Cui Dongshan turned his head and glanced at the serious Pei Qian, chuckling.

"Is my writing good? How it measures up can be gauged by the price of a few palm-sized pieces of calligraphy, and how much grain they can fetch."

Unfortunately, he couldn’t say this out loud; otherwise, Pei Qian might immediately rush up the mountain, chop out seven or eight large bamboo boxes, and insist he fill them up or not be allowed to leave.

Furthermore, not every stroke written could be deemed worthy of being a piece of calligraphy.

Once she finished copying, Pei Qian leaned against the small bamboo box, patiently waiting for a fish to bite; she had truly inherited her master's teachings on cooking fish.

Suddenly, Cui Dongshan asked if Pei Qian wanted to wander the Jianghu alone, to slowly return home to Ruining Mountain.

Pei Qian certainly dared not. Was the big white goose's head not quite right from being hit with a mountain staff? That question was such a wet blanket.

Pei Qian quickly said, "No, no, I must have Master’s consent to descend the mountain alone as his first disciple, plus I would need that little donkey for companionship to travel the rivers and mountains."

Cui Dongshan then mentioned that further ahead, the Yu River of Huang Ting Kingdom was where Chen Lingjun had made his fortune. There was also the Cao family’s Zhilian Pavilion, which was practically the hometown of the warm tree girl. Wouldn’t she want to go take a look?

Pei Qian adjusted the strap of her bamboo box, standing up and beginning to stroll beside Cui Dongshan, one hand holding the bamboo box and the other gripping her mountain staff. "You’re talking too much; wandering is trivial, but returning home is paramount. If I'm not there keeping an eye, wouldn’t the old chef’s great cooking skills go to waste? Besides, if I’m not watching the New Year shop, what if Sister Shi Rou secretly buys that rouge and powder, misusing funds?"

Cui Dongshan laughed, "Sister Shi Rou buys that rouge and powder? Why? To put it on her face? First scare the living, then frighten the ghosts?"

Pei Qian frowned, "Big White Goose, you mustn't speak ill of Sister Shi Rou. If she has to sneakily buy rouge and powder, she needs to keep it hidden well so I won't see, fearing I might laugh at her..."

Cui Dongshan chuckled, "So did you laugh at her?"

Pei Qian maintained a straight face, stifling laughter.

Cui Dongshan said, "Since the master is not around..."

Pei Qian burst out laughing. "When I was younger, I was even smaller and more clueless! I almost laughed myself to death back then, my stomach hurt so much I nearly put holes in the counter."

She quickly added, "But I only laughed; I didn’t say a single word of nonsense! I swear on my life!"

Cui Dongshan smiled, "Just too busy laughing to speak, huh?"

Pei Qian playfully slapped Cui Dongshan's head, her brows brightening, "Still, my little senior brother understands me! Look at you being so clever, let’s catch a big fish and cook it up! We have to eat well and drink well before we continue our journey!"

Then Pei Qian grew a little sad, "Sister Shi Rou is quite pitiful; you shouldn’t bully her anymore. It’s about reasoning, after all. Learn from Master, and speak well to her. Sister Shi Rou isn't dumb, she can understand. However, I’m just saying this casually…"

Pei Qian softly added, "Both my little senior brother and Master are people who think a lot before doing things. I don’t want to overthink things; I can’t even copy fast enough."

Cui Dongshan gazed at the water’s surface, rubbing his brow, "When Master was younger than you, he dared to leave the Great Sui alone to return home."

Pei Qian questioned, "Is it so surprising that a disciple can't match his master?"

Cui Dongshan replied, "Disciples need not be inferior to their masters; that is what the ancient sages taught in black and white."

Pei Qian pouted, "I only listen to Master."

Cui Dongshan sighed, "I truly have urgent matters and must head to the Great Dali Capital immediately. Even the ferry seems too slow. If I delay, the next time I meet my senior sister, it might be quite difficult—who knows when that will be."

Pei Qian thought for a moment and nodded, "Fine, if you had begged me earlier, it would have been done. I can walk back to Ruining Mountain alone—it's just a small matter!"

She pulled out a yellow paper talisman from her sleeve, not immediately sticking it to her forehead, but carefully tucking it back into her sleeve.

She had traveled through countless mountains and rivers with her master, so this talisman had also accompanied her for quite some time.

With it, she feared nothing.

Cui Dongshan smiled and asked, "So I’m really leaving now?"

Pei Qian impatiently replied, "Stop talking so much! You think my crazy demonic sword technique is just for show?"

Cui Dongshan sighed, "Fine, fine, then I’ll stay with you a bit longer. Otherwise, Master will blame me later."

Standing next to Cui Dongshan, Pei Qian said, "Go on, go on, don’t mind me! I’m not afraid of all the sword qi immortals at the Sword Qi Great Wall, why would I fear a Huang Ting Kingdom?"

Cui Dongshan put away his fishing rod.

"I’ll walk you a little way; see that stone cliff over there? I’ll take you to that point."

As they walked along the riverbank, Pei Qian softly said, "Big White Goose, can I speak my mind?"

"Sure."

"Actually, Master worries that I won’t know better in the future, and I get that. But Master also worries that I’ll end up like him, which I just can't comprehend. What’s wrong with being like Master?"

"Why not just tell Master directly?"

"Master already worries; if I say this, he’ll probably worry even more. The more he worries, the more worried I become. The master I love most is this first disciple of his, and then I worry more and more..."

Cui Dongshan looked towards the distant green mountains and smiled, "With a calm heart, let the white clouds deal with trivial matters; wait for the rain to come when you leave the mountain."

Pei Qian frowned, "Are you making fun of me?"

"I’m praising you."

"By the heavens?"

"By the heavens!"

In the end, Pei Qian stopped and said solemnly, "Little Senior Brother, take care on your journey!"

Cui Dongshan nodded with a smile, "If I hadn’t met Master, I wouldn’t have such a wonderful senior sister like you."

With that, Cui Dongshan leaped into the air, like a wisp of white cloud returning home.

However, he didn’t leave just yet. Using an illusion technique, he surveyed the riverside.

He saw Pei Qian standing in place for a long while before finally mustering the courage to move, shaking her hands as she tried to take large strides, albeit slowly. At this rate, it would take her a century to reach Qidun Mountain.

Cui Dongshan rubbed his brow, feeling exasperated.

He watched for a long time until Pei Qian seemed to have found her resolve. She took a deep breath, stomped her foot down heavily, and dashed forward in an instant, disappearing like a flash of lightning.

Cui Dongshan felt even more worried.

With Pei Qian's minute courage, if she encountered any mountain spirits or ghosts, wouldn’t they just scare each other to death?

Cui Dongshan glanced around, riding the wind in a flash, yet silently, he headed towards a larger river. Stomping his foot, he shook the river god awake, grabbing its head and twisting its wrist so that its face turned towards the petite figure carrying a bamboo box. "Did you see that? My senior sister, you will be escorted to Hongzhu Town without any appearance. You cannot reveal yourself or leave any traces; after that, you can head home, and it will count as a contribution for you. Later, you can obtain a no-incident talisman from Dali; the Ministry of Rites will see to it, just wait at home. But if anything goes wrong, I’ll shatter your golden body."

As he spoke, Cui Dongshan exerted more force with his fingers, causing the water god’s golden body to explode like firecrackers, bursting with numerous cracks. After he withdrew his hand, "I feel like you’re not reliable at all; I’m worried you won’t take this seriously, so I shattered half of your golden body. After the task is completed, you can seek out the water god Yang Hua of the Iron Talisman River to help repair your golden body and claim that no-incident talisman."

The water god nearly collapsed on the spot, aghast at the audacity of this young man who was both powerful and brazen.

From start to finish, the little god had not uttered a word or completed a single task.

Cui Dongshan loosened his grip, gently patting the water god's head, and the numerous cracks in its golden body instantly closed, returning to normal.

Cui Dongshan shook his sleeves, watching the bewildered water god, and asked, "What are you dawdling for? Did the experience of having your golden body shattered feel so good that you want it again?"

The water god gulped, ready to ride the wind to pursue the so-called "senior sister."

But he was met with a slap from the white-clad youth, sending him splashing into the river, causing waves to erupt. "Is that how you're going? I told you not to leave a trace!"

Cui Dongshan smacked his forehead, "I should have asked the mountain god instead—my bad. I’m sorry, just go back where you came from."

Unexpectedly, the water god was not too foolish. He held back the pain from his golden body’s damage and knelt in the water, bowing, "Little god pays respects to the immortal master."

Cui Dongshan smiled, "No wonder you were once a little river lord, daring to wield a spear and declare, 'In Liu Gong's realm, no one dares to offend.' Get up and speak; I see you’re quite clever. I believe that even if you are a water god, you won’t fall too far behind once you enter the mountains. But to be safe, I’ll give you a Water God Mountain Crossing Talisman."

Cui Dongshan brought two fingers together, conjuring a golden talisman out of thin air, which he gently tossed down for the water god to catch.

When the water god looked up again, the white-clad youth’s figure had vanished.

With the Water God Mountain Crossing Talisman in hand, the water god found that by slightly channeling his spiritual energy, it merged seamlessly with his golden body.

After cautiously reaching the shore, he found himself moving even more freely than in the waters he ruled.

The water god felt as if he were dreaming.

He immediately concealed his aura and began to chase after that young girl.

Just as the water god relaxed, a ripple surged through his heart lake, akin to a raging storm. He had to stop in his tracks to resist it, and then he heard the white-clad youth’s voice again, “Remember, don’t approach my senior sister within a hundred yards. Otherwise, even with the talisman, you will still be detected; the consequences are yours to weigh. At that point, whether this talisman serves as a lifeline or a death knell, who can say?"

The water god immediately bowed and clasped his fists in acknowledgment.

After that, he followed the small girl from a distance.

The water god couldn’t help but feel amused. This little girl, despite her young age, could really run fast.

If she got hungry, she would run while pulling out dry rations from her bamboo box, hastily eating while continuing to run.

At first, the water god thought she was hiding from something.

But no matter how the water god searched, he found no signs.

Yet the water god grew increasingly puzzled; this little girl didn’t seem to be a practitioner of the Dao—how did she become such a formidable martial artist?

Throughout her journey, the little girl would bypass caves that offered shelter from the wind and rain, neglected and dilapidated temples, and even places rich in spiritual energy.

When she finally became tired and wanted to rest, she consciously chose to do so during the day, drawing a large circle with her staff and muttering to herself, then briefly resting, only to rise quickly and resume her journey.

Eventually, when the little girl leaped onto a high branch and caught sight of a city’s outline, her face scrunched up as if she were about to cry.

The water god was just feeling pity for the little girl when she landed heavily on the ground, swaggering along as if nothing were wrong, swinging her staff and humming about how delicious stinky tofu was.

The water god, of course, had no idea.

From a high branch, the white-clad youth quietly stood watching, his expression gentle, gazing at Pei Qian from a distance.

Only Cui Dongshan understood why things were this way.

When Master wasn’t around her, or she wasn’t at Master’s side, every place she passed alone mirrored the Lotus Root Blessed Land of her childhood.

Everyone she met along the way would resemble those familiar faces from the streets and alleys of the Lotus Root Blessed Land, nothing much different.

Cui Dongshan looked around, the green mountains stretching endlessly.

A single person murmured, and the mountains echoed back.

One could only hope so.

Cui Dongshan sighed.

Finally, he was willing to leave.

He still had to meet a significant figure on behalf of that old bastard. 

In a flash of white clothing, he soared into the air, crashing through the entire sea of clouds, with thunder rumbling like a farewell in the heavens. 

Meanwhile, Pei Qian, walking through the mountains and forests, originally joyfully chanting her way through, suddenly paused, quickly turning around, raising her head, and bouncing as she waved goodbye with all her might.

The water god realized that even when the little girl reached the county town, she never stayed at an inn.

The most she did was buy some snacks, keeping some in her pocket and more in her small bamboo box.

Moreover, she would visit various water shrines and temples to pay her respects, and if she encountered Daoist temples, she would light incense.

Aside from that, she rarely spoke to anyone, merely walking through the mountains and rivers at a much slower pace, without the need to rush.

The only time she lingered for a long while was when she squatted on a low earthen wall, gazing longingly at a group of horseback Jianghu heroes. The little girl appeared somewhat envious.

But it wasn’t the impressive-looking Jianghu figures that caught her eye; it was their mounts.

On the side of the Yu River in Huang Ting Kingdom, the little girl merely glanced before bolting away. Near the Cao family’s Zhilian Pavilion, she did the same, sneaking a couple of peeks before running off.

Finally, she reached the borders of Hongzhu Town.

The water god felt a sense of relief while also finding it somewhat laughable. With the little girl being so cautious, did she really need his protection all the way?

Was it truly so fortunate to have obtained a rare talisman? Would she really get that no-incident talisman from Dali?

The water god couldn’t believe it, but it didn’t matter; he followed the white-clad youth’s instructions and stopped there, ready to return home!

As the water god turned to leave, he noticed the little girl sprinting toward him from a distance. She stopped a short distance away, planted her mountain staff firmly into the ground, and then clasped her fists with a smile, bowing to him.

Once the water god returned the gesture, she grinned widely, "My master is the lord of Ruining Mountain, and you are always welcome to visit our home!"

The water god froze for a moment before nodding.

Had this little girl forgotten to introduce herself?

But the little girl had already pulled up her staff, turned around, and skipped away, shaking the small bamboo box on her back.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 753: The One Who Wishes to Support Heaven, Please Rise

In the desolate mountains, evening clouds hinted at snow.

Zhu Lian had a lot on his mind.

Today, while Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafu played chess, they exchanged complaints. Zhu Lian grumbled that his brother Dafu's earnest gaze had scared off the celestial maiden, Huang Ting, while Zheng Dafu blamed the old cook for his lackluster culinary skills, which failed to retain the maiden. They lamented that Lupo Mountain had unjustly lost a registered supporter who was a Yuan Ying sword cultivator, a grave offense indeed. To atone, they felt compelled to hand over several treasured texts from the immortals to Zheng Dafu for safekeeping.

Wei Ban sat nearby, puzzled as to why, even after all this time, the two continued their quarrel. Then he realized: Was it that beautiful maiden, Huang Ting, captivating enough to warrant such fuss?

Zhu Lian turned to Wei Ban and asked with a smile, “I’ve heard you’re heading to the capital soon to pay respects to the Emperor. Perhaps you can score some dragon energy to bring back for our blessed land. That’s what I call purposeful travel!”

Zheng Dafu chimed in, “Indeed, the Mountain Lord can’t just lounge around watching chess without contributing!”

Wei Ban felt helpless; the title of North Peak Mountain Lord had even reached the ears of North Julu Continent. No passing wild chicken could lay an egg without permission.

However, their efforts had not been in vain. The latest lotus root blessed land had recently transitioned into a medium blessed land after investing several thousand Gu Yu coins. It was now brimming with new landscapes, spirits, and the nascent forms of heroic deities, flourishing like bamboo shoots after rain. Yet, overall numbers were still capped by a bottleneck.

But as long as enough divine coins were invested, the skies would widen and the fortunes would thicken, naturally breaking through any prior limitations.

What intrigued Zheng Dafu most was a popular romantic novel from the Southern Garden Kingdom, where a woman, gifted with ethereal charm, manifested in the mortal realm. She was born from collective human sentiment, yet her spiritual awareness was still not fully realized, leaving her somewhat dazed, drifting among books and paintings while quietly observing the unfamiliar world.

Her appearance was a rarity in the grand scheme of things.

She was quite different from the young girl, Chen Nuanshu.

This woman, who had never possessed a true form, was a manifestation of countless sentiments from all eras and corners, a rather unconventional “manifestation of the Dao.” 

Yet, even if unconventional, it was still a remarkable manifestation of the Dao, and merely touching upon the concept of the Dao was no small matter.

If discovered in other blessed lands, she would certainly be captured, with no shortage of buyers willing to pay exorbitant prices.

Fortunately, she was born in the Lotus Root blessed land, under the governance of such a principled young mountain lord, ensuring her future luck would be quite favorable.

Zheng Dafu wiped his mouth. “A remarkable talent and spirit of the land, worth a visit! A timid yet delicate young lady and a gallant hero—both are indispensable, lest we fall victim to the clutches of those lonely spirits and malevolent ghosts.”

Zhu Lian, however, stated, “I think keeping her on the mountain would be just fine.”

Deep down, Zhu Lian harbored a significant concern; the Lotus Flower blessed land of yesteryears, now the Lotus Root blessed land, left him with a lingering sense that the old temple master’s schemes were far-reaching.

Once someone entered a blessed land, regardless of who they were, it wouldn’t be an easy journey.

Wei Ban added, “If we’ve chosen a leisurely life, we might as well enjoy it to the fullest until we grow old.”

Zheng Dafu laughed, “What are you thinking? Our Lupo Mountain is brimming with talented individuals. It’s not that I need to exert myself; it’s truly just for a stroll and to clear our minds.”

In truth, Zheng Dafu was stronger in chess than both Zhu Lian and Wei Ban, so playing was quite easy for him. As Zhu Lian pondered deeply over his next move, Zheng Dafu lifted a folding fan from the table, fanning himself in the winter chill. It seemed absurd. He only needed to pretend; after a quick flick of the wrist, he tucked it away. Such a refined item in the hands of a handsome man like him was simply extraordinary; any woman with eyes wouldn’t dislike it. If someone claimed to dislike it, they were likely pretending.

At that moment on Lupo Mountain, aside from Pei Qian still wandering outside, the old scholar had taken Cao Qinglang to the Southern Posa Continent for a trip. The atmosphere was quite lively, as Yuan Lai had recently chosen to remain on the mountain for cultivation. Zheng Dafu genuinely wished to guide the young girl Yuan Bao in her boxing techniques, but unfortunately, she was too shy and timid, preferring to learn from an old man. Young Yuan Lai wanted to learn from Zheng Dafu, but Zheng Dafu was hesitant, only sharing some miscellaneous knowledge from books. Yuan Lai had been advised by her sister many times on this.

Moreover, there were now three unnamed disciples residing at the Sword Offering Platform of Lupo Mountain.

These three were genuine outsiders from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Jindan sword cultivator Cui Wei.

And two shop assistants from a certain store, Zhang Jiazhen and Jiang Qu.

The three hadn’t arrived via the ferry from the old dragon city to North Julu Continent, but had instead taken a short ferry northward, then traversed what was said to be an underground river carved by a true dragon, carrying three travel documents and a peace talisman from the Great Li dynasty. They traveled northward, passing through Hongzhu Town and Qidun Mountain, finally entering the territory of Lupo Mountain.

Ultimately, under Zhu Lian’s arrangement, they settled at the Sword Offering Platform in silence.

Since the three were only considered registered disciples of Lupo Mountain for the time being, they didn’t need to offer incense or hang their portraits.

With the lavish spending of the veneration Zhou Fei, all the subordinate mountain residences of Lupo Mountain were undergoing grand construction. As Zhou Fei put it, “Whatever is expensive, bring it! Don’t save money for me. Where does the mountain’s celestial energy come from? It’s all built up from the heaviest copper stench of divine coins, one by one!”

Cui Wei especially concealed his identity; given his recent journey, he had a rough understanding of the value of a Jindan cultivator in the vast world. An ordinary Jindan Qi cultivator could hold a peak ceremony, which would be immensely valued by the celestial sects of the vast realm, let alone a sword cultivator destined to become Yuan Ying.

However, Cui Wei was even more reserved than Zhang Jiazhen and Jiang Qu, almost timid.

Cui Wei left the Sword Qi Great Wall with little more than his own life-protecting flying sword, a robe from a clothing store, and a long sword from the sword workshop.

Zhang Jiazhen had received a handwritten calligraphy piece from Mr. Chen, titled “Rain for the Day, Sun for the Night,” stamped with two seals.

Jiang Qu received a stack of talismans gifted by Mr. Chen, among which was a golden talisman.

Zheng Dafu asked, “Old cook, are we just leaving those two young ones at the Sword Offering Platform? I think that’s not right. We should send them to the New Year shop to pick up some energy from the crowd.”

Wei Ban laughed and replied, “You can’t say that, Zhang Jiazhen and Jiang Qu are both from urban backgrounds; they’re not lacking in this regard.”

Zheng Dafu chuckled, “I just thought that Zhang Jiazhen looks quite decent and wanted to match him up with Xiao Jiu’er. We’ve been freezing in bed every night—how comfortable is that? Do we really want these younger ones to follow in our footsteps? I don’t think so; absolutely not.”

The New Year shop housed three registered disciples: the blind old Daoist Jia Cheng, the limping young man Zhao Denggao, and the young girl Tian Jiu’er.

Zhu Lian smiled, “Those two outsiders at the Sword Offering Platform should have a bright future, though they may take longer to mature. We need to be patient.”

Wei Ban added, “Even if they want to be unambitious, they need to consider Zhou Fei’s divine coins. Will the gods agree?”

Zhu Lian and Zheng Dafu nodded in unison, “That makes sense.”

Zheng Dafu said, “Let’s have Nuanshu write this down. Next time we gather at the Ancestor Hall, we’ll pull it out and show it to Brother Zhou Fei.”

After finishing her tasks, Chen Nuanshu came over to watch the chess game.

Chen Lingjun yawned as he entered the courtyard, spotting Chen Nuanshu, and grinned, “Little silly girl, haven’t you refined that Dragon King’s lantern yet?”

Years ago, before Chen Pingan left Lupo Mountain, he had given the pair of Dragon King lanterns from the ruins of the North Julu Continent to both Chen Nuanshu and Chen Lingjun for them to refine, as a means to safeguard the Huang Lake Mountain of Lupo Mountain. Chen Lingjun had already successfully refined his, but Chen Nuanshu was progressing slowly. However, this slowness was only relative to Chen Lingjun. A fellow who almost got taken by Lu Chen to cultivate in the Qingming realm wouldn’t have poor aptitude.

Chen Nuanshu’s expression dimmed as she fell silent, her small hands gripping her sleeves tightly.

Wei Ban reached out and gently patted Chen Lingjun’s head, bending down with a smile to ask, “What’s wrong?”

Chen Lingjun blinked and replied earnestly, “Nuanshu, in cultivation, diligence is enough. Don’t rush; being hasty can lead to mistakes. We should learn from our lord, taking things slow so that our punches come out fast.”

Wei Ban patted Chen Lingjun’s head again, “If you keep talking without a filter like this, once Pei Qian returns to Lupo Mountain, you’ll have to deal with it yourself.”

Chen Lingjun nearly kneeled before Wei Ban, quickly standing on his toes, placing his hands on Wei Ban’s shoulders, smiling ingratiatingly, urging the seated Wei Ban to sit down so he could help massage the Mountain Lord’s shoulders.

The North Julu Continent’s Taihui Sword Sect was a top-tier sect! The sword immortal Qi Jinglong’s direct disciple Bai Shou—how impressive!

Yet, with one kick from Pei Qian, he was left lying on the ground, twitching.

The most terrifying thing was that Pei Qian held grudges.

Cen Yuanshi, Yuan Bao, and Yuan Lai, during their training breaks, also came to the courtyard to unwind. 

As soon as they arrived, they noticed Chen Lingjun, helping Wei Ban massage his shoulders while praising Brother Dafu’s elegant demeanor. If that fan were to gain sentience, it would surely be grateful to shed tears, thanking its previous life for accumulating virtues, allowing it to end up in Brother Dafu’s hands in this life.

Chen Nuanshu made room, but Cen Yuanshi and young Yuan Lai didn’t sit down. Yuan Bao expressed his gratitude and took a seat.

Chen Lingjun rolled his eyes.

This little girl picked up by Lu Baixiang had no sense whatsoever.

Look at all the exceptional talents my lord brought in; how could anyone not be outstanding?

Just think about that little girl, right now still squatting by Qidun Mountain, eagerly waiting for Pei Qian, clutching a large bag of seeds. The little girl's conscience was bigger than a bowl.

Yuan Bao was merely lucky; he arrived at Lupo Mountain late, and all the extraordinary individuals had been dealt with by the venerable Chen himself, who had fought for the path of vitality. Otherwise, with Yuan Bao’s temperament, he would have been smacked down long ago during his walks.

Zhu Lian smiled and asked, “Yuan Bao, do you have something to say?”

Yuan Bao nodded, “I can wait until Mr. Zhu finishes his chess game.”

Although the girl was sharp-tongued, she was still polite.

Moreover, Yuan Bao had a good impression of the elder Zhu Lian. The one he disliked was Zheng Dafu, and the one he felt indifferent about was the Mountain Lord who frequently visited Lupo Mountain for no reason.

Previously, when Mr. Zhu had traveled to the Lotus Root blessed land, he had only brought back a scroll hidden in a secret place, an exquisite work from a master painter from his hometown.

Prosperous, bustling, a scene of great vitality.

At that time, Pei Qian had sharp eyes and noticed that there were fewer horses and more yellow cattle and donkeys in the painting, leading him to exclaim, “So many little donkeys, if I grit my teeth and take out a snowflake coin, could I buy a hundred of them?”

Yuan Bao and Yuan Lai were also present, with Yuan Lai searching for the bookstore in the painting, while Yuan Bao glanced at the painting and sneered, declaring it a display of decline.

Zhu Lian nodded; this perspective made sense.

In fact, the painting depicted the very capital where Zhu Lian resided. Within less than sixty years, all the beauty and prosperity had been trampled into dust by horse hooves.

Even though Zhu Lian had exerted every effort, he still couldn’t turn the tide. Eventually, he left the political arena and returned to the rivers and lakes, transforming from a noble heir into a cultured general, ultimately becoming a martial madman.

In that lifetime, Zhu Lian had three proud moments.

Writing books. Zhu Lian’s small script was something even Cui Dongshan admired greatly.

He pioneered double-entry bookkeeping.

He casually wrote a martial arts manual with a low threshold for entry, allowing for quick breakthroughs, yet reaching the pinnacle was incredibly difficult. He wrote ninety-nine volumes, giving them away freely, sparking a scramble among those in the martial world.

Scholars, common folk, the rivers and lakes.

Looking back on his life, whether as the noble Zhu Lian or the martial madman Zhu Lian, he had found closure.

Zhu Lian placed the white piece he was about to drop back into the box and smiled, “Yuan Bao, the chess game is currently too close to call. Let’s finish this game first; you can speak your mind.”

Zheng Dafu continued to crack sunflower seeds.

Wei Ban remained quiet. In a chess match, as long as Zhu Lian didn’t deliberately take a long time to think, Zheng Dafu would wrap up the game within a few moves.

Yuan Bao began, “I have some thoughts regarding the Lotus Root blessed land. I’ll speak freely; if I’m wrong, please forgive me, Mr. Zhu.”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “Feel free to speak. Whether right or wrong isn’t solely up to me; we can discuss it, argue, and reason with each other.”

Yuan Bao appreciated the elder’s open-mindedness and straightforwardness, allowing him to interact without restraint.

In a serious tone, Yuan Bao said, “We should directly publish some simple celestial techniques into books and have the emperors of the four nations issue edicts mandating that everyone must study them. We could promote martial arts manuals in the same way; with no entry barriers, even those with poor aptitude who can’t cultivate celestial techniques can still walk the path of martial arts. Whether they succeed or not, they will at least have had the opportunity. Otherwise, after we’ve invested so many Gu Yu coins, are we just here for the spectacle? We must at least see some profit, right?”

Yuan Lai whispered, “If we’re causing chaos with martial arts, it will be troublesome for the imperial government. The entire Lotus Root blessed land will become hard to control. If we’re not careful, the government will become merely decorative. If the government and the imperial court lose their authority, it will create significant issues for the entire landscape system. Cao Qinglang once said, ‘No matter how small a realm is, it requires stability.’”

Yuan Bao scoffed, “If those old emperors and officials won’t do their jobs or can’t do them well, then simply replace them with a batch of obedient puppets. Those who dare to kill can keep the mountain cultivators in check and deal with the masters of the rivers and lakes. If we really fear that place is small, we can always take the good seedlings directly from the blessed land and raise them at Lupo Mountain. With so many peaks and celestial residences, they’ll just sit empty. For instance, those who have hopes of advancing to the cave realm and are already at the sixth stage of martial arts can become our unnamed disciples at Lupo Mountain. Once they’ve accumulated enough merit, they can earn positions and learn better boxing techniques and higher celestial techniques.”

Yuan Lai’s voice grew even softer, “But what about human feelings? It’s not that simple. Sister, just on our master’s side, there are so many complicated relationships.”

Yuan Bao glared at his bookish younger brother, feeling utterly exasperated! No wonder he got along so well with Cao Qinglang.

Zhu Lian remained silent.

The girl’s words couldn’t be said to be entirely right or entirely wrong. However, some things are intricately connected, not merely a matter of adding or subtracting techniques, but more like constructing a building; if one beam is askew, over time, the whole structure may collapse.

Nonetheless, it’s beneficial to think and speak more, so Zhu Lian did not rush to refute or endorse anything and simply smiled at the girl, encouraging her to be bold and share her thoughts.

Yuan Bao crossed his arms and squinted, “The reason our master is constrained is due to the chaotic situation. The Lotus Root blessed land is different; here, we at Lupo Mountain are the gods of this blessed land! As a person, who wouldn’t fear death and cherish their life! Our vast world possesses profound techniques and magical powers. In this grand scheme, who cares about human emotions? Perhaps those seeking to affiliate with us at Lupo Mountain will be the last thing on their minds.”

Zheng Dafu chuckled, “In childhood, I feared the difficulty of studying; in youth, I thought it was easy to be human.”

Young Yuan Lai silently took this to heart. Uncle Zheng's knowledge was indeed vast.

Zhu Lian scratched his head and sighed, “Yesterday’s child rode a bamboo horse, and tonight, how is it that he has become a white-haired elder?”

Wei Ban asked with a smile, “Yuan Bao, I have a question. Once these people arrive in the vast world and are nurtured at Lupo Mountain, what will they do?”

Yuan Bao had long prepared an answer and said without hesitation, “They will continue cultivating or encourage them to practice martial arts. As long as the Qi cultivators become Dragon Gate realm cultivators or seventh-stage martial arts masters, they can be sold to various powers in the Baopin Continent, establishing good connections and earning substantial wealth. Those with high aspirations who refuse to be treated as goods can sign contracts with us at Lupo Mountain. After they leave, they can agree on a period of ten, twenty, or even a hundred years, allowing them to buy their freedom with money!”

Wei Ban inquired further, “If among these people, someone commits evil or causes chaos, who takes responsibility for this muddled account?”

Yuan Bao frowned, “What does that matter? In the rivers and lakes, life and death are their own responsibility. If they suffer misfortune, it’s their own fault. Those who lack the ability will be trampled by others. The world has always been this way! Why should we take the blame at Lupo Mountain?”

Zhu Lian remained unperturbed.

Zheng Dafu rolled his eyes.

Wei Ban twirled the golden earring between his fingers, feeling somewhat troubled.

Lu Baixiang’s teaching of disciples was truly worry-free.

Yuan Bao clenched his fists, speaking solemnly, “In the Lotus Root blessed land, we are the gods, overseeing them. Those who follow will thrive, while those who oppose will perish! Once they leave Lupo Mountain, they will have no more connection with us, only business dealings. This world was built by our thousands of Gu Yu coins, creating a thriving environment! We must continue to invest, pouring in even more Gu Yu coins—on what grounds?”

Yuan Bao was somewhat agitated, “The formation of those heavenly treasures is far too slow, and the gathering of spiritual energy into a cultivation treasure land will take ages! Are we to suffer losses indefinitely? My master’s earning is not easy; it’s challenging! Unlike some people, who sit atop the mountain, basking in the sun, playing chess, and enjoying the snow.”

Zhu Lian smiled and waved his hand, “Yuan Bao, at Lupo Mountain, not to mention our current discussion, even in future arguments, we must keep in mind ‘discuss matters as they are.’ Otherwise, being right will mean nothing.”

Yuan Bao nodded, “I’ll heed Mr. Zhu’s words.”

Zheng Dafu, cracking sunflower seeds, found himself feeling a bit guilty after the girl’s words.

Yuan Bao took a deep breath, his gaze resolute, glancing at Zheng Dafu and Wei Ban, “If either of you finds them displeasing, I’ll take responsibility for dealing with them, as though raising a useless waste of space.”

Cen Yuanshi hoped her good sister would say less, so she had been signaling for quite a while, but her eyelids were growing heavier by the second.

At this moment, Cen Yuanshi started to rub her eyes.

Yuan Bao gently squeezed Cen Yuanshi’s arm, signaling that he understood her feelings.

Among all of Lupo Mountain, only Cen Yuanshi was the most pleasing to him; she was a friend. The rest were either useless or deceitful, or they simply acted frivolously and lacked a sense of purpose. Well, Nuanshu was an exception; she was diligent and peaceful, which made her quite endearing.

Zhu Lian said, “Yuan Bao, I have a rough understanding of your thoughts, and I’ve made a note of them. Don’t worry; I won’t let this just sit idly. Perhaps at the next Ancestor Hall meeting, your ideas will be discussed individually. The Ancestor Hall’s discussions are not a joke; every word is recorded, so it’s best for you to consider them carefully in the near future to avoid any loopholes being pointed out later. I have a suggestion; do you want to hear it?”

Yuan Bao smiled, “Please, Mr. Zhu!”

Zhu Lian glanced at the timid young Yuan Lai and said, “Since Yuan Lai has some objections, you should set aside your sister’s airs and try to be more calm. If you can convince Yuan Lai, do you think you’ll truly have the confidence to bring this matter to the Ancestor Hall? Is that reasonable?”

Yuan Bao thought for a moment and nodded, “Alright!”

Zhu Lian continued, “Outside of the Ancestor Hall, all paths of cultivation may proceed as they wish, but once seated in the Ancestor Hall, everyone’s words must be carefully considered. This isn’t me acting like an elder or targeting you, Yuan Bao, or thinking the girl’s brilliance is too bright and needs dimming. We at Lupo Mountain have no such chaotic rules now, nor will we in the future.”

Yuan Bao smiled, “Mr. Zhu has always been open-minded; I won’t overthink it.”

Zheng Dafu sighed deeply.

Whatever the old cook says, the girl seems to take it all in stride.

So many celestial texts, all of which the old cook has bought and hidden in the mountains—why is it only I who am a carefree wastrel?

People are more alive than the living.

Yuan Bao, along with his friends Cen Yuanshi and the dense younger brother, left the courtyard in high spirits.

Chen Lingjun muttered, “That little girl is so domineering.”

Zhu Lian smiled, “Lupo Mountain should have such thoughts. The more we prepare for battles and competitions, the better. So I’ll make it clear with you all beforehand: no matter the final outcome of the Ancestor Hall discussions, we must not hurt the girl’s feelings.”

Wei Ban shook his head, “This move may not be without merit; in fact, many blessed lands in the vast world operate on this principle. Following this approach, it may even be more direct than Yuan Bao’s proposal. On one hand, it’s somewhat mercantile and carries a poor reputation, making it incredibly difficult to become a candidate for the sect, let alone ascend to a proper sect. On the other hand, as Yuan Lai worries, Yuan Bao still underestimates human sentiment. The more seeds of the Dao or martial talents one has, not to say all, but most will rebel and turn against Lupo Mountain. Ultimately, it’s easy to overreach and fish in a dry pond.”

Zheng Dafu remarked, “The little girl is still at an early stage of martial arts. For her to have such vision is quite impressive.”

Wei Ban suddenly grew somber.

Zheng Dafu asked, “Did something happen to the little girl?”

Earlier, Wei Ban had merely sensed a subtle feeling, but now he activated his divine sense to observe the mountains and rivers.

He hadn’t anticipated that Chen Lingjun had already taken to the winds, soaring from Lupo Mountain like a green rainbow.

Wei Ban chuckled, “Pei Qian is already protecting that little girl.”

Zhu Lian’s expression remained indifferent. “Wei Ban, you don’t need to meddle; let Lupo Mountain handle it.”

Wei Ban didn’t take it to heart, nodding, “I’ll intervene; otherwise, it would be harder to manage. Just as I need to go to the capital for discussions, I’ll leave first. You all continue as you wish.”

Zhu Lian suddenly became fidgety, “That would be too rude, quite embarrassing.”

Wei Ban asked with a smile, “Then should I leave later?”

Zhu Lian had already risen, “Mountain Lord matters are pressing. The sooner you leave, the sooner you return. It’s best to bring back some windfall.”

Wei Ban’s figure shimmered and vanished in an instant, appearing thousands of miles away.

Zheng Dafu gestured for Nuanshu not to be nervous, nor to follow Chen Lingjun to the confluence of the three rivers at Hongzhu Town.

Zheng Dafu continued to crack sunflower seeds.

Could Lupo Mountain allow people to bully them on their own territory? What a joke.

Then Zheng Dafu rubbed his chin, grateful that the young mountain lord wasn’t on the mountain. Otherwise, based on Chen Pingan’s temperament now, he would likely throw a punch first and find a quiet place to break a river, and then reason things out.

The Emperor’s study in the Great Li dynasty wasn’t particularly large.

However, to enter and sit down for a discussion, one had to have a sufficiently large official hat or a high enough cultivation level.

The young Emperor Song He was meditating with his eyes closed. Today, he had made an exception and canceled the morning court session in preparation for the upcoming discussions.

Furthermore, the situation was special, with mostly cultivators present and only a few officials from the Great Li dynasty—just the Minister of Rites and two deputies.

Song He opened his eyes, realizing he still had about a stick of incense’s worth of time. The young Emperor glanced at the desk, where there lay a landscape painting by Li Yingqiu, which had been placed there by the former emperor. After inheriting the throne, Song He had not removed anything from the room but had added a few items, only to feel it was becoming cluttered and secretly removed some.

The container for Li Yingqiu’s landscape painting was a green porcelain pen holder made from the Longyao kiln in Lihuzhou, which was rather obtrusive.

Li Yingqiu wasn’t a mountain dweller; the arts from the lower realms had never caught the attention of the celestial families, but there were exceptions. Li Yingqiu was an unavoidable figure in the history of painting of the Great Sui dynasty, not only favored by the Great Li Song family but also appreciated by many celestial families on Baopin Continent.

Besides Li Yingqiu’s meticulous green landscape, there were also wild flower-and-bird paintings.

Song He glanced at the scrolls in the pen holder, wanting to apologize to Li Yingqiu, feeling sorry for the elder’s landscape painting being placed next to this person’s flower-and-bird painting.

Song He had a very poor impression of Bian Ye, both in terms of his paintings and character, finding him unworthy of regard. He was a down-and-out painter from the previous Lu dynasty, who had wandered to the vassal state of Great Li, becoming one of the few outsiders to settle here. Thus, he was highly valued by that generation’s Great Li Emperor. All his paintings bore the seals of the consecutive Great Li emperors. Bian Ye probably never expected that within a century of his death, he would inexplicably become a revered figure in the painting world of Baopin Continent, hailed as “most adept at the beauty of wildflowers and birds, with exquisite colors so lifelike,” and “exceptionally skillful, a standard of ancient and modern.” Countless praises surged forth.

When Song He was younger, he attended lessons here with some princes. Some shared his views, saying Bian Ye’s paintings were indeed overly extravagant; the former emperor didn’t provide any evaluations of the paintings, simply stating that no matter who became the owner of this room, they must keep Bian Ye’s works, regardless of preference.

However, among the pen holder was a calligraphy piece that was an actual treasure, titled “Returning Home Is Better Than Never Returning.”

It could even be regarded as the first treasure of this Great Li study.

It was a piece written by Song He’s teacher, the national master of the Great Li dynasty, Cui Zhan. Of course, it was a genuine work.

Cui Zhan’s calligraphy, especially in running and cursive scripts, was renowned and considered worth its weight in gold across the vast world.

Once the first disciple of the Confucian Sage lineage, Embroidered Tiger Cui Zhan, deserved that title, just as Chen Chun’an of Posa Continent deserved his title of “refined Confucian.”

Cui Zhan had four pieces from the flower collection, four from the cloud collection, four from the spring collection, and four from the mountain collection, totaling sixteen pieces of calligraphy that have survived. 

These sixteen scrolls scattered across the nine continents, all falling into the hands of renowned collectors, including one notable mountain cultivator from the central continent who deeply connected with Cui Zhan, expending massive resources to purchase two pieces, the “Beggar Seeking Rice” and the “Seat Contention,” publicly destroying them, which was considered a great feat, pleasing the masses.

Only a century later did the truth come to light: this self-proclaimed “the best in the world at despising Cui Zhan” old cultivator was revealed by his descendants, exposing that this old scoundrel merely destroyed two counterfeits while secretly hoarding the genuine pieces for his family.

Additionally, it was said that the Liu family from Aiyai Continent, the Bai Emperor City, the Yushi family from the central continent, and Jiang Shangzhen from Yuguizong all had one in their collections.

Cui Zhan stepped in and bowed, “Your Majesty, we may begin our discussion.”

This was a rite of courtesy between sovereign and subject.

The young emperor immediately rose and returned the gesture, a courtesy between teacher and student.

In truth, this was unnecessary; Song He had never deviated from this, even in front of the senior ministers of the small court assembly.

Not long after Cui Zhan took his seat, the three of them from the Ministry of Rites stood to pay their respects and then took their seats.

Then came the various mountain dwellers from the Baopin Continent.

The head of the Shengaosong sect, a Daoist immortal, the Great Heavenly Lord Qi Zhen.

The chief veneration of Great Li, the sect master of Longquan Sword Sect, Ruan Qiong.

The founder of the Wind and Snow Temple, an immortal looking like a youth; the last time he appeared in the realm was during the three competitions at Fenglei Garden and Zhengyang Mountain.

From Zhenwu Mountain, a man who had just been promoted to the head of the Ancestor Hall, with a sword on his back.

In the eyes of outsiders, Zhenwu Mountain only needed a Ma Kuxuan to ensure a bright future.

In fact, Wind and Snow Temple was not lacking either, having a deity named Wei Jin, with the only shortcoming being that Wei Jin had little concern for Wind and Snow Temple due to his master’s influence, keeping a distance from it. Now he had gone to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Otherwise, today could have seen the presence of Sword Immortal Wei Jin.

The chief veneration of Zhenjing Sect, Liu Lao Cheng, who was of the wild cultivator lineage from Shujian Lake.

A great gentleman from Guanh Lake Academy.

The mountain master of Piyun Mountain’s Deer Academy.

The lord of Old Dragon City, Fu Qi.

The founder of the Great Sui dynasty, the ancestor of the Ge Yang Gao family.

Only four of the new Five Peaks mountain lords arrived today, including North Peak Wei Ban and Central Peak Jin Qing.

Only South Peak Fan Junmao was absent.

The master of the Mohist School.

A wandering Mohist ranger, Xu Ruo, behind the sword.

An elder from the Jiang family of Yunlin.

Two water deities from the central region of Baopin Continent.

It was rumored that they were gathering the waters from six rivers and twelve streams, ultimately merging them to flow into the sea as a great deluge!

It seems this shocking rumor was no mere empty talk.

The clan head of the Xu family from Qingfeng City, after acquiring a piece of leprosy armor, became significantly more powerful, with enormous killing power.

A young woman from Zhengyang Mountain, said to be a recently appointed elder in charge of financial dealings, was relatively unknown compared to the older sword cultivators from Zhengyang Mountain.

Today, she found herself in the last seat.

In comparison to the leaders of several older powers from Great Li, she was seated even further back.

Logically, Zhengyang Mountain and Qingfeng City’s Xu family were deeply allied, but the Xu family head had been waiting elsewhere for a summons. Upon seeing the Zhengyang woman next to him, he merely nodded in acknowledgment, too lazy to engage in any pleasantries.

In contrast, she took the initiative to bow and then took her seat.

A total of thirty-six cultivators and deities gathered, most engaged in mutual conversation. For example, the Jiang family and the Fu family of Old Dragon City were in-laws, while the Xu family of Qingfeng City were in-laws with the Yuan family. The Minister of Rites’ right deputy was also somewhat related, and the Minister of Rites sat beside Ruan Qiong, engaging in friendly dialogue. Wei Ban and Jin Qing, the two mountain lords, were exchanging barbs. The other two new mountain lords seemed to be on good terms as they discussed important matters. Qi Zhen and the Mohist giant were in deep conversation. Even the ancestor of the Ge Yang Gao family had been hiding away in Piyun Mountain for years, and with the great gentleman from Guanh Lake Academy, they could chat about academic matters.

Sadly, this Zhengyang woman found herself without anyone she could converse with.

Cui Zhan stood up and spoke straightforwardly, “Today, I have summoned everyone here to discuss ten matters.”

Within the room and outside, it felt like two separate worlds.

Everyone held their breath, focused, without any signs of laxity.

Aside from the discussions today being related to everyone present, the Great Li National Master’s enigmatic realm was also critical.

As for the three key figures from the Ministry of Rites, they appeared as students listening to their teacher’s teachings.

Cui Zhan continued, “The first matter is that the court will soon issue the next mountain lord to assist the heirs of the Five Peaks.”

The four mountain lords listened attentively; this was a fundamental issue of the Dao.

In fact, this matter was not only about the affairs of the Five Peaks but also about the personal interests of everyone present.

The Minister of Rites stood up, opened a book, and began to call names.

After he finished the last word, he looked at Cui Zhan, who had been standing, and once Cui Zhan nodded, the old Minister of Rites sat down.

Cui Zhan said, “The second matter is to select several candidate sects that are widely supported.”

The head of the Xu family from Qingfeng City straightened his back and sat upright.

The Zhengyang woman hurriedly composed herself.

Women often find it especially difficult to meet the gaze of Ruan Qiong, the sect master of Longquan Sword Sect.

Even when waiting for the emperor’s summons, she hadn’t glanced at Ruan Qiong.

The reason was simple: Zhengyang Mountain wished to become a sect, which required them to absorb the sword Dao’s fortunes of the entire Zhu Ying Dynasty, needing to establish an immortal sect residence there to recruit and gather all the sword Dao talents.

In the end, the four candidate mountain sects, including the Xu family of Qingfeng City and Zhengyang Mountain, had hopes of entering the sect ranks; in the future, the Great Li court would naturally tilt its financial resources toward them.

The third matter is to discuss the excavation of the great flood leading into the sea and to nominate the various celestial masters responsible for assisting this task.

The two water deities of the great river, currently of equal rank with the Tiefu River’s Yang Hua, couldn’t hide their excitement. 

Although today’s discussions wouldn’t decide who would take the position of the great flood water deity, being invited to participate in today’s discussions was already a significant honor.

In addition, the Great Li court had designated three individuals: the scholar Liu Qingfeng, the martial general Guan Yiran, and Liu Xunmei.

Other assisted candidates were all mountain cultivators from the nearby peaks of the future great flood, each offering their suggestions.

Moreover, the elder from the Jiang family felt this trip wasn’t in vain, as the mouth of the great flood was extremely close to the Jiang family’s territory. Thus, he also proposed a Jiang family disciple, Jiang Yun, to participate.

Liu Lao Cheng, the veneration from Zhenjing Sect, smiled knowingly.

The fourth matter is to filter through the shrines and temples of various mountains and waters, upgrading them to orthodox temples, with the court issuing corresponding decrees. The cultivators of various mountains will assist in adding incense. If any are deemed lewd shrines, they will be immediately prohibited and destroyed, with the various mountain heads responsible for suppressing them.

The two deputies from the Ministry of Rites read through their respective content.

The fifth matter is to relocate the Great Li capital, which is modeled after the White Jade Capital, to the former Zhu Ying Dynasty’s Central Peak territory.

The Mohist giant stood up and briefly mentioned some points of caution.

Those below the thirteenth realm can all be killed. The one responsible for guarding the White Jade Capital is a long-time acquaintance of the Central Peak’s mountain lord, Jin Qing, the Mohist ranger Xu Ruo.

The sixth matter is to discuss the tax that all celestial forces in Baopin Continent must pay to the Great Li court.

Immediately, the study fell silent.

Cui Zhan spoke, “This matter is complex, and wanting to cover all bases cannot be settled in a day or two. Today, I only need to know whether you agree or disagree. If you agree, someone will work out the details later. If you disagree, we’ll set it aside for now. The Great Li court will not deliberately target anyone in the near future. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree, you will receive a book upon leaving, detailing everything. There will be slight differences for the various mountains, but they won’t be significant. You all need not rush to express your opinions today; this is merely to inform you, with a maximum buffer period of one year.”

The seventh matter is regarding the Great Li dynasty borrowing people and money from the various mountain heads, as well as how to repay this debt. Furthermore, each mountain head needs to send cultivators down the mountain to gain experience, “appeasing” the remnants of the fallen dynasties and the old royal families, inviting them to temporarily stay in the Great Li capital. If they enjoy the local customs, they are welcome to dwell for a long time.

The eighth matter is to discuss the revival of Buddhist teachings in Baopin Continent and the construction of temples. A certain eminent monk will serve as the main official.

Hearing this, the Great Heavenly Lord Qi Zhen frowned.

The ninth matter is that the Great Sui Mountain Cliff Academy must return to the ranks of the Confucian seventy-two academies, and if possible, Lin Deer Academy should also strive to compete.

The ancestor of the Ge Yang Gao family felt immensely satisfied.

One by one, the matters and agendas were rapidly advanced under Cui Zhan’s leadership.

The young emperor, Song He, merely sat behind the desk, showing no signs of anger at the national master’s encroachment. Instead, he appeared invigorated.

Cui Zhan stated, “The previous nine matters were all in preparation for the final tenth matter, which is crucial for everyone present, including His Majesty the Emperor.”

With a sweep of his sleeve, a map of the entire continent’s mountains and rivers unfolded before everyone’s eyes.

All the critical peaks and sects appeared like lights igniting on the canvas.

Cui Zhan continued, “We need to discuss how to arrange defensive lines for Baopin Continent in light of the Sword Qi Great Wall being breached, leading to the collapse of the entire Tongye Continent against the advancing demonic army.”

The five sacred peaks of the continent commanded the mountain ranges, while the central great flood gathered the continent’s waterways.

The Guanh Lake Academy, Mountain Cliff Academy, and Lin Deer Academy were the centers of literature and culture in the continent.

The Shengaosong sect, Longquan Sword Sect, Wind and Snow Temple, Zhenwu Mountain, Old Dragon City, Yunlin Jiang family, Shujian Lake Zhenjing sect, Zhengyang Mountain, and the Xu family of Qingfeng City were all key defensive strongholds.

Moreover, the various vassal forces and scattered mountain ranges across the land were all rooted and immovable pieces on the board.

Cui Zhan asserted, “Simply having a series of coastal defenses, like Old Dragon City and the Yunlin Jiang family, will be far from sufficient. We also need sufficient strategic depth and mutual support between the mountains.”

“Using points to form lines, then to form areas, is still not enough; it’s too rigid.”

“We also require a vast number of offensive sword ships and more mountain ferries, with countless divine coins poured in.”

“Additionally, many of the strategies and plans are not related to you. There’s no need to elaborate; you will all learn about them in due course.”

In the Great Li emperor’s study, silence reigned.

Cui Zhan pointed to the southern and western ends of the Baopin Continent map, one being Tongye Continent and the other the central divine continent.

Cui Zhan’s expression turned cold, “In a vast world, it is laughable that the smallest Baopin Continent must step in to help delay the demonic army. I wish to see the seven continents of the vast world die laughing.”

Finally, Cui Zhan spoke solemnly, “If the great Tongye Continent cannot withstand the demonic army, leading to its imminent downfall, then let our little Baopin Continent take it upon itself to make this happen. Everyone, the tides of fortune are shifting; those wishing to resist the heavens, please rise.”

The young emperor was the first to stand.

Everyone present rose to their feet.

At this moment, a figure entered the study, looking somewhat out of place as a cultivator, smiling, “I’m surnamed Fan, though I’m not from the Fan family of Old Dragon City. I hail from the central divine continent, with a little wealth to spare, and I am willing to use divine coins as a pillar to offer my humble assistance to Baopin Continent.”

Outside the study, a strange-looking old eunuch in a bright red robe stood in the corridor, casting a sidelong glance at the white-clad youth squatting against the wall.

The white-clad youth yelled, “I’ve been hustling and bustling all this way, working myself to the bone. After standing here for half a day, I can’t even take a break? Am I here to urinate or defecate? Who are you to care if I squat or stand? You wanna try me? I’ll give you a taste of the Monkey Picking Peaches, fishing for the moon in the sea, trust me, do you fear it?”

Heaven and earth were separated, and no one outside knew of the words exchanged. Inside, Cui Zhan still lightly admonished, “Cui Dongshan!”

The white-clad youth with a mole on his forehead swayed his sleeves, not striding into the emperor’s study but merely walking in, leaving behind a sentence: “I have good news—the Sword Qi Great Wall can hold out an extra two to three years than expected.”

Cui Dongshan ascended the imitation White Jade Capital, climbing to the rooftop.

On the rooftop, Cui Dongshan gazed at the sky through the windows, feeling nostalgic for the times he spent locked away in the attic, reading books as a child.

Never would he have thought that now, still a youthful lad, he was also a white-haired elder.

To hell with the carefree youth who knows not the taste of sorrow, and to hell with the old crane’s call, all clangor and no substance.

A sprout that does not bloom is a cause for mourning since ancient times.

One continent like this, and several continents like this; the mountain dwellers and the world at large were all like this.

Cui Dongshan slapped his face. “At this time and place, I should cry.”

Rubbing his cheeks, he opened his mouth wide and howled, “I can be fierce!”

Leaving the Great Li capital, along the official road, passersby cast curious glances.

A thin, pitiful child was carrying a white-clad youth on his back, stuttering along the way, while the youth was grinning ear to ear.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 754: Zhu Lian Has Questions to Ask (Part 1)

Pei Qian arrived at Red Candle Town and was somewhat puzzled. How dare that little rice grain not show up? Instead, she was up in the mountains, snacking away like she had no conscience at all! Upon reaching Lupo Mountain, Pei Qian was determined to take Zhou Mi Li to the Patriarch Hall for a punishment stand. After that, they would clean the courtyard together.

However, it didn’t take long for Pei Qian to sense that something was amiss. In the distance, there was a commotion in the streets, with people discussing something animatedly. With her keen ears, she rushed over. Upon hearing the gossip, she tightened her grip on her walking stick.

Still stubbornly holding back, she didn’t rush off immediately, instead listening for a while longer. Finally, she sprang lightly onto the rooftops, looking around. Following the general direction indicated by passersby, she darted across the rooftops, fleeting as a dragonfly skimming the water.

On the outskirts of Red Candle Town, there was a crescent-shaped bay where delicate pleasure boats drifted, exuding an overwhelming scent of perfume. It was home to several unfortunate boat girls.

Pei Qian had stepped onto a pleasure boat about four or five times. Each time, the boat would dip slightly before suddenly rising again, but it didn’t rock too much.

As she crossed the bay, she pressed onward, spotting a little girl in black who had left the water’s edge and was heading up the mountain alone.

At this point, she didn’t care about whether she might attract the attention of any cultivators or mountain spirits. She needed to see the little rice grain first to feel at ease.

The carefree little girl in black swayed as she hummed a tune while walking through the forest.

Pei Qian landed lightly on a branch and didn’t reveal herself right away. She scanned her surroundings, frowned slightly, and pretended to be unaware of the situation. After gauging the area, she concluded that there shouldn’t be too much trouble. After all, the little spirit hiding over eighty feet away was far less capable than the water deity of the river.

Pei Qian was initially anxious and angry, but when she noticed that Zhou Mi Li was happily wandering around, casually grabbing a handful of green leaves and stuffing them into her mouth, she felt her irritation grow. Before chewing the leaves, the little girl glanced around to make sure no one was watching, and then took a big bite.

Pei Qian’s initial worry dissipated, but she became even more annoyed.

From the previous discussions she had overheard, the situation was indeed serious. According to passersby, Mi Li had been wandering around the vicinity of Red Candle Town for quite some time, and today, while lying by the riverbank, she was spotted by some spirit servants of the Water Goddess of the Jade Liquid River. Mistaking her for a little spirit not registered in their records, they attempted to recruit her to work in the river’s service. When Zhou Mi Li refused, things escalated into a conflict, and the water deity’s side seemed to have invoked some laws from the Da Li Mountain, causing quite a stir. Zhou Mi Li was frightened and ended up getting beaten.

Pei Qian had more insight into the matter. According to Mountain Lord Wei Ban, Mi Li hailed from the Mute Lake in the North Ju Lu Continent, and her roots were tied to a different water spirit identity. This made her somewhat incompatible with the waters of Da Li’s Three Rivers. Thankfully, she had now obtained the status of a devotee of Lupo Mountain, which mitigated the effect. With more exposure to the various water spirits, she could integrate better into local customs. That was why Pei Qian often took Mi Li out from Lupo Mountain to play around Red Candle Town and Qi Dune Mountain, without getting too close to the Three Rivers. She felt that if they took it slow, and if Mi Li came alone to the banks of the Dan, Embroidery, and Jade Liquid Rivers in the future, it would be fine.

Pei Qian adjusted the small bamboo box on her back, sighed, and called out, “Zhou Mi Li!”

The little girl in black turned around, saw Pei Qian falling from the tree, and broke into a wide smile. She scratched her cheek, then tilted her head slightly to show Pei Qian her unbruised side.

Pei Qian had sharp eyes and immediately noticed the bruise on the other cheek. Well, it seemed that walking home so slowly and munching on leaves was actually a cover-up for the fact that she had been beaten up!

Pei Qian stayed silent.

Zhou Mi Li blinked her eyes.

The little girl tightly clenched her fists, then began to scratch her head.

Her faintly yellowed eyebrows furrowed delicately, and she didn’t dare to frown too hard, fearing Pei Qian might think she was greatly wronged.

Back when they were wandering around in the North Ju Lu Continent, someone had once said that every little worry from childhood was like a small rice grain. When one grew old and looked back, it would amount to a big bowl full!

Pei Qian asked, “What happened?”

Zhou Mi Li thought for a moment, “I was playing by the river, poking my head underwater to see if there were any fish or shrimp. I didn’t dare to eat anything, just wanted a peek. Then I encountered a high-ranking official from the Jade Liquid River’s Water Goddess palace. I explained for quite a while before they believed I lived in a small town in Huai Huang County. I didn’t mention Lupo Mountain or Mud Bottle Alley, just made up some random name for a nearby alley where I raised chickens and ducks. That official believed me and let me go home…”

Pei Qian exclaimed angrily, “Zhou Mi Li! Why didn’t you report my master’s name when they bullied you? Your home is Lupo Mountain; you are the Right Protector of Lupo Mountain!”

The little girl in black timidly replied, “I was afraid of causing trouble. It wasn’t a big deal, just a little rice grain.”

Now that Pei Qian had grown a bit taller, Mi Li felt a little shorter in comparison.

Zhou Mi Li opened her hand, revealing just a handful of sunflower seeds. Earlier, she had brought a large bag, and now only this much remained. The little girl said softly, “Pei Qian, shall we go home? We can eat seeds while we hurry back.”

Pei Qian shot her a glare.

Zhou Mi Li frowned, looking like she was about to cry.

Pei Qian had been away from home for so long that it was hard to finally return, only to be reprimanded right away. This made the little girl feel genuinely wronged.

She had wandered around Qi Dune Mountain and Red Candle Town so many times just to wait for Pei Qian to come home, hoping to see her first and have some sunflower seeds to munch on.

Pei Qian gently ruffled the top of Mi Li’s head and said softly, “Don’t cry, don’t cry.”

Then Pei Qian urged Zhou Mi Li to recount the events in more detail.

The little girl, who usually had a carefree demeanor, finally managed to piece the story together.

Pei Qian then commanded, “Zhou Mi Li, listen up!”

Zhou Mi Li immediately straightened her back and stood on her tiptoes.

Pei Qian waved her hand, “You go home first, hurry up, no dawdling, and don’t wander around. Once home, if the old chef is there and if Wei Mountain Lord is on our mountain, you privately tell the old chef that I’m in Red Candle Town buying some things before returning home. With the New Year coming, I need to prepare some goods. If I come back late, it’ll be because I have too much stuff. You tell the old chef to lend a hand.”

Zhou Mi Li squatted down, “I’m not stupid; I’m not following orders today. I want to go back together.”

Pei Qian said, “On Lupo Mountain, who has a higher rank? Who recommended you to be the Right Protector? Zhou Mi Li!”

The little girl in black squatted on the ground, pretending to be foolish, poking at the dirt and dead leaves.

Pei Qian crouched down and asked, “I have my master’s orders; what is there to be afraid of?”

Zhou Mi Li looked up, “What?”

Pei Qian pulled out a bundle of golden silk thread from her sleeve, “See this?”

Zhou Mi Li gaped, covering her mouth with both hands, mumbling, “Looks impressive and valuable.”

Pei Qian stood up, “Hurry back to Lupo Mountain and tell the old chef what happened. This is called relaying military orders; it’s a heavy responsibility. Can you handle it? Do you have that sense of duty?”

Zhou Mi Li immediately stood up, shouting, “Right Protector is ordered! I will leave immediately!”

Pei Qian tucked the golden sword intent away, then took out a treasured talisman she had kept for many years and slapped it onto Zhou Mi Li’s forehead, “With this talisman, demons and monsters will steer clear. Go!”

Zhou Mi Li dashed off, not forgetting to stretch out her hands as she left.

Pei Qian laughed in exasperation, “You can munch on them on your own way back.”

Pei Qian turned around, tightened her grip on her walking stick, took a deep breath, and headed straight for the distant Water Goddess Palace of the Jade Liquid River.

In the world of rivers and lakes, one must uphold righteousness!

Having become a deity of mountains and waters, she should protect the local land and waters.

What kind of ability was it to bully a little rice grain?

The Water Goddess temple was on the opposite bank. After Pei Qian dashed down the mountain, she leaped high, striking the river with a punch, propelling herself upward before leaping across the vast river in one bound.

A young man dressed in black, running a bookstore in Red Candle Town, sat on the roof. Upon witnessing this scene, the young shopkeeper chuckled, “Now, that’s entertaining.”

He was currently the water deity of the Chong Dan River, a colleague of the Embroidery River and Jade Liquid River.

The attributes of the three rivers varied; the Embroidery River was wide and gentle, the Chong Dan River was swift and fierce, while the Jade Liquid River had the shortest course but was unstable, with spiritual energy distributed irregularly. The water palace of the Jade Liquid River was the most vibrant, and the water goddess was famously adept at "human relations," maintaining good connections with various parties.

The shrine of the Water Goddess was bustling with activity.

Before Pei Qian could enter and reason things out, an elderly priestess and a middle-aged official from the water palace, who had clumsily attempted to conceal their presence, stepped out.

The old priestess had just received news from a diligent spirit who had been tracking the little girl. In a panic, she rushed back to inform of an extremely troubling revelation. The little girl in black was actually a spirit from Lupo Mountain and seemed to be a protective devotee.

The old priestess didn’t take it seriously; a protective devotee? Not to mention that mysterious Lupo Mountain, even their own water deity’s devotees had to start at the Golden Core level! How could a mountain as prestigious as Lupo Mountain, blessed by Wei Dajun’s guardianship, have such low-level beings?

In the old Li Zhu Cave realm, Lupo Mountain was an enigmatic presence shrouded in fog. The young mountain lord, Chen Ping An, was said to have once been a poor orphan from Mud Bottle Alley, but his fortunes changed drastically. He first met the beloved daughter of the saint Ruan Qiong and later encountered Wei Ban during a time of hardship. With these two great benefactors, he eventually came to possess several important feng shui sites.

However, that little girl indeed seemed to possess the registry from Lupo Mountain.

Outsiders only hazily knew that Lupo Mountain appeared to not be too concerned about the classification of spirits, warriors, or cultivators.

With Wei Dajun protecting Lupo Mountain, who would dare be foolish enough to investigate? There were only five mountain lords across the continent, and Wei Ban was the sole upper-level deity of the Baoping Continent!

The emperor himself was quite close to him, and not only was Da Li’s Song clan the land of dragon rise, but the entire old Da Li territory also fell under the jurisdiction of the northern mountain area!

The official from the water palace clasped his hands and bowed, saying, “I misjudged that little girl earlier, mistaking her for a mountain spirit that had wandered into the streets. Considering my duties, I questioned her, and a dispute arose. It was indeed my rudeness, and I wish to apologize to Lupo Mountain.”

The old priestess smiled and replied, “Simply apologizing won’t suffice. We at the Jade Liquid River Water Shrine will make further amends; I’ll personally bring gifts when I visit.”

Pei Qian gripped her walking stick tightly, remaining silent.

What to do?

Something felt off, but she couldn’t pinpoint what it was.

If only her master were around.

Even if her master wasn’t here, having her junior brother would be enough.

The old priestess maintained a calm smile, while the official subtly tugged at his mouth. He knew he’d face some punishment, and would have to buy gifts afterward. However, did they really think this little girl would come demanding retribution? Did they think the Jade Liquid River Water Shrine was of such little consequence? What they truly feared was that incredibly lucky young mountain lord, and the power behind him, Ruan Xiu, Wei Ban. Who did this little martial artist think he was? Did he really intend to rely on brute strength, a walking stick, to smash their shrine? It would be amusing to let him do so, but eventually, who would be left to apologize and make amends? 

Pei Qian, with her sharp gaze, noticed something.

Fuming, she took a deep breath.

Her walking stick trembled slightly, and a subtle ripple emerged from her sleeve. Since it wasn’t the kind of spiritual energy that a cultivator would use, even the elderly priestess didn’t notice.

“Apologize to your mother!” 

A figure clad in green, radiating an imposing aura, landed directly in front of the Water Goddess Shrine, standing beside Pei Qian.

It was none other than Chen Lingjun, who had fully refined a Dragon King’s basket.

Without a word, Chen Lingjun raised the Dragon King’s basket, which had been meticulously repaired by the true dragon of the North Ju Lu Continent, and it suddenly grew large as a mountain, enveloping the entire Water Goddess Shrine.

In the world, the Dragon King’s basket could capture even the most unruly of dragons. Chen Lingjun’s presence alone put immense pressure on the old priestess and the official from the water palace, both of whom were of water spirit heritage. The old priestess could still manage to hold her ground, but the official found his knees buckling, nearly collapsing to the ground, only prevented from losing face by the old priestess grabbing him by the shoulder.

Chen Lingjun spoke, “So, you want to apologize, huh? I’ll do you one better: I’ll beat you first, then apologize!”

The old priestess smiled and replied, “If we harm the little girl, that’s a thousand mistakes. But once a mistake is made, to apologize is also not wrong. This immortal master isn’t trying to bully anyone, are you planning to suppress the Water Goddess Shrine today with that magical artifact?”

Chen Lingjun’s expression darkened as he nodded, “Yes, after I smash this dilapidated Water Goddess Shrine, I’ll head straight back to North Ju Lu Continent. Even if my lord wants to scold me, he won’t be able to.”

Pei Qian suddenly interjected, “Chen Lingjun, I’m used to being scolded by my master; let me handle this.”

Chen Lingjun was taken aback.

His lord would never dare to scold this little girl.

Chen Lingjun chuckled, “Pei Qian, your current realm…”

Before he could finish his sentence, Pei Qian brought her walking stick down heavily onto the ground. The golden silk thread, which even Pei Qian couldn’t suppress, instantly unfurled like a waterfall, wrapping around her walking stick.

It resembled a golden longsword.

Pei Qian thrust the stick into the ground.

In that instant, the aura of the sword filled the air.

Even Chen Lingjun, with his extremely resilient physique, couldn’t help but take a few steps back.

The old ancestor of the sword cultivators, Zhou Cheng, had once said that when one felt deep discontent, one must draw the sword.

The old priestess was thrown into a panic, unable to maintain her calm demeanor, realizing how trivial the situation was. The girl with the bamboo box was evidently a sword cultivator.

She might even be the legendary sword genius!

The old priestess had already lost track of the official from the water palace and hurriedly activated her water spirit’s innate divine ability, sending ripples of thought to notify the Water Goddess in the great river’s palace.

However, there was no response.

Because above the water palace, an old man with a hunched back, floating in the air, was looking down into the water with his hands behind his back, smiling as he said, “You’ll die.”

Pei Qian brandished the walking stick entwined with golden sword intent, her eyes shining brightly.

She declared, “I remember what my master said! Apologies must be sincere, not just about the quantity of gifts. This matter is wrong, and the order is wrong. What is sincerity? You’re not merely apologizing to Lupo Mountain; you must apologize to Zhou Mi Li.”

The water deity of the Chong Dan River retracted his hand, looking helpless. They couldn’t just let the Jade Liquid River Water Shrine go down this path, so he rushed over. After a while of enjoying the fun, being overly relaxed could lead to trouble. Eventually, someone would cause a commotion.

Just as he was about to approach the water palace, the old man said, “Bias and twisted reasoning will lead to death as well.”

The black-clad water deity had to land on the surface of the Jade Liquid River.

A gracefully dressed woman emerged from the water, sneering, “Lupo Mountain seeks trouble with the Jade Liquid River; I’ll be reporting you all to the Grand Li Department of Rites.”

Zhu Lian pulled out a Great Li Peace and No Trouble token, the first-class token, and placed it at his waist, nodding and smiling, “Alright. I’ll give you this opportunity. I don’t want your Chong Dan River colleague thinking you’re just posturing.”

Upon seeing the unmistakable first-class token, the water goddess’s expression changed dramatically. Hesitating, she bit her lip, ready to bow her head first before making a decision...

But before she could act, a punch landed squarely on her.

She was directly knocked down to the depths of the Jade Liquid River.

Her golden body trembled, and golden blood flowed from her seven orifices, revealing her identity as a deity of the waters.

The hunchbacked old man, exuding an immense aura of martial intent, found himself landing not far from the water’s bottom, as if using the divine power of a celestial to split the waters.

The old man laughed, “Since Lupo Mountain is in charge, Zhu Lian is here today to ask questions of the Jade Liquid River Water Palace. I have offended greatly.”

As the old man took a step back, he gently stepped out, his hunched frame bending even lower, calmly saying, “I will strike, and only life or death shall decide. No reasoning involved.”

On the distant river surface of the battlefield below, the deity of the Chong Dan River frowned, his expression grave.

That martial arts master below the water was not merely at the distant travel realm.

The old man’s martial intent was so immense that it suddenly pressed down on the current of the Jade Liquid River.

It was an unfathomable sense of superiority!

With one punch, the river shattered.

The old man reached out and grabbed the neck of the palace-dressed woman, who was now bleeding golden blood and sinking into the rushing waters.

The old man glanced at the Chong Dan River deity, who stood up and clasped his fists, saying, “Senior, please feel free to head to the Jade Liquid River Water Shrine.”

The old man laughed, “I’ve had a long-standing relationship with the Water Goddess regarding purchasing and selling books; Lupo Mountain remembers it well. Earlier, I was merely posturing. Water Goddess, please don’t hold a grudge.”

The Chong Dan River deity could only smile bitterly and nod.

At the shrine, the priestess caught a glimpse of the scene from afar, witnessing the old man soaring through the air, holding their severely injured water goddess.

The old priestess’s soul seemed to fly away, and she hurriedly activated her meager divine abilities, casting illusions to conceal the scene and quickly shut the doors of the shrine to prevent the faithful from seeing what had transpired.

Earlier, the Water Goddess Shrine had already been in an uproar; after all, no one was blind. Everyone could see the suspended Dragon King’s basket. The old priestess had intentionally left the door open, merely preventing the devotees from going out, allowing them to crowd at the entrance to watch the commotion.

After Zhu Lian landed, he casually tossed the injured water goddess at the feet of the old priestess, then walked between Pei Qian and Chen Lingjun, extending his hands to pat their heads, smiling, “Very good.”

Pei Qian slapped the old chef’s hand away.

Chen Lingjun tucked away the massive Dragon King’s basket that overshadowed everything.

Zhu Lian stepped forward, placing a foot on the barely conscious water goddess’s head, looking towards the entrance, and smiled at the old priestess, “You, old hag, with a bad heart and an ugly face, why don’t you continue to drag the common folk to share the danger? Are you still hoping to tarnish our Lupo Mountain’s reputation? Useless.”

Zhu Lian pressed down harder, causing the water goddess’s head to sink into the ground.

“Alright, let’s leave it at that. Remember to apologize. Whether you survive or not doesn’t matter; it’ll save a few cups of tea money. However, the deity’s money from the Jade Liquid River must be collected. Our Lupo Mountain is but a small hill, too poor to even scrape by.”

Zhu Lian turned to ask, “Do you prefer it easier, or do you want to leave a way out for future meetings?”

Pei Qian shook her walking stick, puzzled, “What do you mean?”

Zhu Lian smiled, “You’ll understand when your sister Xiu returns.”

Pei Qian responded, “Then we’ll just apologize and be done with it.”

Zhu Lian looked down at the half-dead but still pretending to be dead water goddess and, channeling his voice with intent, smiled at her, “You’re just lucky to run into us at Lupo Mountain. Just enjoy it quietly; otherwise, not just this shrine, but your Jade Liquid River’s existence will be uncertain in the future. The method of salvation has already been imparted to you; think for yourself.”

Zhu Lian then left with Pei Qian and Chen Lingjun, strolling leisurely along the riverbank.

Zhu Lian rubbed his wrist, sighing, “In the end, it wasn’t satisfying enough. If all mountain and water deities had such a disposition, then the methods of Yuan Bao would be the way to go. Luckily, it’s not all like this.”

Pei Qian complained, “Fighting and killing—what’s the propriety in that? Old chef, what did that dim-witted Yuan Bao say? She’s quite tall; why is her mind always muddled?”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “We’ll talk about it when we get home.”

Pei Qian struck Chen Lingjun’s head with her stick, and even though it was just a trace of sword intent left behind, it nearly knocked him to the ground, causing him to tremble.

Chen Lingjun, swaying like a pendulum, finally hugged his head and shouted, “Pei Qian, what’s that for?”

Pei Qian paused, quickly apologizing, saying her walking stick had been acting weird today. Seeing that Chen Lingjun wasn’t angry, she felt relieved! Pei Qian then laughed heartily, “Chen Lingjun, you did a great job today. I’ll erase all seventy-two accounts of you stealing sunflower seeds from my little ledger!”

Seventy-two entries… just for munching on sunflower seeds.

Chen Lingjun grinned through the pain, “Thank you.”

Pei Qian bounced up, “Let’s go find Mi Li and munch on seeds!”

Zhu Lian reminded, “Pei Qian, don’t forget.”

Pei Qian brandished the insane sword technique, occasionally scaring Chen Lingjun, “Don’t worry; I’ll remind Mi Li.”

Chen Lingjun said, “Old chef, I plan to go to North Ju Lu Continent.”

Zhu Lian nodded, “The sooner you go and return, the better.”

Ruan Qiong had returned to the Longquan Sword Sect from the Da Li capital, still focused on sword forging.

The discussions held in the Imperial Study had all been sworn into a pact; anyone who leaked the details would face retribution, and the Da Li court would punish their entire family.

Ruan Qiong was indifferent to these matters, for he and the Da Li court were allies.

Affairs of the Longquan Sword Sect were entirely left to disciples like Dong Gu and Xu Xiaoqiao, who were the trusted ones. Ruan Xiu had spent several years cultivating at Dragon Spine Mountain and had quietly descended the mountain to travel north to the new territory of the Longquan Sword Sect. Fortunately, there were no conflicts, and she managed to negotiate peacefully with the old Middle Mount deity, which greatly relieved Ruan Qiong.

With the territory established but no one managing it, this was the most awkward aspect of the Longquan Sword Sect.

For a sect of its stature, the number of direct disciples in the Patriarch Hall was too few.

Even though they had gradually accepted three groups of disciples, each group was small, making it seem as if the sect’s vitality was waning.

Thus, the Da Li Song clan handed over the old Zhu Ying dynasty territory to Zhengyang Mountain. Ruan Qiong didn’t feel any resentment; if one’s ability was insufficient to hold onto the meat, it would naturally fall into someone else’s bowl. Therefore, he had to content himself with the pickled vegetables in his own bowl.

Moreover, the Da Li court had previously allocated a large chunk of territory to the Longquan Sword Sect, laying the groundwork.

The proximity to the capital was a gesture from the young emperor to prevent court officials from suspecting that the Longquan Sword Sect had fallen to the sidelines, and that Zhengyang Mountain would become the future first sect of the Baoping Continent.

Of course, it also diminished the suspicion of crossing the river and tearing down the bridge.

The Da Li court had treated Ruan Qiong very well since the previous emperor and the current one, from the time Ruan Qiong was stationed at Li Zhu Cave until now.

It was mainly Ruan Qiong’s unwillingness to accept disciples indiscriminately; those lacking in temperament, no matter how talented they were as innate sword seedlings, had other places to go, and it didn’t matter if they went to Zhengyang Mountain, which was likely to become the next sword sect.

Of the twelve named disciples, half had left, including one innate sword seedling, who had now gone to Zhengyang Mountain and was already a direct disciple of that sect’s Patriarch.

Of course, Ruan Qiong’s good relationships had truly opened the eyes of the young emperor, Song He.

Before the discussions in the Imperial Study, various mountain lords, including Qi Zhen of the Divine Decree Sect, the old ancestor of the Wind and Snow Temple, the Law Sword cultivator of Zhenwu Mountain, and Liu Lao Cheng of Zhenjing Sect, along with Wei Ban and Jin Qing, had all engaged in friendly conversation with Ruan Qiong. They had all taken the initiative to approach him, at least greeting him properly and treating him with the utmost courtesy.

No one else compared.

Though Ruan Qiong was not a good speaker, the nature of a cultivator’s character was difficult to conceal over time.

Those who knew Ruan Qiong found no flaws in him and preferred to foster friendships. Those who didn’t know him, if they casually mentioned Ruan Qiong, whether it was the past Ruan Qiong of the Wind and Snow Temple or the current sect master, would still speak highly of the number one swordsmith of the Baoping Continent.

Today, Ruan Qiong rarely made an appearance and called all his first-generation disciples to dine together.

The first disciple listed in the genealogy of the Longquan Sword Sect, Dong Gu, had long since entered the Golden Core level and had opened his peak. However, the most awkward part for Dong Gu was that he was not a sword cultivator, and his background was difficult to speak of. Now, whispers had begun to circulate among the Da Li court and various celestial mountain sects.

Xu Xiaoqiao was once a sword cultivator of the Wind and Snow Temple, but after committing a grave mistake and being expelled from the sect, he found Ruan Qiong. He cut off the thumb of his right hand, which wielded the sword, to become Ruan Qiong’s direct disciple.

Xie Ling had already nurtured a flying sword of his own. Besides that, the celestial weapon gifted by Lu Chen, the old ancestor Xie Shi, had also been gifted to this descendant of Taoye Alley, along with two treasured items: one was a relic of a Baoping Continent sword cultivator named “Peach Leaf,” which Xie Ling refined into one of his vital treasures, and another was a high-ranking nurturing sword gourd named “Full Moon.”

The four master and disciple sat on separate benches.

Ruan Xiu was still in the old Middle Mount territory, so Ruan Qiong had no chance to serve food to anyone.

Even though his daughter wasn’t present, just the thought of that scoundrel not being in Lupo Mountain made Ruan Qiong feel somewhat better.

Ruan Qiong said, “Dong Gu, you mentioned before that you aim to reach the Nascent Soul stage within a hundred years?”

Dong Gu quickly put down his utensils and wiped his mouth, solemnly saying, “Yes, Master.”

Ruan Qiong instructed, “Then don’t let others’ progress affect your state of mind, forcing yourself to advance to the Nascent Soul stage ahead of time. Cultivation and understanding the Dao are solely dependent on your efforts. Being in the Longquan Sword Sect, so what if you’re not a sword cultivator? So what if outsiders gossip and laugh? Even if you are eventually surpassed by Xu Xiaoqiao and Xie Ling in realm, so what? You will still be the founding disciple of the Longquan Sword Sect! When did the Longquan Sword Sect ever need to rely on fists to determine seniority? Have I not taught you this? Or have you forgotten?”

Ruan Qiong glanced at Dong Gu, “Continue eating.”

Dong Gu immediately picked up his chopsticks.

Ruan Qiong then turned to Xu Xiaoqiao and Xie Ling, “After you finish your meal, go to the old Middle Mount territory. If Xiu Xiu doesn’t want to come back, there’s no use in trying to persuade her.”

Xu Xiaoqiao nodded.

Ruan Qiong suddenly said, “Remember to stop by the Qilong Alley New Year’s shop and buy some pastries.”

Xu Xiaoqiao, usually quiet, rarely showed a smile.

Xie Ling was even more unable to hide his happiness, finally getting to see Sister Xiu.

The two direct sword cultivators of the Longquan Sword Sect took to their swords and headed toward the new territory of the Longquan Sword Sect.

Above the sea of clouds, Xie Ling asked with a smile, “Second Sister, I heard that Sister Xiu has a little spirit companion with her?”

Xu Xiaoqiao responded with an “Mm.”

Xie Ling didn’t ask more.

In the thick snow-covered mountain fields, as the two were descending the mountain, a little girl holding an oil-paper umbrella suddenly pounced out, rolling around in the snow, completely covered in white, tumbling down the slope.

The young woman followed slowly behind.

Once the little girl got up, she wielded the oil-paper umbrella like a hammer, chanting, “Old Lord swings his hammer, the comet adds charcoal dust, oh no, oh no! The Rain Master and Wind Lord are helping, and the Thunder Lord and Lightning Mother are coming to assist, bang bang bang!”

The young woman remarked, “The sword forging chant isn’t recited like that.”

The little girl paused her hammering motion, looked up at the distant mountains, and asked in a lowered voice, “Sister Xiu, is that the mountain deity? The former mountain lord of our Da Li Dynasty! Even a fart sounds like thunder and could blow me away. Why is it still so polite to you? It doesn’t seem polite; it’s more like fear of Sister Xiu.”

Ruan Xiu said, “You’re so clever, knowing the answer, why ask? Talking more makes you hungry.”

The little girl’s eyes twinkled, “Sister Xiu, doesn’t that mean you’re even smarter than me?”

Ruan Xiu shook her head, “I don’t like to think; I’m rather dull.”

The little girl pretended to be scared, “Sister Xiu, if you get too hungry and eat me, I’ll be in trouble!”

Ruan Xiu nodded, “I will.”

The little girl scampered over to Ruan Xiu’s side, genuinely frightened now, tugging at her sleeve, whispering, “Sister Xiu, don’t eat me.”

Ruan Xiu wasn’t very inclined to talk.

The little girl held her beloved umbrella, “Sister Xiu, be careful, or I’ll tell on you…”

In response, the little girl received a gentle slap from Ruan Xiu, spinning her around several times before landing heavily in the thick snow, rolling away and breaking countless dry branches.

However, the little girl quickly dashed back to Ruan Xiu’s side as if nothing had happened, clearly used to it.

As they approached the foot of the mountain, the little girl quickly hid behind Ruan Xiu.

Xu Xiaoqiao and Xie Ling gracefully landed, sheathing their swords. The way they sheathed their swords was distinctly different—one was neat and efficient, while the other was flowing and artistic.

One respectfully called out “Elder Sister,” while the other playfully called “Sister Xiu.”

Ruan Xiu nodded slightly, simply saying, “You’re here.”

The little girl peeked out from behind Ruan Xiu, puzzled. How strange! Two sword immortals had arrived; they didn’t look like a pair of divine lovers. That boy with an awkward expression was clearly infatuated with Sister Xiu.

Didn’t he just call her Sister Xiu?

Tsk tsk tsk.

The little girl thought this young sword immortal was quite pathetic.

She really wanted to knock that boy out, drag him back to her cave as her future husband, and raise him properly. As for the so-called cave, it would only be hers.

Ruan Xiu cautiously took out a piece of peach blossom cake and placed it in her mouth, instantly beaming with joy.

She then pinched a piece and offered it to the little girl. The little girl swallowed it in one bite, the taste unknown.

Ruan Xiu asked, “Did you pay?”

Xu Xiaoqiao replied, “I already did.”

Ruan Xiu nodded but said, “I don’t need to pay when I go there.”

Xu Xiaoqiao fell silent.

Xie Ling felt a complex mix of emotions.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 755: Zhu Lian Has Questions to Ask (Part 2)**

Xu Xiaoqiao said, “Master asked me to ask Senior Sister whether we should head back.” 

Ruan Xiu replied, “Of course we should go back! I want to hear Xiaomi Li tell stories. It’s been so long since we last met, and I’m sure Xiaomi Li can come up with plenty of new tales.” 

Xu Xiaoqiao thought that Ruan Xiu’s reasoning was entirely justified.

In a small bookshop located in an old city of a vassal state from the Zhurong Dynasty, the shopkeeper was a young woman named He Jia. Although she was of average beauty, her figure was exquisite enough to attract many roguish youths who often lingered around the shop. However, none of them managed to take advantage of her; at most, they would engage in some flirtatious banter, to which the young woman paid little mind. There were also well-off but not particularly notable young scholars who visited to buy books, their intentions not solely aimed at literature.

This evening, He Jia sat behind the counter, flipping through a book. As she glanced at the darkening sky, she decided to close the shop and head back to her residence, which was only two alleys away.

Just as she set down her book, she noticed a young man standing outside the shop with a sword on his back. Though he appeared somewhat disheveled, his handsome features were hard to ignore—like a jade tree standing in the wind, his beauty shone brightly.

“Excuse me, young sir,” she said softly, “I’m sorry, but the shop is about to close.”

He remained on the threshold, seemingly hesitant to step inside. His lips trembled slightly as he tried to calm his voice, “I just happened to pass by and wanted to buy a few books. I didn’t mean to seek you out.”

He Jia sighed inwardly. Such a clumsy excuse—did he think anyone would believe it?

However, she chose not to press further. Sitting back down, she picked up her book and said gently, “If you truly want to buy books, feel free to choose for yourself. I can keep the shop open a little longer.”

The young man still didn’t step over the threshold.

He Jia continued to read, the fading sunlight casting a warm glow over her. Although her current circumstances were far from glorious, she was not an ordinary person and didn’t feel particularly troubled.

Gathering his courage, he spoke with a shaky voice, “Will you come with me to Fenglei Garden? Please, Su Jia?”

Even without any tricks to disguise herself, even if she had transformed into someone entirely different, Liu Baqiao would still recognize her at a glance. No matter how time flowed, whether she became a young girl or an old woman with white hair, he would never miss her in a crowd.

But how could he voice these thoughts? On what grounds could he say such things?

He Jia lifted her head, frowning slightly. “Although I’m no longer a direct disciple of the Patriarch Hall, my name is still clearly listed on the outer sect roster of Zhengyang Mountain. Why would you say such things, Liu Gongzi?”

She paused for a moment before continuing, “But now, I consider this a journey of experience. So please, don’t call me Su Jia anymore.”

Liu Baqiao felt a tightening in his chest. Even as a promising sword cultivator at the Golden Elixir stage, he felt breathless at this moment, as if he wanted to bend over to catch his breath.

“What do you go by now?” he asked.

He Jia responded with a hint of annoyance, “Liu Gongzi, does it have anything to do with you?!”

Liu Baqiao lowered his head and muttered softly, “I like you. I’ve been looking for you for many years.”

The bookshop’s proprietress, He Jia—or rather, Su Jia of Zhengyang Mountain—stood up and said, “Liu Gongzi, I ask you to leave me a little peace, will you? I’ve invested my last bit of savings to settle here and start a new life. It hasn’t been easy. Liu Gongzi, I am different from you now. I never liked you, and you should reflect on that. How many times have we met? How many words have we exchanged?”

Liu Baqiao looked up, offering a sad smile. “We never spoke before. Today is the first time.”

Su Jia softened her tone. “Liu Gongzi, you should know that I don’t have feelings for you, right?”

Liu Baqiao nodded.

Su Jia chuckled helplessly, “You like Su Jia, the talented sword cultivator of Fenglei Garden, so should Su Jia be grateful to you?”

Liu Baqiao shook his head. “That’s not how it works. It’s right that you don’t like me.”

Su Jia closed the book and gently placed it on the table. “If you feel guilty because my senior brother bested me in a duel years ago, let me sincerely tell you that there’s no need for that. I bear no grudge against your senior brother Huang He. On the contrary, I understand that he far surpasses me in both swordsmanship and cultivation. Losing is just losing. Furthermore, if you think I resent Zhengyang Mountain for being expelled after my defeat, then you have misunderstood me even more.”

Su Jia’s eyes were clear. “I have been cultivating on the mountain since childhood and have no memories of the world below. So from the moment I could remember, I have regarded Zhengyang Mountain as my only home.”

Liu Baqiao spoke softly, “As long as Su Jia continues to run this shop, I will leave, and I promise to never disturb you again.”

Su Jia was both frustrated and amused. “I’ve already told you, opening this bookstore and buying a small house have exhausted my savings. Even if I wanted to move, where could I go? I just hope you keep your promise.”

Liu Baqiao nodded. “I will.”

In the end, Liu Baqiao still didn’t step across the threshold, only asking, “May I sit here for a while? Just a little while.”

Su Jia had no choice but to agree.

And so, Liu Baqiao sat right there on the threshold.

As the sunset cast longer shadows across the street, Liu Baqiao finally stood up and left.

He Zhi Xiu was indeed Su Jia, and many admired such a woman.

What was wrong with liking her?

Inside the bookshop, Su Jia shook her head, wishing this strange situation would come to an end. The fact that Liu Baqiao liked her had long been an open secret between Zhengyang Mountain and Fenglei Garden, but Su Jia genuinely didn’t return his feelings.

She locked up the shop and headed to her small residence.

After that duel years ago, Su Jia lost everything—a sword peak, her status as a direct disciple of the Patriarch Hall, and the treasured sword nurturing gourd gifted by her master.

Now, she was left with nothing but mud on her feet, forced to hide in the common streets.

Before this, she had faced hardships, but she had managed to cope with all the troubles, and now she was moving forward.

As for Zhengyang Mountain, as she had said, she held no resentment—only an unshakeable guilt.

What was difficult to let go were certain people and certain words.

But regarding Huang He, the door disciple of Li Tun Jing and now the master of Fenglei Garden, Su Jia felt an indescribable fear that often jolted her awake from nightmares.

She couldn’t comprehend it, nor could she let it go.

Back then, on the snowy temple’s divine platform where the three sword duels were held, the man with the sword case, filled with small swords but not his own flying sword, distractedly wielding them, was beyond reason.

One sword pierced the hand that wielded her sword, another severed the red cord that connected the nourishing sword gourd at her waist, and finally, two flying swords pinned her wrists.

After Su Jia fainted, the last scene she saw before closing her eyes was Huang He stepping on her nourishing sword gourd, twisting it gently.

That mountain-like man, seemingly powerful and invincible, was cold and merciless in every regard.

Even today, upon seeing Liu Baqiao, Su Jia trembled at the thought of Huang He and that nightmare, the true source of her anguish.

Walking through the secluded alley, Su Jia wrapped her arms around her shoulders, as if seeking warmth.

As she walked, her face turned pale. Leaning against the wall, she raised a hand to rub her temples.

After a long time, Su Jia wiped the sweat from her forehead and made her way to her small house.

When she reached the end of an alley and opened the door, she froze in place, tears streaming down her face.

The woman before her resembled her, but just as Liu Baqiao recognized Su Jia in an instant, Su Jia recognized the woman standing in front of her.

It was her master, the one who had taken her up the mountain to cultivate.

However, for some reason, the records of the Patriarch Hall did not reflect this; Su Jia had long ago joined the ranks of an elder of Zhengyang Mountain and subsequently became a direct disciple of the Patriarch Hall.

Yet her master remained unrecorded, despite her high status—she had simply never made a name for herself on Zhengyang Mountain.

Every time the Patriarch Hall convened, her master almost never appeared, and the chair at the back, which she occupied, always sat empty. She preferred to wander the world, often gone for decades at a time.

The woman revealed her true form, the Zhengyang Mountain female cultivator who had attended meetings at the Great Li Imperial Study, sitting in a position where no one bothered to acknowledge her.

Young in appearance, she was not particularly beautiful.

She walked to Su Jia, who was teary-eyed, and reached out to gently touch her head, smiling softly, “Silly disciple. Master merely left Zhengyang Mountain for a few years to travel. Why have you become such a timid girl? Did you forget how to walk in the dark? I should have known not to send you to Yuhu Peak back then.”

Su Jia smiled, her eyes sparkling like autumn water, as if with her master by her side, she could truly fear nothing, returning to the carefree girl she once was.

The woman withdrew her hand, noticing the red string tied around her wrist.

After a brief moment, she stood up to leave.

She didn’t mention bringing Su Jia back to Zhengyang Mountain or restoring her status as a direct disciple of the Patriarch Hall, nor did she bring up the future of the nourishing sword gourd.

Yet Su Jia felt that her current, simple life was not as hard as she had imagined. Although there were many regrets in her heart, simply guarding the bookshop and earning a bit of silver and copper coins brought her peace of mind, except for that haunting nightmare.

After the woman left, she transformed back into an ordinary woman dressed plainly.

Not long after she departed, there was a knock on the door.

Su Jia rushed to open it, mistakenly believing it was her master returning, only to stumble back, swaying unsteadily.

With her sword heart destroyed and her cultivation fallen to the lower ranks, Su Jia felt less than an ordinary woman at this moment.

The man standing outside had a cold expression as he spoke slowly, “Su Jia, you should know that Liu Baqiao will definitely sneak over to see you later, just so you won't notice. Now you have two choices: either crawl back to Zhengyang Mountain and cling to life, or find a man to marry and settle down. If Liu Baqiao still harbors feelings for you, causing delays in your sword training, I will ensure he gives up entirely.”

Su Jia bit her lip, blood seeping from it, unable to utter a word.

The speaker was none other than Huang He, the master of Fenglei Garden, who had broken through at an unknown time.

If it weren’t for the sword immortal Wei Jin from the Snow Temple, Huang He would undoubtedly be regarded as the number one sword genius in Baoping Continent today.

After saying this, Huang He took flight on his sword and departed.

If Liu Baqiao weren’t someone highly valued by her master, Huang He wouldn’t even bother with such trivial matters of love.

If Fenglei Garden didn’t require someone to bear the burden in case of his unexpected absence, Huang He wouldn’t have felt the need to concern himself with Liu Baqiao at all.

Both were sword cultivators, yet the gap between their paths was vast.

After successfully exiting his latest closed-door retreat, Huang He awaited a duel with a certain elder sword cultivator from Zhengyang Mountain.

Following Liu Baqiao to this place, Huang He had resisted the urge to strike several times, almost wanting to knock Liu Baqiao unconscious and drag him back to Fenglei Garden, forcing the talent-wasting young man to spend a hundred years in seclusion.

Su Jia, lost in thought, shut the door behind her, leaning against it and collapsing to the ground in tears.

What would she do about Huang He, whose shadow lingered on?

Her master, that woman, had just stepped outside the city gate, looking up at the sky before continuing her journey—not towards Zhengyang Mountain, but in search of her next disciple.

As for Fenglei Garden, it would stagnate for hundreds of years from now on.

Brotherhood had turned into deadly enmity.

Whether it was Huang He remaining or Liu Baqiao, all that was left was the next Li Tun Jing.

What made this interesting was not that Su Jia didn’t like Liu Baqiao—she wouldn’t like him in the future either—but that she herself didn’t realize that she had already developed feelings for Huang He.

If both Liu Baqiao and Huang He were to end up half-dead, that would be even better.

As for the Zhengyang Mountain woman killed by Li Tun Jing hundreds of years ago, she was, in fact, a disciple of the woman who had just walked away, similarly unrecorded.

There were also several women who were not disciples, yet had some connection to her.

Or perhaps she had engaged in some trivial matters unrelated to being a master or disciple.

For instance, how she met and fell for He Xiaolian at the Snow Temple.

In the early years of the Zhurong Dynasty, there were also some old stories of trivial matters.

Unknowingly, the sword path’s fate over the past thousand years had been manipulated by her, though she wouldn’t dare claim it all—at least half of it was indeed in her hands.

Beyond that, she had once been to Tongye Continent, leaving behind a prophecy at the Fuyi Sect.

She shook her sleeves, slightly raised her wrist, looked down with a smile, retracted her gaze, and walked forward slowly.

Many so-called wise men at the mountain tops excel at weaving intricate plots, but such plots are ultimately fragile and easily broken.

Yet there is one thread in the world, once it is made, even sword immortals find it hard to sever. Even if it appears to be cut, it remains a connection that can entangle for a lifetime.

Unless there is someone truly skilled in deep calculations and adept at unraveling intricacies, there might be hope to confront this deadlock and feel a bit better.

Once the thread is pulled, it’s not that sword immortals cannot kill, but often it leads to a fate worse than death, and then death itself seems like a relief.

She never underestimated her enemies.

Thus, for those she cared about, she had to bury more threads.

The world is filled with infatuated souls, fond of sorrowful tales, finding joy in suffering, reveling in it. How could one be considered infatuated without heartache?

Her thoughts wandered.

It was a pity she hadn’t seen her senior brother in so many years.

The last time was actually very close, as if they had brushed past each other. But as long as her senior brother wanted to avoid her, she thought she would be blind even if they were close enough to touch.

She had heard that he was last seen near the Daoist temple in Tongye Continent.

Her senior brother had one flaw—he liked to borrow the red thread from her wrist but never returned it.

Suddenly, the woman scoffed at herself, “Could it be that I’ve already been noticed?”

Shaking her head, she smiled, “Absolutely not. I’m still quite young. Why should I care about a little Zhengyang Mountain?”

A scruffy young man, hunched and wearing ragged clothes, first went to the tavern in the small town for a drink and some banter, then wandered over to the street where Yang’s shop was located.

He was both a shop assistant and a disciple of the old man Yang, sitting behind the counter with a sleepy expression, lost in thought.

Today, the diligent Su Dian wasn’t practicing her peculiar boxing technique; instead, she was sitting at the door soaking up the sun when she noticed her senior brother Zheng Dafu approaching. Su Dian stood up, and Zheng Dafu waved, “Su girl, you look even prettier than before. If you keep getting more charming, it’ll make me anxious thinking about how you’ll eventually marry off.”

As he got closer to Su Dian, Zheng Dafu slapped his chest dramatically, feigning heartbreak.

Su Dian asked, “Are you looking for Master?”

Zheng Dafu sighed, “Not looking for Master. It’s just so cold on the mountain that no matter how many blankets I use, I can’t get warm. I thought I’d come down and stretch my legs. Su girl, you’re just a few steps away from me. Don’t you ever think of visiting your senior brother? I live in such a big house, and yet I’m here all alone, like a thin willow.”

Su Dian shook her head, “I don’t dare stay there overnight. I’m afraid there might be mice scurrying around the walls.”

Zheng Dafu said earnestly, “Su girl, it’s not that your senior brother is using his status to scold you. As a martial artist, you should have the courage of a hero. How can you be so timid? Come on, let’s go stay at my place tonight and toughen your spirit.”

Su Dian said helplessly, “Senior brother, if there’s something to discuss, please just say it.”

If she hadn’t known this reckless senior brother would only talk and not take action, Su Dian would have fallen out with him long ago.

Zheng Dafu, hands behind his back, spotted a small stool, wanting to sit down, thinking it would be warmer.

But Su Dian kicked it aside, lifting it into her hands.

Zheng Dafu crossed the threshold, saw Shi Ling Shan, and shook his head. “They say the ones closest to the water have the first chance. But you, boy, can’t even keep an eye on your own senior sister. Just wait, soon you’ll be the one to suffer. Which novel doesn’t write about senior sisters or younger sisters walking the world only to be deceived by handsome, wealthy young heroes? Shi Ling Shan, wake up! Your senior sister is getting married!”

Shi Ling Shan was so furious he nearly exploded, glaring at Zheng Dafu. “Zheng Dafu, stop stirring the pot and spreading rumors!”

Zheng Dafu rolled his eyes. “You can’t even curse properly. What good are you?”

Shi Ling Shan was about to retort when his senior sister spoke up, “Senior brother, you said before that if I wanted to break through the fourth realm or reach the fifth realm, I should choose an ancient battlefield as a site. Do you have any suggestions? I want to go out for a while.”

Shi Ling Shan was taken aback.

Zheng Dafu, glancing at him, remarked, “Your senior brother didn’t eat enough before coming down. If he doesn’t go to relieve himself, he won’t get anything.”

Feeling both heartbroken and furious, Shi Ling Shan was almost pushed to spar with Zheng Dafu. But when he saw the other’s hunchbacked figure, he felt a pang of sympathy and decided against it.

Zheng Dafu chuckled and turned to Su Dian, saying, “There are indeed places in mind, but for such important matters, Master has his own plans, so it’s not for me to worry about.”

Su Dian asked, “Do you think I can leave home alone now?”

Zheng Dafu shook his head. “You should take a sidekick with you for safety. You both are still inexperienced, and the world outside is dangerous—not just in terms of cultivation levels but in human hearts. Shi Ling Shan is alright. He’s soft-hearted but can be ruthless when it counts. But you, you’re hard-hearted most of the time, which can lead to trouble. Su girl, when you both go on a journey, you can say Shi Ling Shan is your son. This way, those shameless suitors won’t bother you. Just thinking about it keeps me up at night.”

Su Dian didn’t know how to respond.

Shi Ling Shan was also infuriated, feeling as if a thunderbolt had struck him.

Zheng Dafu glanced toward the bamboo curtain and then turned to leave Yang’s shop.

Zheng Dafu went to the dilapidated archway where the four plaques had lost their mystique. He wandered around, and though the plaques remained, their significance was lost.

He then went to the iron-locked well, which had become a private forbidden area atop a certain mountain. It had been bought for a hefty price years ago, yet yielded no benefits. How foolish could one be?

Remembering the Jiang family from Yunlin, Zheng Dafu gritted his teeth, checked his surroundings, and discreetly adjusted his pants. “I’m sorry, big brother. You’ve worked hard studying, learning all those skills, only to realize you have no thieves to catch.”

Zheng Dafu left the small town and headed toward the Immortal Graveyard, now devoid of that name. The Great Li had deliberately downplayed this old saying; even the dilapidated divine statues were being propped back up, restored to their former glory. 

The Great Li court had put in effort to rejuvenate the place, but as for the large new martial temple, he didn’t bother visiting—it was pointless, a waste of time.

He took a detour to the waterfall where the Iron Talismans River met the Dragon Whisker River, squatting there to toss stones.

What a sight, as Yang Ru plunged into the water like a duckweed.

Zheng Dafu shifted to a deeper, gentler area, staring at the water’s surface, muttering to himself, “Is there truly such a handsome man in the world? The more I look, the more I want to punch him.”

Finally, Zheng Dafu passed by Ruan Qiong’s earliest sword forge. 

He arrived at the stone arch bridge, where the corridor bridge had long been dismantled, revealing the true form of the old stone bridge.

Alone, Zheng Dafu sat on the stone bridge.

He turned his gaze to the north of the small town, where the Old Porcelain Mountain and many nearby dragon kilns stood.

He withdrew his gaze.

Thirty centuries ago, that swiftly rising, swiftly disappearing sword immortal had made a mistake, suddenly gaining fame only to seek to kill dragons, causing chaos and aiming to become the first sword cultivator to break the ascension realm.

The most accomplished scholar from Central Continent, after all, was not a sword cultivator but merely a scholar. Otherwise, the entire structure of the Vast World might have changed.

Yet regarding this secret matter, the old man who surely knew the answer never provided one. Zheng Dafu had once tried to subtly ask Li Er, hoping his senior brother would inquire, but Li Er agreed only to leave it at that.

There was no other way. Thankfully, he could still endure a few curses. In the past, if the old man was willing to speak to him, just ten words would make Zheng Dafu feel like it was the New Year.

So, he only knew that the world’s last true dragon had not attempted to seek those ancient underwater forbidden areas but had instead emerged from the Old Dragon City, breaking through an underground dragon path and eventually falling within the territory of the Great Li.

In search of protection, it sought to have some ancient existence reopen the ascension platform, retreating into those unknown places that sages found hard to reach.

But that old man chose to stand by and watch, ultimately leading to the creation of one of the thirty-six small caves, the Lih Zhu Cave.

The three teachings united, four sages set rules, crafting the archway that would be humorously referred to as the Crab Square by the locals of Lih Zhu Cave in later generations.

The Great Li’s Song family, on the original arch bridge, built another corridor bridge to ensure the longevity and flourishing of the Great Li’s national power, striving for supremacy.

Before leaving, Song Changjing specifically instructed Prince Song Jixin to offer incense at the steps of the corridor bridge.

Those who worshipped were all the tragic and unjustly slain descendants of the Great Li’s Song family.

Old Supervisor Song Yuzhang personally took charge of this matter, effectively overseeing the bloody internal strife within the Great Li’s Song family.

Ultimately, under the order of the influential lady who prioritized giving birth to sons above all else, the attendant of the fallen general Lu had his head severed and placed in a box, sent to the capital of Great Li.

After his death, Song Yuzhang, as a spirit, became the mountain god of the Fallen Mountain, a matter that could be seen as compensation from the Great Li emperor to this significant figure or a form of punishment. After all, Song Yuzhang had offended the old emperor’s bottom line by daring to develop a father-son bond with Song Jixin. 

And Song Jixin, indeed, held a complex mix of resentment and admiration toward Song Yuzhang. As the illegitimate son of the supervisor, living comfortably in Mud Bottle Alley, Song Jixin viewed Song Yuzhang as his biological father during those leisurely days, feeling both anger and admiration.

Unintentionally, he recalled the dusty medicine shop in Old Dragon City.

In truth, Zheng Dafu felt a sense of nostalgia.

People rarely think fondly of good times; what’s done is done. Instead, it's the bittersweet memories that linger.

Zheng Dafu leaned back, using his hands as a pillow, closing his eyes and murmuring, “Is it so hard not to consider oneself superior while treating others as fools? The world is strange.”

Ruan Xiu returned to Longquan Sword Sect.

She arranged to meet Pei Qian and Zhou Mili at the New Year's shop in Qilong Alley.

Today, the three sat together in front of the shop, basking in the sun.

Ruan Xiu noticed that Xiaomi Li seemed to be avoiding her; even the stories of the mountains and waters in Northern Julu were less smooth than before. Looking closely, Ruan Xiu quickly grasped the situation.

In any case, it was related to the Jade Liquid River Water Deity’s estate. The specifics didn’t pique her curiosity, and she didn’t feel the need to press a young girl for details.

Ruan Xiu simply enjoyed her peach blossom cake, which cost her nothing.

In truth, she was among the earliest shopkeepers of both shops.

Pei Qian said, “Sister Xiu, I’ve traveled far and wide on this trip.”

Ruan Xiu smiled, “That’s impressive!”

Pei Qian nodded vigorously, “Very impressive! I’m starting to admire myself!”

Pei Qian hesitated for a moment before softly asking, “Sister Xiu, have you traveled far as well?”

Ruan Xiu thought for a moment and casually replied, “From the heavens to the earth, across the five lakes and four seas, through ancient mountains and deep abysses, I have traveled everywhere. Wherever the sun shines, there are my footprints. Wherever the light of fire spreads, that is my territory.”

Zhou Mili hurriedly raised both hands, though she didn’t clap, “Wow, Sister Xiu, you’re the best! Sister Xiu, you must have changed your shoes many times, right?”

Ruan Xiu smiled, “Not too many.”

Zhou Mili finished her story with great effort and then went next door to chat with Jiu Er.

Pei Qian had told her not to mention anything about the matters in Hongzhu Town. Although Zhou Mili had initially forgotten, after Pei Qian brought it up, she kept thinking about it even in her sleep, causing her to lose her appetite for meals and snacks. So, seeing Sister Xiu today, she felt extremely uncomfortable.

Ruan Xiu stood up, “Let’s go have some fun.”

Pei Qian followed suit, “Sister Xiu, let’s not go to the Jade Liquid River.”

Ruan Xiu smiled with narrowed eyes, ruffling the little girl’s hair, “Liking you and Xiaomi Li’s stories is one thing; how I conduct myself is my own decision.”

Just then, Pei Qian began to stamp her feet anxiously, scratching her head in a fluster, not knowing what to do.

Fortunately, Zhu Lian arrived and said to Pei Qian, “It’s alright.”

Pei Qian beamed, “Old chef, are you addicted to appearing and disappearing mysteriously?”

Zhu Lian stepped into the New Year’s shop.

Pei Qian followed behind, grinning, “Family discount, 20% off.”

Zhu Lian laughed, “Actually, I know a bit about making pastries myself. The golden date paste cake is quite famous; I came up with the recipe myself.”

Pei Qian looked skeptical. “Isn’t that the expensive date cake from the capital of Nanyuan?”

Zhu Lian clasped his hands behind his back, surveying the various pastries in the shop, and nodded, “You didn’t expect that, did you?”

Pei Qian praised, “Old chef, you truly have the heart of a cook. It’s a pity your looks aren’t great; otherwise, even at your age, you wouldn’t be single!”

Zhu Lian simply grunted.

Shi Rou had a strange expression.

Ruan Xiu, riding the wind, hesitated for a moment and reluctantly used her illusion technique.

Upon entering the Jade Liquid River, the water instantly boiled, as if the sun had plunged beneath the surface, igniting a blazing furnace.

The heavens roared with might.

Ruan Xiu walked into the grand hall of the water deity’s estate. The water goddess, who had been leaning against the waterworks to repair her golden form, was now kneeling on the ground, trembling, not even knowing why she felt compelled to beg for death upon seeing this woman. 

Ruan Xiu crossed the steps, turned, and sat on the main seat of the hall, her posture slightly slanted as she propped her chin on one hand, gazing into the distance.

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 756: A Blank Sheet from Cui Dongshan (Part 1)

Zhu Lian arrived at the New Year's shop, dissatisfied that it hadn’t been opened in a while. The kitchen had become more of a display than a functional space, so he sent Pei Qian to buy some groceries, saying they should prepare a meal to liven things up.

Pei Qian was worried about her sister Xiu who was headed to Yu Ye River and was reluctant to leave, suggesting they wait for Xiu to return. Instead, she proposed they go next door to the nearby grass-roots shop, which was bustling with activity every day. "We could just eat there; Miss Jiu'er’s cooking is quite good, and the smell of her dishes wafts all the way through Qilong Alley." 

Zhu Lian disagreed, saying that every shop had its own unique atmosphere. While they could mooch off the food, they couldn’t bring back the vibe. "Where does the energy come from? It’s all about daily life—having smoke from cooking fires, bedding aired out, and the sound of reading. Just the sound of an abacus clicking won’t do; it’s tough to hold onto wealth in this world without a bit of warmth to gather people at home."

Pei Qian was at a loss. Old Chef was indeed particular about his rules, and even if she couldn't argue with him, she decided to take her little guardian, Xiaomi, and head to a nearby street shop to buy some wild game and vegetables. Meanwhile, Shi Rou, feeling guilty and scared, thought that Zhu Lian was subtly criticizing her. After all, she hadn’t been able to help with the shop’s finances or maintain its good fortune. She secretly took out some of her own money and slipped it to Pei Qian. Pei Qian initially protested, saying it would be more appropriate to charge it to the shop's account, but before Shi Rou could take the money back, Pei Qian stuffed a bag of coins into her sleeve, stomped her foot, and complained, "Shi Rou, you’re really being too formal. Let this be the last time!" Then she whisked Xiaomi away, calling out cheerfully as they disappeared in an instant.

The town had now become the county seat of Huaihuang County, with bustling streets and numerous shops. Many began selling antiques, most of which were looked down upon by the Bull Horn Mountain’s Baozi Zhai, but if they sold even one, it could fetch several pieces of heavenly currency, enough to buy a house in the new county. In truth, the grass-roots shop in Qilong Alley was quite famous now; the items on display were expensive but genuine, so not many people bought them, although plenty came to look.

Countless scholars from the Great Li dynasty visited the town, paying respects at the Old Porcelain Mountain and the Immortal Tomb at the Literary and Martial Temple, exploring the many peaks where immortals were said to reside, visiting the Piyun Mountain and the Lin Deer Academy. Those who rode the immortal ferries down from Bull Horn Mountain were often students traveling to learn, flipping their sightseeing routes: the peach trees in Tao Ye Alley, the iron chain well near Xinghua Alley, the New Year’s shop selling pastries and dried fruits, the grass-roots shop that seemed to sell miscellaneous goods yet had its roots in the immortal realm, and the new academy established by the Chen family at Longwei Creek. These places were often must-visit spots for outsiders.

The little town bustled with activity, full of people coming and going.

Zhu Lian went to the kitchen, but found the water tank empty. He grabbed a carrying pole and balanced two buckets on his shoulders. Nowadays, fetching water from the iron chain well was no longer possible as it had been sealed off. The Great Li court had drilled several new wells in the town to prevent the common folk from having trouble getting water. However, the older locals often lamented that the taste was off, saying it couldn’t compare to the sweet water from the locked Dragon Well. Life had to go on, and while they didn’t mind complaining, the old folks missed the shade of the old locust tree, which had once provided respite from the sun. Yet, the children of the new generation, with their snotty faces and split trousers, seemed to be living carefree and joyful lives.

With the New Year’s shop momentarily empty, Shi Rou sat alone behind the counter, feeling a bit out of place. She pondered what groceries Pei Qian would bring back and imagined Zhu Lian later tying on an apron, wielding a spatula in the kitchen, which made her chuckle. Glancing out at the evening glow, it felt as if the day was slowly returning home after a long day’s work.

Next door, the grass-roots shop under the auspices of Falling Fortune Mountain was doing much better than her own shop, which seemed more cluttered and complicated despite the appearance of thicker account books. Selling even one item there equaled years of profit for the New Year’s shop. The blind old Daoist, Jia Sheng, had become less visible lately, having hit a bottleneck in his cultivation. He entrusted the shop's business to his two disciples: the taciturn, limping Zhao Denggao and the clever, sprightly Tian Jiu'er.

Jia Sheng spent more than half the year cultivating at the newly acquired Huanghu Mountain, a dependency of Falling Fortune Mountain, and paid little attention to worldly affairs.

Most Daoists were like this.

Ordinary people spent half their lives in bed, while Qi practitioners spent the majority of their lives in meditation, away from the world and severing ties with mundane matters. What they called "descending the mountain for experience" was merely a chance to test their resolve and cultivate their Dao heart. As Zhu Lian once casually mentioned to Pei Qian, cultivating on the mountain was fundamentally about probing the heavenly heart with one’s own heart, merely sitting in stillness. While it could yield some results, it was exceedingly difficult to achieve great success, which is why there was the saying, “In stillness, one thinks of action,” prompting some to actively engage with the world.

These immortals, having distanced themselves from human affairs, were accustomed to the mountain winds and the falling pine nuts. According to Zhu Lian, what of their hearts? Not much. It was merely a fist-sized matter, with varying realms, and as for the journey of the heart, it was long. Time on the mountain, spanning hundreds of years, was unlikely to surpass the short lives of ordinary folk down below in terms of distance traveled. The length of the heart’s journey depended on interactions with people. After all, there were fewer people on the mountain.

Shi Rou thought there was some merit in this line of reasoning, even if it seemed a bit off.

As for their young mountain lord, he was quite the outlier, never idle. He left such a large family business unattended, spending more time wandering outside than enjoying a life of luxury and cultivation on his own mountain.

It was said that the reason why that well-watered mountain could be acquired was due to Chen Lingjun’s significant contributions. The deal between Falling Fortune Mountain and Huanghu Mountain was made with mutual agreement, with the Dragon Prefecture’s governor’s office, along with the Ministry of Rites and the Ministry of Revenue, recording it all. Huanghu Mountain quietly became an asset under the young mountain lord’s name. Shi Rou felt distant from the old Daoist Jia, who was so consumed with ambitions of acquiring the mountain, thinking he was too much of a money-grubber. 

The geomancy of Huanghu Mountain was no simple matter; was it something that Jia Sheng could just covet?

After they became nominal deities of Falling Fortune Mountain, Jia Sheng had transformed into two different people. Previously, he was overly polite to Shi Rou, making small talk even when there was nothing to discuss, and would linger around for a long time to subtly get close. However, ever since the three of them were recognized as nominal deities, he hadn’t once visited the New Year’s shop. Shi Rou understood; he was putting on airs, and though she thought about going to the next door to say a few encouraging words, she stubbornly refused.

In the past, preoccupied with fear and worry, she hadn’t given much thought to the past few years of peace, but now she was starting to reflect on it.

The young mountain lord’s ability to purchase mountain land was truly astute, always managing to profit significantly, and he never flaunted his wealth. A poor youth from Mud Bottle Alley, who had never attended school, had never shown any desire to boast after becoming successful, which was indeed rare. However, to say he was stingy was far from the truth; even Shi Rou, who contributed little, found him to be quite generous. The mountain heads he acquired were all at extremely low prices. Moreover, Huanghu Mountain had several ready-made immortal residences, all handed over to the ancestral hall of Falling Fortune Mountain. The same went for Zhu Sha Mountain, and Bull Horn Mountain even had a ready-made ferry landing, alongside the shops built with a significant amount of heavenly currency from Baozi Zhai, all falling into the hands of Falling Fortune Mountain.

As Zhu Lian returned from drawing water, Pei Qian and Xiaomi, each carrying a bamboo basket, arrived right behind him.

Xiaomi helped start the fire, puffing her cheeks as she handled the bellows, while Pei Qian selected vegetables and teased Xiaomi to be careful not to blow the whole stove away. Xiaomi laughed, inhaling a mouthful of ashes, and Pei Qian laughed heartily, while Xiaomi giggled, saying she almost ate enough to be full. The old chef tied on his apron, carefully washed the cutting board with well water, and sharpened the cleaver, ready to show off his skills.

Shi Rou wanted to help but found herself unable to contribute, so she stood at the kitchen door, feeling somewhat unnecessary yet unwilling to leave, so she just remained there like a guardian.

In truth, Shi Rou didn’t feel embarrassed; she had always been like this. Watching the lively atmosphere in the kitchen, it felt as if the festive spirit of the New Year had already arrived, even if the holiday wasn’t quite here yet.

Zhu Lian sliced the vegetables with a knife, his movements fluid and graceful, pleasing to the eye. 

Pei Qian, standing nearby, praised, "What great knife skills! Old chef, why don’t you use your knife in a duel?"

Without raising his head, Zhu Lian chuckled, “A kitchen knife? If one must carry a weapon, wouldn’t it be more impressive to wield a sword on a journey?”

Pei Qian replied helplessly, “I find it strange; you certainly weren’t handsome when you were young, so where do all these fancy ideas come from?”

Zhu Lian remarked, “Exactly because I wasn’t handsome, I had to fuss about it; otherwise, what's the point? If I didn’t care, I’d be just another broken pot, and who would want to marry me then?”

Pei Qian inquired, “So, have you found someone or not? With our status in the martial world so far apart, and your reputation not being that great, I haven’t heard much about your exploits.”

Zhu Lian casually mentioned, “The Golden Cake with Jujube Paste, you’ve certainly heard about it in the capital of the South Garden Kingdom, right?”

Pei Qian’s eyes widened as she whispered, “Walls have ears! You’re such an old hand at this! How can you be so careless? I regret bringing up the matter of that kingdom and capital; you had already made a mistake, and now you’re making it worse."

Zhu Lian nodded with a smile, “You’re right; I’ll be more careful in the future.”

Pei Qian asked, “Do you know if Master Shizi and Cao Muto will dare to return this year?”

Zhu Lian shook his head, “Doubtful. Scholars who reach that Bosa Continent act like women visiting the Upside-Down Mountain; they just go for a stroll.”

Pei Qian then asked, “So who will write the Spring Festival couplets this year? Master’s ancestral home, Falling Fortune Mountain, the Ancestral Hall at Jisi Peak, the Bamboo Pavilion, and all those other mountain peaks—it seems like there’s a lot to write!”

Zhu Lian laughed, “If you can’t manage it, both I and Brother Dafu can help.”

Pei Qian frowned, “If you help, old chef, I might consider it, but what about Zheng Dafu’s calligraphy? Can anyone even read it? I'm worried his characters are so ominous that they’ll scare off the spirits and demons, but I don’t want our good fortune to be scared away too.”

Zhu Lian assured her, “Brother Dafu is quite talented at heart; aside from chess, his writing and knowledge are both commendable.”

Then Zhu Lian suddenly said, “Forget it; let’s not have Brother Dafu help after all.”

Pei Qian laughed.

Sitting on the little stool by the stove, Xiaomi had been holding the bamboo bellows, her face full of confusion. Pei Qian, sitting beside her, explained softly, “Complimenting someone’s talents is actually a way of calling them ugly.”

Xiaomi glanced at the old chef, then at Shi Rou, thought about Zheng Dafu’s appearance, and grinned widely. In Falling Fortune Mountain’s household, it seemed only Wei Shanjun's looks were somewhat fitting for the mountain scenery.

Zhu Lian suggested that Shi Rou should sauté a couple of simple dishes as well.

Shi Rou was hesitant but didn’t dare refuse, so Zhu Lian adjusted his apron and settled at the kitchen door.

After finishing her sunflower seeds, Pei Qian started counting with her fingers, “My master, Wei Shanjun, the big white goose, and the reverend Zhou Fei—there are actually quite a few good-looking people at Falling Fortune Mountain.”

Xiaomi put her hand over her mouth and leaned close to Pei Qian’s ear, whispering, “The mountain sects can actually make money selling illusions, but it’s been said that the easiest money in the world is made from the immortal treasures.”

Pei Qian promptly grabbed Xiaomi’s ear, “What are you thinking? My master can’t make that kind of money!”

Xiaomi quickly corrected herself, “He can’t, absolutely can’t!”

Pei Qian released her and grinned, “But the big white goose, Wei Shanjun, and Zhou Fei could sell their good looks to make some money; who knows, they might actually bring in a fortune.”

Xiaomi hurriedly mimicked the motions of flipping through a book.

Pei Qian nodded, “Great! We can note that down in the accounts.”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “This is a good idea; next time when we discuss matters at the Ancestral Hall, we can bring it up.”

Pei Qian, focusing her voice, spoke to the old chef, “At the Great Sword Qi Great Wall, I saw a sword immortal named Mi Yu, who looked decent but was a bit foolish. When he gazed at the scenery, the mountains were filled with flowers, and he was so distracted he nearly got sliced by our Master and the big white goose when he provoked us. He could actually make up for his mistake by coming to Falling Fortune Mountain as the chief errand disciple, joining the big white goose and the others to help the mountain earn enough money to return home.”

Zhu Lian nodded, “Falling Fortune Mountain indeed needs a sword immortal to uphold its honor, even if it’s just for show.”

Then Zhu Lian suddenly burst out laughing, not explaining the reason to Pei Qian and Xiaomi.

Cui Dongshan had reached the fifth realm.

Wei Ban, the younger brother, was also at the fifth realm, and the lord of North Yu Mountain.

Reverend Zhou Fei, or Jiang Shangzhen, was even more of an immortal, now the sect master of the Jade Guizong.

If they added Mi Yu, the sword immortal of the Jade Purity realm...

These four were all individuals who wouldn’t mind getting their hands dirty, earning the kind of celestial riches that came from illusions.

Zhu Lian leaned back, glancing at the old spring festival couplets hanging in the main hall, weathered from wind and rain after a year of guarding the entrance. They were due for a change soon.

Zhu Lian explained, “The way we invite spring couplets in my hometown is a bit different. There’s a two-part invitation: one is during the Spring Festival when we put up the spring couplets, and the other is the day before the second of February, when we take them down. They then go for a walk in the incense burner, completing their purpose. According to old sayings, these spring couplets serve as offerings for the deities, and after that, we have to write and invite them again to protect the feng shui of every household. The character ‘Fu’ (福) should be pasted inside the house, not on the front door. It’s said that good fortune reaches the doorstep but doesn’t enter; some families, with their ancestors’ virtuous deeds and righteous family traditions, manage to keep it, while others simply can’t, so it’s best to paste it inside.”

Pei Qian rolled her eyes, “I’ve been wandering the martial world from a young age, making my home wherever I go, so what do I know about these rituals?”

At this point, Pei Qian whispered to Xiaomi, “It’s really just that we don’t even have a place to stay.”

Xiaomi nodded vigorously, “That’s how it is! Wandering! I like that word; it’s nice. I’m also a little wanderer who enjoys roaming around the Mute Lake.”

Xiaomi raised both hands, gesturing as if she were wandering around.

Pei Qian loved chatting with Xiaomi because she could talk about childhood stories without fear of embarrassment, as Xiaomi didn’t even recognize the difference between wealth and poverty.

Pei Qian pressed down on Xiaomi’s head, giving it a playful shake.

Zhu Lian remarked, “Strength doesn’t lie in weight.”

Pei Qian asked, “Is there a saying about that?”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “Do you think I was too rough with that Water Goddess of Yu Ye River?”

Pei Qian nodded, “It wasn’t exactly gentle.”

Zhu Lian then questioned, “Then what was the punch for?”

Pei Qian thought for a moment before replying, “To reason with her, earn money, and save her.”

Nobody understood Sister Xiu like Pei Qian did.

Zhu Lian further asked, “Where does the trouble lie?”

Pei Qian answered, “As a water deity, being in the martial realm, her conduct isn’t proper; she’s focused solely on making connections with heroes and immortals, neglecting the feng shui and the people in her territory.”

Zhu Lian nodded, “Very good. You could venture out into the martial world on your own now.”

Pei Qian rolled her eyes, “Without Master’s permission, I won’t leave the mountain!”

Xiaomi chimed in, “The outside martial world can be very dangerous!”

Soon after, they set the dishes on the table, not too lavish, but there was plenty of rice.

When Pei Qian was at the table, the main seat had to be left empty; during festivals, they even had to set up bowls and chopsticks there.

As the four were about to start eating, Ruan Xiu stepped from the front of the New Year’s shop into the backyard, standing at the threshold and saying, “Dinner is ready!”

Pei Qian stood up, exclaiming, “Haha, better late than never! Sister Xiu, come join us; I’ll share a stool with you!”

Ruan Xiu smiled, “Sure!”

Shi Rou quickly got up, grabbed some bowls and chopsticks, and sat with Xiaomi.

Xiaomi filled Ruan Xiu's bowl with a generous serving of rice, packing it tightly with the rice scoop, and brought it to the table.

Ruan Xiu patted the little girl’s head, sat down, picked up her chopsticks, and noticing everyone else had yet to start, smiled, “Let’s eat!”

Pei Qian hesitated, glancing toward the front of the New Year’s shop.

There stood the Water Goddess of Yu Ye River, who appeared anxious and unstable.

Regarding the apology, the Water Palace had provided one, but it wasn’t her personally visiting Falling Fortune Mountain; rather, it was the second-in-command from the Water Palace who came with a treasured artifact. She believed that was sufficient sincerity.

As for the old man who claimed to have a way to save her, she hadn’t taken it seriously at all.

Not only that, she had already written a secret missive intended for the Minister of Rites.

The Water Palace had a water monster from the Huangting Kingdom, which had brazenly summoned a Dragon King’s basket, attempting to suppress the shrine of the Water Goddess of Yu Ye River, intimidating the common folk, nearly causing a tragedy where the entire shrine’s populace would have perished.

Zhu Lian, managing Falling Fortune Mountain, had recklessly injured a local water deity who had contributed to the community.

Before sending that missive, she had advised her colleague from the Water God of the Danjiang River to bear the storm for a while; for their sake, it was best to maintain peace.

But how could she take it to heart? Besides, that colleague, a newly appointed deity with a godly status, had never earned her respect.

As for the convoluted backstory, she was an outsider to it all.

Ruan Xiu came from the Longquan Sword Sect, the famous daughter of Saint Ruan Qiong, but would she truly be willing to clash with the entire water laws of the Great Li for such matters?

Before the impending accident, everything had its reasoning.

Once she was detained in this little town at Qilong Alley, the Water Goddess of Yu Ye River felt like crying without tears.

That table of people felt like a harmonious family, eating their homemade meal.

The Water Goddess seemed to hold an empty bowl of cold rice, unable to even partake in the meal.

After finishing the meal, aside from Shi Rou cleaning the dishes, everyone else moved to the shop.

Ruan Xiu was choosing pastries.

Pei Qian stood behind the counter with Xiaomi, both standing on a little stool; otherwise, Xiaomi was too short to see anything.

Zhu Lian sat on a long bench, smiling as he spoke, “In street fights, a punch lands on whom, it hurts. In dueling with immortals, whoever takes a hit from a magical treasure—fundamentally, the principle is the same. If we really want to argue about it, there’s no distinction between right or wrong; wealth and status don’t matter. Do you understand, Lady Water Goddess?”

The Water Goddess nodded.

She didn’t truly understand, and even if she did, she wouldn’t accept it. However, given the circumstances, what other choice did she have?

If that Xiaomi wasn’t recognized as a disciple of Falling Fortune Mountain, if Falling Fortune Mountain hadn’t had ‘her’ step in to teach her a lesson, would things have come to this?

In the end, both sides were just travelers, exerting pressure on one another.

Ruan Xiu, with her back to everyone, frowned.

Zhu Lian smiled, “Pei Qian, take Xiaomi to the back.”

Pei Qian responded, “Oh!” and patted Xiaomi’s head.

Immediately, the Water Goddess knelt on the ground, facing the counter, saying, “I was wrong.”

Pei Qian scratched her head, exasperated, “Why does it have to be so complicated? It’s really just a matter of sincerely admitting a mistake! How is that so hard? How can you think that just because you’ve gone through the motions of courtesy, that everything is fine?”

Then Pei Qian lay her head down on the table, “I don’t like this. It’s all so simple—if that official from the Water Palace just apologized to Xiaomi and said sorry, wouldn’t that suffice? Yet the old woman and the official are calculating so many things—whether they admit their mistakes or not, each with their own malicious intentions, like a pile of black water weeds scaring people. What’s that all about?”

Zhu Lian chuckled, “You’re wrong; that’s truly the most challenging part for us. If others saw or heard this, they’d think we’re being unreasonable, making a big fuss over nothing, being aggressive. And what would make you angrier is that these outsiders’ empathy isn’t entirely a bad thing; on the contrary, it’s the baseline that keeps the world from becoming too terrible.”

Pei Qian felt a headache coming on, grumbling, “But we can’t just blow this out of proportion; if we killed a Water Goddess, how would outsiders view Falling Fortune Mountain? You’ve said it before; outsiders would side with Yu Ye River. Besides, I think even if this Water Goddess doesn’t admit her mistakes, it wouldn’t be necessary to kill her. If Master were here, how would he handle it?”

Zhu Lian thought for a moment and replied, “Perhaps the young master could sort out the entire Water Palace of Yu Ye River from top to bottom, inside and out. Right and wrong, it’s neither more nor less.”

However, there were some matters Zhu Lian chose not to share with Pei Qian, such as the connections entangled with the Qingfeng City Xu family, Zhengyang Mountain, and even further implications.

Dazed, Xiaomi had quietly bent her knees, hiding her head behind the counter.

“I know nothing; if I’m not in the shop, no one can see me…”

Zhu Lian wasn’t in a hurry.

All this could help Pei Qian cultivate her heart.

Otherwise, Zhu Lian would have already moved along with Miss Ruan’s actions.

Just like Pei Qian understood in her heart, the true nemesis of the Yu Ye River Water Palace was actually her sister Xiu.

It was possible she would either shatter the Water Goddess’s golden body or refine the entire Yu Ye River, leaving only the Water Goddess alive. If she thought that all matters, big or small, weren’t an issue, then she could use her logic to negotiate with the Great Li court.

Replacing her with a more responsible Water Deity would be quite simple for the current Great Li court.

As for some possibilities, ordinary people wouldn’t think of them, such as a little spirit being taken away, leading to the destruction of a mountain. As long as the incident hadn’t occurred, it wouldn’t be a consideration. Discussing hearts and matters has always been a difficult balance.

Pei Qian tentatively asked, “Old chef, how about we just let it go? I can’t figure it out, and I’ll ask Master when he returns.”

Zhu Lian smiled and nodded, looking at Ruan Xiu.

Ruan Xiu pinched a piece of peach blossom cake and popped it in her mouth, turning her head to mumble, “I’m easy-going.”

Ruan Xiu glanced at the kneeling Water Goddess, “Aren’t you leaving?”

The Water Goddess hurriedly fled.

She was furious at the Xu family of Qingfeng City, and even more so at the subordinate official who had provoked the trouble.

As for Falling Fortune Mountain, she didn’t dare harbor any resentment.

And towards that “Ruan Xiu,” she didn’t even dare to think.

Zhu Lian said to Pei Qian, “Cultivation isn’t about being unreasonable; it’s about better articulating reason. Within our capabilities, we should help the weak clarify their reasoning. There’s a world of difference between that and having a high realm of cultivation, where one’s fists become the reasoning.”

Then Zhu Lian added with a smile, “Just take your time; every act of kindness may vary in size, but kindness itself is kindness, without distinction.”

Ruan Xiu continued to select pastries, saying, “It’s really not that complicated.”

Pei Qian asked, “Sister Xiu, what do you mean?”

Ruan Xiu replied, “Just focus on your cultivation.”

Zhu Lian sighed in relief; he was genuinely afraid this young lady might say something shocking or unconventional.

Ruan Xiu picked up a piece of pastry, smiling, “Fresh pastries are indeed delicious.”

Pei Qian looked troubled, “I’m cultivating at a turtle’s pace.”

Xiaomi peeked out, saying, “Actually, turtles swim quickly in the water and can run on land; they’re quite fast! I’ve chased after them many times at Mute Lake!”

Pei Qian pressed her hand down on Xiaomi’s head, “What’s that about?”

Xiaomi shook her head and suddenly brought up a question she often thought about but forgot, “Why do some people like to bully others?”

Zhu Lian couldn’t help but chuckle. 

This question was indeed difficult to answer.

Ruan Xiu replied, “When people are hungry, they consume everything.”

Xiaomi laughed heartily, “Sister Xiu is great; you only like eating pastries!”

Zhu Lian remained silent.

Pei Qian blinked.

Ruan Xiu smiled. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 **Chapter 757: A Blank Sheet for Cui Dongshan (Part Two)**

A master and a maid, two riders journeyed south through the wind and snow.

Their destination was the southernmost point of the Treasure Bottle Continent, the Old Dragon City. However, their route was anything but straightforward; they detoured multiple times, visiting the Fox Kingdom of the Xu family in Clear Wind City, passing through the Stone Hair Kingdom, and stopping by the Book Slip Lake.

The young man sat atop his horse, dozing off. The maid, riding behind him, dared not ride alongside, keeping a respectful distance.

In Mud Bottle Alley, Song Jixin had a maid following him, and in Apricot Blossom Alley, this fellow, Ma Ku Xuan, also learned from him and took on a maid, naming her Shudian.

Behind them, Shudian likely couldn’t fathom the true reason she was still alive; it was simply because of this arrangement.

On their journey south, they encountered no more ambushes or assassinations, as those willing to protect her had all died.

The state of affairs on the Treasure Bottle Continent had gradually shifted from chaos to stability. However, because Ma Ku Xuan never took fairy boats and preferred to travel on horseback, he avoided the main roads, inevitably crossing paths with various beings—lost mountain dwellers, strange creatures, and spirits of the land who trembled at the thought of being marked as unclean. Many were exiled nobles, lamenting their lost kingdoms, while others, suddenly risen to power, arrogantly boasted about how great their Da Li was.

Ma Ku Xuan killed without hesitation, guided solely by his whims.

Those of higher realms whom he found displeasing would be slain; those of lower realms would meet the same fate. Even if one were not a cultivator, encountering Ma Ku Xuan would spell doom.

Yet Shudian still wondered why this heavily murderous prodigy could survive on the road, engaging in long conversations with woodcutters and farmers when he felt in good spirits.

Not long ago, in the Stone Hair Kingdom, Ma Ku Xuan had dispatched a group of elite young nobles who had come to admire the snow-capped mountains. They had seen the beautiful Shudian and mistakenly thought that Ma Ku Xuan and his maid, leading their horses, were nobility from their own Stone Hair Kingdom. All of them were born into the influential families of the capital, and with twisted thoughts, they approached her. The Stone Hair Kingdom had been ravaged by war, making it common for ordinary people to face unfortunate accidents when they traveled.

Ma Ku Xuan mounted his horse and presented Shudian with two choices: either strip naked and submit to their humiliation or demonstrate the demeanor of a fairy cultivator and slaughter the group of young lords.

Shudian’s face turned pale, even whiter than the snow.

Ma Ku Xuan, impatient, flicked his fingers, sending one of the young lords plummeting off a cliff. The sound of his scream was chilling, but the rest followed suit, all tumbling down, some even met their end crashing into the rocks. During this chaos, a local earth deity rushed out to plead for mercy for the noble youths, but he too was struck down by Ma Ku Xuan with a single slap. The balance of fate momentarily shifted towards Ma Ku Xuan, causing the deity to retreat.

In the end, Shudian was forced to suppress her cultivation level, bound by ropes, and dragged behind Ma Ku Xuan as they descended the mountain.

When they reached the foot of the mountain, Ma Ku Xuan finally released his magical restraint. Although Shudian was a cultivator and not seriously harmed, she was left in disarray, dazed and sitting in the snow.

It seemed Ma Ku Xuan had forgotten about the maid entirely, as he rode off alone.

After a long hesitation, Shudian, still battered by the wind and snow, mounted her horse and followed him.

At that moment, Ma Ku Xuan simply remarked with a laugh, “My killing spree is real, but to kill the innocent would be a misunderstanding.”

Shudian, emboldened by a sudden surge of courage, cried out, “You’ve killed so many! Many of them didn’t deserve death!”

Ma Ku Xuan chuckled, “The truly innocent who die aren’t as fortunate as you; they can’t even live to raise their voices.”

Finally, Ma Ku Xuan gazed at the sky and smiled, “In this manner of killing, heaven must thank me.”

Shudian sat slumped on her horse, utterly exhausted, mumbling, “You’re a madman, a madman.”

Ma Ku Xuan yawned and continued his leisurely ride.

Shudian silently told herself not to die, absolutely not to die. She had to see this madman; surely, someone who committed so many wrongs would face heavenly retribution!

Yet she soon noticed that this madman seemed to be in a good mood.

In fact, after passing Book Slip Lake, Ma Ku Xuan appeared even more cheerful.

In the southern mountains of Book Slip Lake, where various rogue cultivators gathered, Ma Ku Xuan had the leisure to visit a mountain peak as a guest. Sitting in the main seat, he asked a few questions and became even happier.

That guy from Mud Bottle Alley had been here for nearly three years, and apparently, things hadn’t been going well for him.

But Ma Ku Xuan was in high spirits.

He scooped up a snowball and turned to toss it at Shudian’s head. She didn’t dare dodge, and the snowball burst, scattering snowflakes and slightly obscuring her vision.

Stretching lazily, Ma Ku Xuan laughed, “Back in that little town, I’ve never played in a snowball fight. Well, I have, but I often got hit for no reason. Seeing them happy made me happy too.”

Thinking of that little town, that Pearl Cave, Shudian felt a chill run down her spine.

Everything today was a consequence of that journey.

Ma Ku Xuan waved, signaling her to follow.

He said, “During the opening of the Pearl Cave, you and your group are the last chosen. Don’t you have any thoughts about it?”

Ma Ku Xuan continued talking to himself, “You probably didn’t think about it; you just go with the flow, never considering the shore.”

Shudian replied, “I have thought about it.”

Ma Ku Xuan turned his head, grinning, “Oh? So you do have some brains?”

She said, “Since you hold such lofty ambitions and treat me so poorly, what’s the point?”

Ma Ku Xuan couldn’t be bothered to answer such questions. Instead, he asked, “Do you remember the ones who entered the Pearl Cave before you?”

Shudian fell silent.

Ma Ku Xuan extended his hands, preparing to form another snowball, and continued speaking, “The last time the Da Li court opened its doors to guests, the earliest group to reach the little town and enter the Pearl Cave to seek treasures—how simple could that be? You lot who arrived later are also the carefully selected ones by the former Empress Song of Da Li and the Xiu Hu. You’re not useless, of course, except for you.”

“Speaking of which, you are utterly useless, but the Iron Tide cavalry you’re connected to is somewhat useful to Da Li.”

Ma Ku Xuan shook his head, “Unfortunately, by a stroke of bad luck, they ran into me.”

Shudian cried out in despair, “You said one person does the work, one person bears the blame. You also made the first mistake by deliberately acting against me, ruining my cultivation. Even if I made a grave mistake afterward, why didn’t you just kill me? Why unleash such a massacre?”

Ma Ku Xuan had already turned his thoughts elsewhere. After a moment, he asked, “What did you say just now?”

Shudian fell silent again.

Ma Ku Xuan didn’t mind. If her heart was completely shattered, it wouldn’t be fun anymore.

Suddenly, he asked, “How about I take on a disciple who will definitely like you and let him help you take revenge?”

Shudian was taken aback.

Ma Ku Xuan seemed excited, “What do you think? I promise he won’t kill you before he comes for me, and afterward, he won’t kill you either. You just have to watch the show. I’ll only remind you of one thing: don’t let him get too close, and don’t pretend to fall in love with him. I don’t care about that—it’s just that he might get tired of you, turn the tables, and kill you to pledge his loyalty to me. Wouldn’t that be disgusting?”

Shudian stared at this madman.

Cultivators were supposed to be heartless and indifferent.

But how many could be as extreme as the man before her?

Ma Ku Xuan pouted, “Whenever you figure it out, just speak to me. I’ll surely grant your wish.”

He weighed the snowball in his hand, gazing into the distance where snowflakes danced, the path ahead obscured, and the world was bleak.

Ma Ku Xuan’s thoughts drifted far away.

Years ago, when he had departed for Da Sui, he had taken out three items: a bowl of water, a stone, and a twig.

He had half-jokingly told his teacher and the little Bottle that a mortal scholar needed to undergo countless transformations, silently transitioning through life and death many times.

The stone represented the human body, akin to a mountain, enduring the elements, bearing all things—it was a state of relative stillness and flow.

The water in the bowl symbolized the flow of thoughts. The twig was the fundamental thread, the rules governing the movement of the Great Way.

Over these years, Ma Ku Xuan had been contesting himself in these matters.

However, merely grappling with the general concepts of emotions and desires was far from sufficient.

The first porcelain figure he created, the boy Cui Ci, who was often seen with Li Xisheng, was quite adept at basic calculations. Yet when it came to “emotion,” it remained weak. In simple terms, the thread was too fragile, making it difficult for him to feel a sense of belonging. Additionally, confined by his simplistic physical and spiritual existence, the bottleneck of the Great Way was too significant; even forming a golden core was a luxury.

But this “little brother Gao” in front of him had more thoughts and a clearer and stronger thread, enabling him not only to play chess but also to cultivate to the bottleneck of the Nascent Soul realm. He would also be able to compose poetry and create everything related to emotions, genuinely believing himself to be a true “human.” There was no such thing as a purely “immovable silence” in the world; everything was pieced together from countless tiny entities, forming visible realities. Every minuscule event weaves into a dreamlike life. Books would yellow, mountains would rise and fall, plants would flourish or wither, and people would live, age, fall ill, and die.

Ma Ku Xuan lightly tapped the end of his brush against the empty sheet of paper before him, staring at it intently.

Years ago, during his travels in Da Sui, he had taken out those three items: a bowl of water, a stone, and a twig. 

Moreover, he had half-jokingly remarked to his teacher and the little Bottle about how many times a mundane scholar needed to be reborn, transitioning through life and death silently.

The stone represented the human body, akin to a mountain, weathering the storm and bearing all things. It was a state of relative stillness and flow.

The water in the bowl symbolized the flow of thought. The twig represented the fundamental thread, the rules governing the Great Way’s movement.

Over the years, Ma Ku Xuan had been grappling with these concepts within himself.

Yet merely grappling with the general ideas of emotions and desires was far from being enough.

The first porcelain figure he crafted, the boy Cui Ci, who had been accompanying Li Xisheng, was already adept at basic calculations. However, when it came to “emotion,” he remained quite thin. In simple terms, the thread was fundamentally too fragile, making it hard for him to have a sense of belonging, and limited by his simple body and soul, the bottleneck of the Great Way was too large; forming a golden core was a luxury.

But the “little brother Gao” before him had more thoughts; his threads were clearer and firmer. In the future, not only would he be able to play chess and cultivate up to the bottleneck of the Nascent Soul, but he would also be able to compose poetry and create everything related to emotions, genuinely believing he was a true “human.” 

In this world, there was no such thing as a purely “motionless calm.” Everything was pieced together, built from countless minuscule entities into visible realities. Every tiny occurrence formed a life that felt dreamlike. Books would yellow, mountains would rise and fall, plants would grow or wither, and people would live, age, fall ill, and die.

Ma Ku Xuan continued tapping the end of his brush against the blank sheet, lost in thought. 

After all, during his travels through Da Sui, he had once taken out three items: a bowl of water, a stone, and a twig.

He had half-jokingly mentioned to his teacher and the little Bottle how many rebirths a mundane scholar must undergo, the silent transitions through life and death countless times.

The stone represented the human body, akin to a mountain, enduring the elements and bearing all things. It was essentially a relative state of stillness and flow.

The water in the bowl symbolized the flow of thought. The twig represented the fundamental thread, the rules governing the operation of the Great Way.

Over the years, Ma Ku Xuan had been contesting with these concepts.

However, merely grappling with the general concepts of emotions and desires was far from sufficient.

The first porcelain figure he crafted, the boy Cui Ci, who was often seen with Li Xisheng, was already proficient in basic calculations. Yet, when it came to “emotion,” it remained quite thin. In simple terms, the thread was fundamentally too fragile, making it hard for him to feel a sense of belonging. Moreover, confined by his simple physical and spiritual existence, the bottleneck of the Great Way was too significant; even forming a golden core was a luxury.

But right now, this “little brother Gao” was full of thoughts, with threads that were clearer and stronger. In the future, not only would he be able to play chess, but he could cultivate to the Nascent Soul bottleneck. He would also be able to compose poetry and create everything related to emotions, genuinely believing himself to be a true “human.” 

In the world, there was no such thing as a purely “immovable silence”; everything was pieced together from countless tiny entities, forming visible realities. Tiny events wove into a dreamlike life. Books would yellow, mountains would rise and fall, plants would flourish or wither, and people would live, age, fall ill, and die.

Ma Ku Xuan quietly sighed, feeling troubled.

He beckoned to little brother Gao, encouraging the child to run around the room carrying things.

With a swift flail of his snow-white sleeves, he affectionately ruffled the child’s hair, mimicking the older sister, and cheerfully exclaimed, “Little brother, why are you so obedient?”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 758: Waiting for Someone

In the southeastern region of Baoping Continent, a young man dressed in white paused in a deep mountain forest. Before him lay the dry riverbed of Yantai River, long abandoned and marked by clear signs of stone extraction from years past. It wasn’t a renowned quarry, but the creek was dry, and Cui Dongshan leaped into the riverbed, vigorously digging through stones and mud. Finally, he unearthed a slab of stone, just enough to make a passable inkstone. Tapping it lightly with his fingers and listening closely, he found the sound quality surprisingly good. He brushed off the dirt, growing more fond of it with each glance—such serendipitous finds were the most delightful, treasures that money could not buy. 

Cui Dongshan exhaled softly, smoothing out the stone's patterns and tiny crevices with his breath. After rubbing it against his cheek for a while, the stone's texture became even more exquisite in his hands. Meanwhile, a child squatted on the bank, his gaze blank, seemingly unable to comprehend what Cui Dongshan was doing. As Cui Dongshan climbed ashore, he accidentally dropped the inkstone, which landed squarely on the child’s head. Ultimately, Cui Dongshan emerged from the river, instructing the child to walk while balancing the stone on his head, forbidding him from using his hands for support.

Looking back at the riverbed, Cui Dongshan remarked, “Diving into the water and coming up on shore—truly a hero’s feat.”

He wandered aimlessly until nightfall, spending the night in a desolate graveyard. Lying on the ground, he used a thin blade of grass to carve an inscription onto the inkstone.

Then a young scholar appeared, squatting beside him with a smile. “I’ve seen you before; not bad, you’re quite the promising one. My senior brother might actually take a liking to you, willing to accept you as his disciple.”

Cui Dongshan, still holding the blade of grass, focused intently on the stone slab and asked, “You should thank me for helping you return to Baidi City. Aren’t you?”

The young scholar was none other than Liu Chicheng, who had previously visited Shujian Lake and Yunlou City.

Liu Chicheng chuckled, “I was supposed to stir up trouble in Baoping Continent, but now that I’m doing nothing, let’s call it even, shall we?”

Cui Dongshan scoffed, “You can forget that. You’ve been locked away for a thousand years; how do you expect to break out? You think I carefully selected you to help him escape by chance? Call it even? I might as well lock you back up and then we can talk about being even!”

Liu Chicheng plopped down, curious. “It’s been so long since I left Baidi City. How has your chess game been with my senior brother? Is his skill higher or lower than before?”

Cui Dongshan sat up, shook his sleeves, and wiped the inkstone with his arm. The inscription read: “Bathe in the sun and moon, both strong and spirited, defying the heavens.”

Cui Dongshan asked, “Who was it that sent you to Baoping Continent for refuge back then?”

Liu Chicheng grinned, “That I cannot say. In this world, we must prioritize loyalty.”

Cui Dongshan nodded, tracing his fingers over the sixteen-character inscription, each stroke appearing like the riverbed itself, with golden streams flowing through it. “Impressive, truly impressive.”

Liu Chicheng immediately added, “A life-saving grace is a great righteousness. That name, I can share.”

On Baoping Continent, this young man was unmatched, and it had little to do with his realm.

It was all about intellect.

In the bamboo loft of Luopo Mountain.

After copying books today, Pei Qian went to the bottom of a small bamboo box at her feet, rummaging through a large stack of densely written volumes. She finally pulled out a blank book, shook it gently, and laid it on the table, preparing to keep accounts related to the Divine Mansion of Yuyue River. 

Zhou Milu dashed into the room, carrying a small golden yoke. Pei Qian quickly reached out to block her empty account book, frowning. “How reckless! This is a vital place in Luopo Mountain. You don’t even knock when you enter?”

Zhou Milu quickly turned and ran outside, knocking on the door. When Pei Qian called for her to come in, the girl hurriedly skipped over the threshold, facing her desk and whispering, “The old chef’s brother, Big Feng, went to Hongzhu Town and came back with a sack full of books. The expenses are quite hefty!”

Pei Qian nodded, “We’ll check the accounts soon. This is official business; if we hurt the old chef’s feelings, that won’t do.”

Zhou Milu tiptoed, stretching her neck to see what Pei Qian was doing. “What are you writing?”

Pei Qian waved her hand. “Stand at the door and guard. No one is allowed in except for Warm Tree.”

Zhou Milu responded with a “Oh,” but then suddenly leaned over the table, her slightly yellow brows knitted in thought, as if she wanted to say something.

Pei Qian asked, puzzled, “What’s wrong?”

Zhou Milu lowered her voice and said, “The little incense burner from the city god’s temple, we know him, right? He’s still a friend. He wants to take my previous position as the right guardian of Qilong Alley. What do you think?”

Pei Qian thought for a moment and shook her head. “Not a chance. Although I can decide the two guardian positions of Qilong Alley by myself, we can’t just agree because the little brat asked. Let’s put it on hold and see how he performs first.”

Zhou Milu sulked, having previously promised the other party.

Pei Qian sighed, “Alright, you can tell him I agree, but it’s a significant responsibility. He can’t neglect his duties and must report to me every month. As for any gifts, let’s skip that; he’s just a little pauper.”

Zhou Milu straightened up. “Understood!”

One rider left the capital of the Great Sui, heading south on a journey.

A young woman donned in red, with a narrow knife hanging at her waist and a silver sword-raising gourd.

She gazed up at the sea of clouds above.

In her childhood, a mere glance at the clouds would conjure thoughts that they were fairies dressed in beautiful garments, changing outfits like a parade.

Back then, it seemed every day brought a flurry of such whimsical ideas, akin to a rowdy bunch of mischievous little beings, too many to manage, too wild to contain.

Now, she took down the sword-raising gourd and took a sip.

Li Baoping felt a tinge of sadness.

“Little Master Uncle, after growing up, it seems I’ve lost those thoughts. They’ve all left without a word, never to return.”

After the dual sword cultivators exchanged insights, waves of demon forces began their northern migration to the battlefield.

This time, the commanding beasts of the army were the Lotus Blossom Master and the Golden Armored Deity.

This marked the first time two great demon kings had jointly presided over a military campaign on the battlefield.

The Lotus Blossom Master had refined half of a moon’s essence from the wild and chaotic realm. Previously, on the battlefield, he had a sparring match with Chen Chunan, the scholarly swordsman who journeyed along the Sword Qi Great Wall. No clear victor emerged, but it was evident that the Lotus Blossom Master suffered a slight disadvantage. This was due to the fact that neither side had exerted their full strength, or perhaps the battlefield’s complexity did not allow for such a display.

In the previous four battles, each had been solely managed by a single great demon: Bai Ying, the desiccated bone demon; Yang Zhi, the former master of the Fallen River; Huang Luan, who enjoyed refining structures to build celestial cities; and the bearded man responsible for the Sword Qi Great Wall, Liu Cha, who was both an enemy and ally of Ah Liang. Liu Cha, although less imposing than the others, observed the two sides’ formations from the rear, and after the battle concluded, selected a dozen young sword cultivators as his registered disciples.

Liu Cha’s first disciple, his only true successor, was the sword cultivator Zhu Qi.

These young sword cultivators, who seemed almost dreamlike, were still far from becoming Liu Cha’s direct disciples, facing two significant thresholds: first entering the sect, then entering the inner circle.

Once registered, if a disciple achieved success in their studies and passed the tests, they could be formally admitted. Only then could they enter the master’s inner circle, becoming a direct disciple and gaining access to their mentor’s teachings and lineage.

Even though the path ahead remained distant, the dozen or so of them were filled with excitement, forming a small hill of enthusiasm. 

After all, Liu Cha, the mountain-climbing swordsman, was the pinnacle of the sword path in the wild realm. To become his disciple, even if only temporarily registered, was a source of immense pride.

As for the closed-door disciples, their roles were just as significant as those of the first disciples. Often, the master entrusted them with their life’s work and knowledge, considering them worthy of rest once entrusted. The closed-door disciples were thus barred from outsiders, marking their importance.

Taking a master is akin to being reborn; selecting a disciple is akin to having a child, and for both parties, it is a momentous event.

Before the war broke out, Qi Shou had already entered the Nascent Soul realm, while Gao Ye Hou was on the verge of breaking through. Pang Yuanji, whose aptitude surpassed Gao Ye Hou and whose ultimate achievement was expected to surpass Qi Shou, found his sword heart muddied, his realm unstable—perhaps this is what is called the uncertainty of fate.

The grand battle was magnificent, with minor figures like Fan Dache advancing to the Golden Core stage—truly a small matter, merely a celebration shared among friends with a few drinks during the war’s intermissions.

The demon cultivators returned to the battlefield, continuing their clashes against the sword formations with a torrent of magical treasures.

Yet, the demon sword cultivators refrained from joining the fray, for they were far too precious and reluctant to expend themselves in a siege battle.

If the untransformed demons of the wild realm were akin to the most worthless copper coins, then the awakened and enlightened demon cultivators were like snowflake coins, and those who mastered their hearts could possess spirit artifacts and treasures—those demon sword cultivators were the most cherished and protected.

It was not that continuing to question the Sword Qi Great Wall was meaningless, but rather that with an unending supply of copper coins, similar achievements could be amassed without wasting the precious sword cultivators’ snowflake coins, which were hard to come by.

In the realm of Haoran, such sieges would lead to countless deaths, with the military camps daring to manipulate the lives of ants, sacrificing tens of thousands without a second thought. The resulting corpses would stain the battlefield for eternity. Yet in the wild realm, this was entirely acceptable.

For the first time in the wild realm, an ant swarm siege was observed.

Thereupon, the sound of horns echoed, resounding through the heavens, invigorating the military spirits in the wild realm.

The pure martial artists, the rugged fellows, had long awaited this moment, their fists brimming with intent, finally able to unleash their punches and slay demons.

The sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage continued their strategy of three-person rotations, taking turns to strike from the city walls.

The daily battle losses of both sides were meticulously recorded. Guo Zhujiu was responsible for compiling the records, and the atmosphere in the hall of the Summer Retreat Palace grew increasingly tense. Everyone was busily overwhelmed, and even Guo Zhujiu spent all day at his desk.

On the other side of the Upside-Down Mountain, nearly all the boatmasters engaged in trade had already visited Chunfan Studio at least once.

Yan Ming, Nalan Caihuan, and Mi Yu, along with Shao Yunyan and his direct disciple Wei Wenlong, were also busy.

While the battlefield was one of life and death, the battlefield also existed on the account books.

This was the Sword Qi Great Wall and the Eight Continent Trading Boats attempting to engage in trade through a new method, with numerous small frictions. Moreover, the collection of snowflake coins by the Aiai Continent Trading Boats was not progressing smoothly. The main issue was that the Liu family of the Aiai Continent had yet to express any stance, and since they controlled all the mines and profits related to snowflake coins, their silence and unwillingness to offer discounts hindered progress.

The few intercontinental boats were too hesitant to travel across the continents with snowflake coins; even a single ship’s worth would tempt Fifth Realm cultivators to act, rallying friends to ambush the boats, which could lead to disastrous consequences. Thus, the Aiai Continent Trading Boats dared not take such risks, and the Sword Qi Great Wall did not wish to see such outcomes either. Therefore, when the Aiai Trading Boats returned from their first trip to the Upside-Down Mountain, they didn’t bring any snowflake coins but instead requested various other supplies listed in the original Chunfan Studio account book.

The boatmasters from Aiai, including Jiang Gaotai, proposed that the Sword Qi Great Wall deploy sword immortals to escort the boats, ensuring that they had sword immortals stationed both ways.

Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan felt this was impractical and suggested that the boats hire one or two Fifth Realm cultivators themselves. After all, this snowflake coin business, if successful, would earn the Aiai Trading Boats enough profit without relying on the Sword Qi Great Wall for protection. A round trip could often take six months or even a year, and they could hardly expect a sword immortal to be absent from the Sword Qi Great Wall for such long periods.

Shao Yunyan proposed a compromise: each trading boat didn’t need to stake their entire venture on snowflake coins. The Aiai Continent was rich in resources, with significant profits to be made.

These unexpected twists in such a big business required both sides to negotiate. If any single link went wrong, a transaction could be considered lost.

Chunfan Studio was already experiencing a sweltering summer, with the world’s furnace ablaze, while the Sword Qi Great Wall faced a snowless winter.

This left Guo Zhujiu feeling somewhat regretful. Initially, he had made an agreement with his master to build ten or more snowmen during the snow season, ensuring that all sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage would participate.

The sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage could at least find some comfort in the fact that the significant controversy surrounding the young hidden official’s use of the flying sword “Hidden Official” to send messages to the city walls had subsided. Or perhaps it still lingered, but no one had the time to voice their opinions anymore.

The war was brutal, with too many lives lost.

Even the swordsman Qiumiao, alongside Pang Yuanji and Lin Junbi, could only drag the true body of a soaring realm great demon, seizing a moment during the battle to stroll to the city walls and announce that the great demon was hiding in the Upside-Down Mountain, attempting to incite chaos. They tracked down its roots, decisively teaming up with several sword immortals, including Lu Zhi, to surround and slay it at sea.

Slaying a soaring realm great demon was no trivial matter, and the Sword Qi Great Wall was abuzz with excitement. Countless voices cheered in approval.

In the end, Lin Junbi couldn’t bear to sever its head, instead paying respects to the wild realm and stubbornly deciding to keep the entire true body of the soaring realm great demon, dragging it back to the Summer Retreat Palace.

Upon returning, the young hidden official saw the great demon’s head still attached and grinned from ear to ear, scolding Lin Junbi for being stingy, yet immediately storing the demon’s body in his spatial pouch, heartily patting Lin Junbi’s shoulder, laughing like a child who had just found a treasure.

Gu Yu and Wang Xinshui exchanged glances, knowing that Lin Junbi would surely receive credit from the Hidden Official.

That day, Chen Pingan left the hall of the Summer Retreat Palace for a walk, and Lin Junbi followed closely behind.

Chen Pingan smiled and asked, “Got something on your mind?”

Lin Junbi replied, “Regarding the Eight Continent Trading Boats, progress has been relatively smooth for now, but the largest issue lies not with the buyers and sellers, but with the views of the Haoran Academy.”

Chen Pingan raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “What do you mean?”

Lin Junbi expressed his concerns, “Previously, the Eight Continent Trading Boats operated haphazardly, and the Confucian Temple likely wouldn’t interfere too much. However, now that we’ve changed the situation, the Confucian Temple may have some backlash. To be honest, we have touched upon several fundamental interests of the Haoran realm. For every additional resource sent to the Upside-Down Mountain, Haoran loses that much.”

Chen Pingan nodded. “That’s true.”

Lin Junbi inquired, “If the Confucian Temple orders the Eight Continent Trading Boats to restrict their operations to the Haoran realm and not allow them to travel to the Upside-Down Mountain, what should we do?”

Although Lin Junbi was a sword cultivator, he was skilled in various techniques. He formed a hand sign with his fingers, using talismans and earth techniques to create a floating map of the realm, moving along with them. He pointed to the map, shaping water into new trade routes connecting the continents. “The resources from Central Divine Continent and Aiai Continent Trading Boats should only go to Nan Posa Continent, while Liuxia Continent and Golden Armored Continent support the southwestern Fuyun Continent. The Beiju Continent and Baoping Continent Trading Boats can only head southeast to Tongye Continent, building and fortifying the coastal defenses of these three continents. Even if the prices are lower than the Sword Qi Great Wall by ten to twenty percent, I believe the Eight Continent Trading Boats will comply out of necessity. As for the original trading boats from the three continents, including Posa, they will certainly not come to the Upside-Down Mountain.”

Chen Pingan strolled alongside Lin Junbi. “Regarding the Eight Continent Trading Boats, what you mentioned as the worst-case scenario, the swordsman Qiumiao warned me about this early on. However, there’s no way around it. We can’t let fear of this consequence prevent us from acting. We’ll take it step by step. Every time a trading boat docks at the Upside-Down Mountain, we’ll consider it as gaining more resources. We just hope the Confucian Temple doesn’t rush to a conclusion.”

Lin Junbi asked, “Mr. Confucian, can you really speak on such a significant matter at the Confucian Temple?”

Chen Pingan shook his head. “That’s quite difficult. The Confucians emphasize rank and propriety, stressing that one must have a valid reason for speaking.”

Lin Junbi pressed, “What if you include the scholarly Chen family? Is that not enough?”

Chen Pingan still shook his head. “Each side has its own difficulties.”

Lin Junbi bit his lip. “I’ll write a secret letter to my own master, asking him to say a few words for us?”

Chen Pingan stopped walking and said, “Remember, while you’re in the Sword Qi Great Wall, you’re just Lin Junbi, a sword cultivator. Don’t involve your own scholarly lineage, and definitely don’t drag the Shao Yuan Dynasty into this, because it will not only be of no use but could also backfire on you.”

Chen Pingan smiled. “I appreciate your goodwill.”

In truth, Chen Pingan could easily agree to Lin Junbi’s suggestion, regardless of whether Lin Junbi was acting impulsively or calculating. He could have Lin Junbi write the letter, sending it to the Shao Yuan Dynasty via a flying sword, and then have a sword immortal intercept it midway, allowing Chen Pingan to review the contents before deciding whether to keep the letter, archive it in the Summer Retreat Palace, or send it to the Central Divine Continent.

However, having spent enough time together, Chen Pingan understood Lin Junbi’s character well enough. For the sake of accomplishment, he would go to great lengths to achieve his goals, but Lin Junbi’s ambitions weren’t solely for personal gain; he also sought to stabilize the nation and the world.

With this thought in mind, Chen Pingan decided to be candid with Lin Junbi, suggesting he write the letter, going through the motions and ultimately archiving it in the Hidden Official lineage, hoping to find a chance to subtly inform the Haoran realm of this minor secret.

Perhaps one day in the future, it could serve to benefit Lin Junbi upon his return to the Haoran realm.

Lin Junbi was taken aback for a moment and sighed, “Is it really necessary to do so?”

Chen Pingan smiled. “Good deeds will be rewarded; what’s so strange about it? Ideally, altruism should leave no trace, but since the world is not yet so pure, we’ll settle for a lesser virtue. Isn’t it said that there’s such a thing as ‘lesser masterpieces beneath the true relics’ in literature and art? I think this will do just fine. Junbi, you don’t need to be so troubled about this matter; it’s not the only good deed in the world.”

Lin Junbi pondered for a moment, then nodded readily.

Chen Pingan said, “If the Confucian Temple truly acts this way, it’s not mere personal interest nor prejudice against the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Chen Pingan sighed. “Opening the door to thieves is merely a means to close the door on dogs. To resolve the great hidden danger of the wild realm once and for all, the Confucian Temple has had such thoughts since ancient times. However, discussing this behind closed doors is one thing, but it cannot be spoken of outside; not a word can be leaked. The burden of benevolence is too heavy. The question of which lineage should bear the blame for this act of opening the door to thieves must be addressed. Someone must take the lead and advocate for this matter, right? The records on the Confucian Temple’s side will clearly document everything. Once the door opens, countless lives will suffer, and even if the final outcome is good, what then? How will the conscience of all Confucian disciples weigh against this? Will they not feel heartbroken, deeply disappointed in their lineage’s sages? As a moral sage who serves the Confucian Temple, how could one act with such disregard for lives, akin to a petty opportunist? Will the very lineage of literary tradition and道統 not collapse? When it comes to disputes among lineages, the sages can adhere to the principles of gentlemanly rivalry, but the countless Confucian students, many of whom are only half-hearted scholars, how could they all maintain such high moral standards?”

“Moreover, the bigger trouble lies within the lineage itself, where there are those who only care about their own lineage's honor and disgrace, regardless of right or wrong. In such cases, these individuals will certainly engage in the most vicious debates with outsiders, making matters worse and more wrong. How will the sages settle this? Will they prioritize dealing with external criticisms or suppress the rising discontent among their own disciples? Will they just say, ‘We admit our fault; you all should be quiet and stop criticizing’?”

“Ultimately, aren’t scholars and cultivators just individuals?”

As he spoke, Chen Pingan patted Lin Junbi on the shoulder. “Take your friend, that Mr. Xilu, for instance. Didn’t he gain notoriety for breaking statues and opportunistically seizing the moment? To say he has no knowledge or abilities is hard to believe, considering he could write the ‘Chess Manual of Kuai Zai Pavilion.’ To claim he hasn’t contributed to the literary tradition of the Shao Yuan Dynasty seems unlikely.”

The flattery of certain scholars could be as beautiful as a tapestry, yet they had long since rotted at the root. These individuals, once they set their minds to scheming, could easily ascend to high positions. It wouldn’t be accurate to say they hadn’t done anything; they simply enjoyed a comfortable life without contributing.

The complexity of the world lies in the fact that bad people can do good things, and good people can make mistakes. The merits and demerits of certain actions can vary based on context and individuals.

As the world becomes more aware of the news, able to connect facts into truths and accustomed to doing so, it should gradually improve.

Perhaps that’s what it means for the granaries to be full, leading to knowledge of rites.

Without knowledge, it’s hard not to feel disappointed. With more knowledge, even if disappointment lingers, there remains a glimmer of hope.

What’s truly frightening is when someone, in their despair, destroys the hopes of others.

Chen Pingan smiled and asked, “Lin Junbi, do you genuinely recognize this person?”

Lin Junbi, somewhat put off, fell silent.

Regarding the matter of breaking statues, Lin Junbi didn’t truly endorse it, but he wouldn’t stoop so low as to join the young hidden official in criticizing someone else. That would be beneath him.

Moreover, Lin Junbi found much to appreciate in that Mr. Xilu.

As autumn approached, the air was crisp, and countless bandits had been dealt with.

Today, Guo Zhujiu was flipping through the latest edition of the book, sweating slightly on her forehead.

Her master had once said that whenever the number of battle losses exceeded half among the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage, they would convene to discuss matters.

On this day, someone visited the Summer Retreat Palace, abiding by the rules and waiting outside the door.

The swordsman Ku Xia would temporarily leave the Sword Qi Great Wall for a while, needing to escort Jin Zhenmeng, Yu Jianfu, and Zhu Mei to the Upside-Down Mountain, then send them to the territory of Nan Posa before returning.

Before leaving, Ku Xia brought the three to visit the Summer Retreat Palace, accompanied by three young children—two budding sword cultivators and a rare pure martial artist.

Lin Junbi received special permission from the Hidden Official to go out and see them off.

This showed that Lin Junbi held a somewhat special place in the Hidden Official’s heart.

As he approached the palace gate, Lin Junbi was filled with sentiment. Surely, that Mr. Cui hadn’t anticipated today’s events.

Was it not true that he had risked his life, tying his head to his waistband, just to barely reverse the game that Mr. Cui had left behind, relying on Mr. Cui’s moves to avoid further plays?

Upon reaching the door, Lin Junbi performed a bow, remaining silent, thus bidding them a quiet farewell.

For the first time, Yu Jianfu took the initiative to speak to Lin Junbi.

Yu Jianfu smiled and said, “Lin Junbi, just don’t die. When you return to the Central Divine Continent, you are welcome to visit the Yu family. We have peers of your age who have been skilled at chess since childhood.”

Lin Junbi chuckled, “I sincerely ask Miss Yu not to play matchmaker!”

Yu Jianfu beamed, “We’ll talk when we meet.”

Lin Junbi hesitated for a moment, then stepped back, bowing and apologizing. “I once had some unseemly calculations, and I apologize to Miss Yu here.”

Yu Jianfu laughed, “Your teacher has good taste, but it’s a pity that I’m not capable enough. Lin Junbi, since you’re so candid, then I’ll take the role of matchmaker.”

Indeed. Indeed!

Once again, Mr. Cui had hit the nail on the head.

What a close call.

Don’t be fooled by Yu Jianfu’s seemingly straightforward demeanor; she was actually the direct daughter of the Yu family, which was far from simple.

Yu Jianfu fell silent, rubbing the head of a small girl beside her, who would henceforth become her registered disciple, traveling together to explore the vast Haoran realm!

As for the other two young budding sword cultivators, their talent wasn’t particularly outstanding in the Sword Qi Great Wall but was still commendable within the Haoran realm. After all, which sect would reject sword cultivators? Moreover, to say they weren’t outstanding was only in comparison to prodigies like Qi Shou, Pang Yuanji, Situ Weiran, and Guo Zhujiu. In the Haoran realm, earth-level sword cultivators were still quite rare.

Jin Zhenmeng said, “Junbi, when we reach our hometown, if you don’t mind my abrupt retreat, you still consider me a friend, I’ll come find you for a drink!”

Lin Junbi nodded, “I do have some reservations, but if the wine is indeed good, I’ll hold my nose and drink it before cursing!”

The usually reserved Jin Zhenmeng couldn’t help but burst into laughter, stepping forward to pat Lin Junbi’s shoulder. “The young man before me is the Lin Junbi I hold in high regard! The finest talent of the Shao Yuan Dynasty.”

The swordsman Ku Xia felt quite satisfied.

Zhu Mei was also a bit cheerful, the atmosphere warm and pleasant—things had finally reached this point.

Zhu Mei’s words were succinct. “See you in our hometown, Lin Junbi.”

Lin Junbi smiled and nodded.

Upon entering, Chen Pingan leaned against the shadow wall, sipping wine from his sword-raising gourd, and softly said, “Junbi, if you leave the Sword Qi Great Wall now, you’ve already gained a lot. You haven’t really lost anything, and you could earn even more, but there’s a possibility of suffering many losses as well. Generally speaking, you can leave the gambling table now.”

This white-robed young man from the Central Divine Continent, a talented sword cultivator, had a spark in his eyes. “Bet big, win big!”

Lin Junbi laughed again. “Moreover, I’ve calculated that the Hidden Official won’t let me die at the Sword Qi Great Wall.”

Chen Pingan asked, “Outside, you’re still calculating human hearts, but do you find yourself happier when playing chess with others than before?”

Lin Junbi hummed in agreement.

Chen Pingan whispered, “Don’t lose the skills you had before; just get used to the ways of the outside world a bit. That will be just fine.”

Lin Junbi nodded.

Chen Pingan said, “When you see those with deeper hearts, remember that your own heart is already like a fish in the abyss, a dragon at the bottom of a well. There’s no need to fear this.”

Lin Junbi asked, “Why is that?”

Chen Pingan smiled. “The bright moon is reflected in the water. As long as you are willing to open your eyes to see, it will come into view, within reach.”

Lin Junbi hesitated for a moment but still chose to be honest. “Hidden Official, have you seen Yan Lyu and Jiang Guancheng? Do you find them irritating?”

Chen Pingan replied, “Aren’t they still with Yu Jianfu and Zhu Mei? Besides, the vast majority are those who are unwilling or unable to speak.”

Lin Junbi asked, “Hidden Official, when will you head to the battlefield?”

Chen Pingan smiled. “Even if I go, it can only be sneakily.”

Then Lin Junbi saw the young hidden official make a strange gesture, raising his hands to smooth his hair.

Lin Junbi didn’t dare to ask more, looking around, and saw no sign of that lady. Mi Yu and Gu Yu were the same; it was normal. However, seeing the young hidden official act like this was a bit odd.

Chen Pingan glanced at the sky and said, “I’m waiting for someone. He’s a swordsman.”

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 759: At the City Gates

On Luhua Island, the legendary Creation Cave, known for being a place where high-level cultivators practice their immortal techniques, witnessed a dramatic confrontation. A powerful demon, on the verge of ascension to the Immortal Realm, faced off against the swordsman known as Zuo You. After probing the enemy's strengths and weaknesses with a blade, Zuo You unleashed another strike, forcing the demon to retreat from Luhua Island. Ultimately, the demon met its demise at sea, cut down by Zuo You.

Upon landing, Zuo You and Wang Shizi of the Sword Sect sent two flying swords as messages to Chuanfan Hall in the Upside Down Mountain, detailing the encounter for the Jin Dan sword cultivators heading to Tongyezhou.

Wang Shizi, a Jin Dan sword cultivator, could only observe the battle from a distance. Though his cultivation was not high, he had seen many formidable demons in the Sword Qi Great Wall battles, allowing him to recognize that this demon from the Creation Cave was no ordinary adversary.

Even from nearly three hundred miles away, with the turbulent waves crashing like thunder below him, Wang Shizi could still clearly sense the ripples of sword intent emanating from Zuo You’s clash with the demon.

After sheathing his sword, Zuo You approached Wang Shizi, briefly relaying what had transpired before they continued their journey. Unable to contain his curiosity, Wang Shizi asked the silent sword immortal beside him, "Elder, do you think that demon has already ascended?"

Zuo You shook his head. "Not yet, but it is close. If we had arrived at Luhua Island any later, it would have been just a few years—at most ten—before that demon emerged as a true ascendant, and that would be troublesome."

Zuo You added, "But if we meet again in three to five years, and I am unscathed, it wouldn’t be too much of a problem."

Zuo You was not one for many words; when he spoke, he was direct and never exaggerated, nor did he need to feign humility. 

Regarding the message sent by the Sword Sect’s flying swords, it was simple: "On this trip to Tongyezhou, I encountered and eliminated a demon at the Immortal Realm, leaving no trace behind. The credit goes to my junior, Chen Ping’an."

If only Chuanfan Hall and the Sword Qi Great Wall received a message from Zuo You alone, they might have dismissed it as merely an encounter with an ordinary demon at the Immortal Realm.

At Chuanfan Hall, Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan were initially shocked, before exchanging smiles. "As expected of Zuo You," they mused.

Wei Wenlong was left puzzled by the situation.

Mi Yu chuckled and said, "Wenlong, my friend."

Wei Wenlong felt a chill run down his spine and looked up, "What guidance do you have, Mi Sword Immortal?"

Mi Yu asked, "Do you know who Zuo You's junior brother is?"

Wei Wenlong guessed, "It must be the Hidden Official."

Though his cultivation was not high, he was clever enough.

Mi Yu looked at him with amusement.

Wei Wenlong quickly added, "Right?"

Mi Yu nodded with a smile. "Not bad—seems like you are indeed a talent favored by the Hidden Official. Wenlong, is there a girl you fancy but can’t have? Do you need me to share some tips? Don’t worry, it’s not anything unorthodox; I’m completely sincere."

Wei Wenlong hastily shook his head.

Even if there were such a girl, he would never dare let Mi Yu know.

With his fan in hand, Mi Yu asked, "If a girl who previously liked you suddenly turned her affections to me, would that still be someone worth pursuing?"

Wei Wenlong felt a bit distressed.

Nalan Caihuan, fed up with Mi Yu's antics, snapped, "What’s there to show off with such a repulsive facade?"

Mi Yu gracefully closed his fan. "Everyone has a love for beauty. If the women of the world meet Mi Yu and find me even slightly off-putting, that’s the only thing I can do."

Nalan Caihuan scoffed, "I find you extremely off-putting."

Mi Yu opened the fan again, hiding his face, "I’m willing to do more for Miss Nalan."

Wei Wenlong was taken aback by the exchange.

On Mount Chui Shang, the ancestral mountain of the Sword Sect, the sect leader Ji Hai had originally rejected Zhong Kui's proposal regarding a unique secret technique—it was Ji Hai's fundamental path, meant to be passed down exclusively to the successor of the sect leader. Moreover, Ji Hai had already set his sights on the next sect leader, a young man who had inadvertently exposed a hidden demon years ago. This boy had a special connection with the Sword Sect, as the ties of cultivation were paramount.

Ji Hai intended to formally accept this boy as his close disciple upon his return from studying at the Great Fulu Academy. The fact that he had not yet paid respects in the Ancestor Hall meant he wasn't Ji Hai's true close disciple yet.

Zhong Kui knew that relying solely on letters from the academy's teachers and the old heavenly lord of Taiping wouldn't convince Ji Hai to make an exception. It was also a matter of principle; he truly shouldn’t be so demanding. Only compelled by his master’s orders, Zhong Kui remained persistent, visiting Ji Hai for tea and conversation, to which Ji Hai eventually had to retreat behind closed doors. As a result, Zhong Kui set up a few tables outside the sacred cave of the Sword Sect, surrounded by books, claiming he was there to guard the place while reading daily.

Ji Hai ignored him.

Other matters could be discussed, but this issue was non-negotiable. Not even the old sect master of Yuguizong, Xun Yuan, or the new sect master, Jiang Shangzhen, could sway Ji Hai on this matter.

Huang Ting lacked Zhong Kui's audacity and left the mountain to travel.

For some unknown reason, the once-anxious master, Song Mao, and the old heavenly lord now encouraged her to take her time with breaking through her Nascent Soul bottleneck, emphasizing the importance of going with the flow. The old heavenly lord even gave a long lecture filled with absurd reasoning, ending with, "A woman of such high cultivation will find it hard to find a man."

While Zhong Kui was trying to outlast Ji Hai, Zuo You and Wang Shizi journeyed from the sea to the Sword Sect, prompting Ji Hai to finally exit his seclusion.

Upon hearing Wang Shizi's report about Zuo You slaying a major demon at the Immortal Realm and sending a message via flying sword to the Upside Down Mountain, Ji Hai, as a sect leader, had a greatly favorable impression of Zuo You, the one who had single-handedly weakened the Tongye Sect. In fact, Ji Hai viewed Zuo You as a benefactor.

Ji Hai, who harbored a deep hatred for demons due to the death of his partner at the hands of one, was particularly invested in this matter. Years ago, a demon had fled from him after he was severely injured, preventing him from pursuing it further. Three others, including the Taiping Mountain’s master, Song Mao, and the then-ancestor of the Tongye Sect, pursued the demon but ultimately failed. Coincidentally, that demon encountered Zuo You at sea, and according to Jiang Shangzhen, the demon inexplicably deemed Zuo You a nuisance and refused to avoid him, resulting in its untimely demise.

Now that Zuo You had landed with news of yet another demon's death, Ji Hai could not help but feel elated.

However, Zuo You remained indifferent to the overly enthusiastic sect leader. His impression of Tongyezhou was only mildly positive, primarily due to Taiping Mountain. 

Before descending the mountain, Zuo You casually remarked to Zhong Kui, "Are you planning to keep that little snow pick I lent you, hoping to get away with it?"

Zhong Kui nearly burst into tears on the spot. The matter of whether to return it was secondary; the key was that he had established a connection with this sword immortal—Zuo You was essentially his senior brother now. 

How could there be a more reasonable situation than this?

Feeling aggrieved, Zhong Kui began sharing his dismal experiences at the Sword Sect, detailing how he was looked down upon and often denied access...

Ji Hai’s face turned dark with anger; any guilt he felt was swiftly erased.

Zuo You pondered for a moment before telepathically inquiring about Zhong Kui and Ji Hai, ultimately suggesting, "Ji Hai, you could have Zhong Kui swear that this secret technique will not be passed to outsiders. Since he is no longer a Confucian disciple, he can serve as an honorary member of the Sword Sect. But I’m just an outsider, merely making a suggestion."

Ji Hai sighed and surprisingly nodded in agreement.

Zhong Kui had no objections either.

Ji Hai personally escorted Zuo You and Zhong Kui to the mountain gate. Zhong Kui couldn’t help but recall his previous ascent with Huang Ting—it was a stark contrast.

Zuo You happened to be heading to Taiping Mountain alongside Zhong Kui.

Curious, Zhong Kui asked, "Elder, how did you become Chen Ping’an's senior brother?"

Zuo You chuckled, "My master forced him upon me, so I begrudgingly accepted."

Zhong Kui was left speechless.

Even a kitchen knife, after chopping vegetables and meats for an extended period, would become dull over time. 

A dull knife needs sharpening.

But in the wild world, where battles come in relentless waves, the most vital aspect was to ensure that the sword immortals at the city gates had no chance to hone their skills. If they wanted to take a moment to rest and recover their swords, it would require the lives and flying swords of mid-tier Jin Dan cultivators in exchange.

In the past, siege battles in the wild were chaotic and sporadic, full of unforeseen events. The mobilization of troops on the battlefield, the arrival of reinforcements, and the individual assaults often broke the continuity, leading to prolonged lulls of months, or even half a year. When one side had their turn basking in the sun, the other would have their turn under the moonlight. During the outbreak of war, the battlefield would be exceptionally brutal, with blood and flesh flying, flying swords shattering—especially during the sudden clashes between large demons and sword immortals, which were astonishing yet could determine the fate of a battlefield or even the entire war.

Yet, there had never been a war so suffocating as the current one.

It felt as if no one could decisively determine the outcome. The demons showcased their various abilities, while the sword immortals struck fiercely, yet no one could seal the fate, and life and death became lost in the chaos of the battlefield.

The most intense battle, the most breathtaking slaughter, occurred when a major demon shifted the Five Mountains onto the battlefield. The demon lord took command, and the three sword immortals—Li Tui Mi, Chen Xi, and Zhong Kui—sacrificed themselves to break the deadlock. Zuo You later entered the fray, and amidst the concealed demons, the old sword immortal Dong San withdrew from the city gates to assist Zuo You, who ultimately fell into a trap laid by the Hidden Official Xiao Xian and was severely injured, marking the end of that encounter.

In the wild world, the sixty military tents continuously supplied reinforcements in phases, and the siege was executed seamlessly. The wild world clearly aimed to deny the Sword Qi Great Wall any chance to recover, especially to the upper-tier Jin Dan sword immortals. In this severe and pressurized situation, the initial constraints that made the sword immortals feel restricted in their strikes began to show their effects.

Previously, on the city gates, the overwhelming strength of individual sword immortals, their extraordinary prowess, had been diluted by the necessity of sacrifice, resulting in a greater collective strength for the sword formation.

Now, when a sword immortal would leave the battlefield to recuperate, the disadvantages would lessen.

The Hidden Official’s research into the sword formations had deepened. Not only were upper-tier Jin Dan sword immortals familiar with each other’s flying swords and divine abilities, but they also had become exceedingly well-acquainted with the flying swords of lower-tier cultivators.

Military strategies are fluid; soldiers have no fixed tactics. The sword cultivators on the city gates constantly adjusted their formations, changing defensive positions with many unfamiliar sword immortals they had never met before, collaborating in pairs with flying swords, even forming formations of dozens of flying swords, stacking their divine abilities. If they could endure the initial phase of adaptation, their power would dramatically increase.

Currently, there were as many as thirty-one sword formations in the Sword Qi Great Wall, crafted from the five elemental flying swords and divine abilities.

In the past, the Sword Qi Great Wall resembled a wealthy household, with its wealth of gold, silver, and fertile lands, likely unaware of its true fortune.

Now, the Sword Qi Great Wall was reduced to a single copper coin in the corner, to be picked up and noted down.

Thanks to this situation, every Hidden Official was an indispensable presence.

Among them, the contributions of the sword immortals—especially the deep understanding of flying swords and divine abilities by Chou Miao, the strategic vision of Lin Junbi, and Guo Zhujiu's flashes of inspiration—were the most significant.

However, during this time, there were still flaws and mistakes in the deployment of the Hidden Official’s forces, which required the sword cultivators on the battlefield to compensate with their lives and flying swords.

The sword immortals of the Hidden Official line also experienced significant arguments and grievances, as on a small battlefield, conflicting strategies often arose. Before the outcome was clear, no one could confidently declare which plan was superior. If the battlefield developed as expected, it would be manageable. But once problems arose, it would become troublesome—if one side was wrong, they would feel guilt, and if they were right, they would feel frustration.

The most heated argument occurred between Xu Ning and Cao Gun, where both nearly resorted to swordplay.

A proposal from the Summer Palace led to the death of two earth immortal sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall, along with thirty-one mid-tier Jin Dan cultivators, all perishing with their swords shattered.

Everyone felt heartbroken. Xuan Can, who was responsible for drafting the plan, was filled with regret. Although Xu Ning initially only expressed dissatisfaction, it only fueled the fire, and Xuan Can, feeling guilty, did not retort. Cao Gun, who had a good relationship with Xuan Can, couldn’t hold back and directly scolded Xu Ning, telling him to keep his mouth clean. 

Xu Ning replied by cursing Xuan Can’s ancestors.

Xuan Can was a skilled strategist in chess; otherwise, he wouldn’t often play against Lin Junbi and have moments of victory. His insults were sharp, leaving Xu Ning’s face pale and ready for a duel.

The atmosphere in the hall grew tense, and any duel would mean that for the Hidden Official line, there would be no true winner.

Luo Zhenyi remarked, "If Xu Ning’s proposal had been adopted initially, would we have suffered such heavy losses? If I remember correctly, it was rejected by you, so how is Xu Ning being the wise one after the fact?"

Chang Taiqing, a close friend of Xu Ning, weighed in with even harsher words, calling it foolish to not recognize one’s mistakes.

The foreign sword cultivator Song Gaoyuan, usually close to Luo Zhenyi, clearly sided with Cao Gun and Xuan Can, leading to an argument with Chang Taiqing.

Lin Junbi attempted to mediate but ended up displeasing both sides. He had to scold Xu Ning and Xuan Can, with the blame shifting to him.

Guo Zhujiu, unaccustomed to such a scene, found himself at a loss, as everything he said or did seemed wrong.

If not for Chen Ping’an and Chou Miao holding their ground, the local sword cultivators and foreign sword cultivators would have nearly torn apart their alliance.

After exchanging glances, Chou Miao, the sword immortal, urged Xu Ning to quiet down.

Then Chen Ping’an spoke, asking whether they wanted to reason or vent their emotions. If they wanted to reason, there was no need; the massive losses were the fault of the entire Hidden Official line, and everyone shared responsibility. He himself bore the greatest fault, as he set the rules, and every proposal was made accordingly. 

After the fact, holding someone accountable was acceptable, but it should not be aimed at any individual. The Hidden Official line was too small to handle that kind of blame game.

If anyone was simply angry and needed to vent through insults, that was fine too—a proper duel could resolve things. Three against three: Deng Liang against Luo Zhenyi, Cao Gun against Chang Taiqing, and Xuan Can against Xu Ning; it could be seen as a long-overdue trial. However, he'd have to note down the exploits of the sword immortals afterward.

The hall fell silent.

Only then did Chen Ping’an, alongside Chou Miao and Lin Junbi, begin to review and analyze the pros and cons of Cao Gun’s plan, not dismissing it outright due to the poor outcome.

At this juncture, most sword cultivators calmed down.

Chen Ping’an finally concluded, "Everyone here is extremely intelligent, and each has their own strengths."

"So those present must be more diligent in their work and principled in their conduct. I trust Xu Ning’s initial words were not malicious; I don’t even think it was inappropriate to say them. On the contrary, it must be made clear that Xuan Can should understand that making mistakes does not grant one immunity just because the intent was good."

"If it was wrong, it won’t change just because we are colleagues under the Hidden Official line. On the contrary, it’s precisely because we are friends that we can scold each other privately. We have been part of the Hidden Official line for over a year, and we know each other’s characters well. It’s easy to call out mistakes and insult each other, isn’t it? Don’t we all understand this?"

Chou Miao then stated, "What truly needs to be addressed isn’t Xu Ning and Xuan Can but rather Cao Gun and Luo Zhenyi’s respective defenses. Is it necessary to muddy the waters to appear loyal?"

Chen Ping’an chuckled, "If it weren’t for the sword goddess Chou Miao overseeing this, you all would have nearly beaten each other to death, wouldn’t you? I foresaw it; three of you went up the city to kill demons, separating you all. If not, by tomorrow, one of you would be missing, and in less than half a year, the Summer Palace would lose half its members. Each empty desk would require a single incense burner and three sticks of incense, and the costs would fall on whose shoulders? A fine Summer Palace would turn into a mourning hall. Should I scold you for being prodigal or miss your hard work and contributions?"

Here it comes, the Hidden Official’s signature sarcasm.

Chou Miao remarked, "Still, the Hidden Official is willing to take on the greatest blame."

Chen Ping’an turned to Gu Jianlong, but he didn’t receive the fair words he sought. Gu Jianlong silently turned to Wang Xinshui, who refused to take the burden and instead looked at Guo Zhujiu, who had her head buried in the records.

Chen Ping’an had no choice but to flip open a record book dedicated to documenting the merits and demerits of the Hidden Official line, preparing to write.

Moments later, Chou Miao asked, "Xu Ning and Luo Zhenyi have written their parts, Cao Gun and Xuan Can have too. Why don’t I see the words 'Hidden Official' or 'Chen Ping’an' anywhere?"

Chen Ping’an chuckled, "Chou Miao, shall we make a bet? Let’s wager whether I wrote down my own faults in this record."

Chou Miao nodded, "I’m in."

Chen Ping’an clapped his hands on the table, "Anyone can bet."

Except for Guo Zhujiu, everyone else followed Chou Miao in betting that the Hidden Official had not written anything down. Just a small wager with a few small coins.

In the end, Chen Ping’an flipped back a page and held up the book, smiling widely, "Everyone, open your eyes wide and see! Cash, cash!"

Guo Zhujiu leaped up, "Collecting money, collecting money!"

All the losers looked at Chou Miao.

Chou Miao looked resigned and turned to Chen Ping’an, smiling wryly, "I didn't expect to lose my reputation; then the split can't be four to six. It has to be fifty-fifty."

Chen Ping’an retorted, "Chou Miao, you’re not my accomplice!"

Gu Jianlong timidly added, "Hidden Official, allow me to speak fairly. The division of wealth is clear; this feels somewhat unfair."

Wang Xinshui nodded, "Your angry expression looks overly dramatic; it's gone too far."

Guo Zhujiu sighed.

Her master was indeed working hard to earn some private funds.

Chen Ping’an suddenly glanced at the scroll on the ground, speaking in a solemn tone, "We need to prepare for the sword immortals to leave the city gate and help separate the battlefield."

Chen Ping’an stood up, "In the previous few instances when I had the chance to head to the city gate, I gave those opportunities to you, considering the future. So now, I have about twenty days to leave the Summer Palace and venture out to kill demons. During this time, Chou Miao and Lin Junbi will oversee the situation. If something truly difficult arises, you can send a flying sword under the name of the 'Hidden Official' to the city gate’s sword immortal Wei Jin, and he will notify me to return here for discussions."

Luo Zhenyi hesitated for a moment, wanting to counsel this young Hidden Official against acting impulsively.

She had to admit that as the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official line grew more coordinated, Chen Ping’an's presence at the Summer Palace might not significantly alter the overall situation. But having him there would make a difference; at the very least, unnecessary arguments would decrease.

Unexpectedly, Chou Miao communicated with Luo Zhenyi through thought, "Let him go; the one who feels the most pent-up is not us. A person who has been emotionless for over a year is not easy."

Luo Zhenyi came to a realization; if not for Chou Miao’s reminder, she wouldn’t have considered this matter.

Chen Ping’an stood up and walked out of the hall. In the courtyard, he donned an old man's mask, strapped on a sword from the sword forge, and wore an extra robe from the clothing shop.

Gu Jianlong quietly reminded him, "Hidden Official, actually wearing the other mask would conceal you better."

Chen Ping’an turned with a smile, his posture slightly hunched, a natural aging quality. In a hoarse voice, he said, "You’re quite the smooth talker. When I return, we shall have a good chat."

Before Gu Jianlong could say anything further, Chen Ping’an's sword leaped from its sheath, and with a light leap, he stood atop the sword, soaring away.

Inside the hall, everyone exchanged glances.

He didn’t seem like a disguised sword cultivator at all.

In the Summer Palace, aside from the young Hidden Official, everyone was a sword cultivator, and they were all talented; they had enough insight to see through the disguise.

Chou Miao chuckled, "Come on, let’s bet whether the Hidden Official is truly a sword cultivator. This time, I’ll take the lead."

Then Chou Miao immediately added, "Guo Zhujiu, you’re not allowed to bet."

Otherwise, not only would there be no profit, but she would undoubtedly lose a fortune, possibly even to the point of financial ruin. This girl had quite the wealth, to say the least.

Just as Guo Zhujiu was about to stake all her possessions, she glared, "On what grounds?!"

As a result, not only Cao Gun’s group, but even Luo Zhenyi, Xu Ning, and Chang Taiqing also placed bets that Chen Ping’an was indeed a sword cultivator.

Chou Miao waved her hand, "What are you all betting for? You’re all young and your cultivations are poor, not focusing on your proper work. Hurry up and get to work! Guo Zhujiu, put everything back in the bamboo box!"

Guo Zhujiu rolled her eyes.

With no accomplices, how could she take the lead? Her master had once said that a gambling table should have ten people, including the dealer, at least eight should be accomplices to make it viable.

After Guo Zhujiu gathered her things, she looked around, ultimately unwillingly seeking out the highest-ranked, albeit somewhat dim-witted, sword immortal Chou Miao to ask, "Chou Miao, will my master be alright?"

Chou Miao smiled, "Don’t worry."

The other sword cultivators wore peculiar expressions.

Gu Jianlong remarked, "Whether the Hidden Official is fine or not, I only know that anyone targeted by your master is bound to face trouble." 

Wang Xinshui nodded, "What Gu said resonates with me."

Soon, the group fell silent.

A significant incident unfolded on the scroll.

On the battlefield, many demons would casually intervene while observing the fight.

This time, it was the demon Bai Ying, seated on the Throne of Bones, who unleashed a technique that was exceedingly brazen. In an instant, tens of thousands of skeleton puppets arose near the city wall, attempting to assist the army in their siege. Although these lifeless bones, lacking intelligence, were far weaker in this form than in life, the sudden surge of numbers on the frontline posed a challenge for the sword cultivators guarding the city.

Before these skeleton puppets could swarm the city wall, Wu Chengpei, a sword immortal at the Jade Purity Realm, summoned his divine flying sword, "Guanlin."

Upon manifesting, whenever blood soaked the earth, rainwater would rise from the ground, collecting towards the sky, creating a torrential downpour that seemed to invert heaven and earth, with only Wu Chengpei's sword intent rain descending normally.

After a deluge, the skeletal puppets and the nearby demon army were nearly annihilated.

Following this, Wu Chengpei repeatedly activated his divine sword, pushing out from the base of the wall. After five successive downpours, only a mere ten percent of those who survived were high-ranking demon cultivators or those with exceptionally tough natural bodies yet to take on human form. These beings then became targets for the sword cultivators atop the city.

Thus, the momentum of the wild world's siege began to wane.

Wu Chengpei then returned his sword, quietly shifting to another section of the wall to continue refining his sword.

It was hard to imagine that this was merely the action of a Jade Purity Realm sword immortal.

An older sword cultivator, stealthily climbing up the city gates, witnessed this scene up close.

Soon after, several sword immortals collectively entered the battlefield, stirring admiration.

Dong Sangeng, Chen Xi, and Qi Tingji, three old sword immortals inscribed on the city wall, also began to mobilize.

Alongside them were the likes of Lu Zhi, Nalan Shaowei, Yue Qing, Yao Lianyun, and Mi Hu, all of whom departed from the city gates.

Additionally, female sword immortals like Zhou Cheng, Yuan Qingshu, and Tao Wen followed suit without exception.

The three sages of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism, stationed at the Sword Qi Great Wall, also began to employ their divine abilities to alter the battlefield.

Thus, the front lines where the sword immortals entrenched themselves became increasingly critical.

On the front line of the sword immortals, the ground swelled like a rolling river, created by the Daoist sage wielding a whisk, with golden characters forming two banks along the riverbanks. In the water floated golden lotuses.

The old sword cultivator followed the mid-tier Jin Dan sword cultivators, departing the city gates in a grand procession.

Once they landed, the old sword cultivator did not dare to charge to the frontlines. Though he held a sword in hand, he summoned a flying sword that circled around him. Seeing the surrounding sword immortals wielding their flying swords with boldness, he felt a twinge of guilt and guided his flying sword to stab a near-death demon, earning a glare from a nearby ocean-seeing sword cultivator, who cursed him, before he continued to stab at other half-dead demons. On the battlefield, it was only by defeating opponents that one could earn merits.

Although the demon army was numerous, the number of cultivators was relatively small, making it difficult to obtain any valuable achievements—losing out on some valuable merits, the old sword cultivator grumbled.

After a few exchanges, the old sword cultivator managed to claim several achievements from the weakened demons, laughing heartily. The nearby ocean-seeing sword cultivator scolded, "Get away from me!"

The old sword cultivator retorted, "I refuse!"

On the frontline, a demon with a Dragon Gate Realm cultivation had been intentionally revealing its true form, and as the ocean-seeing sword cultivator and the old sword cultivator quarreled, it suddenly charged forward, transforming into human form, aiming to crush the ocean-seeing sword cultivator's head with a palm.

However, the young ocean-seeing sword cultivator was no novice; he remained focused, quickly wielding his flying sword towards the demon’s forehead. The demon's rough skin and robust physique allowed it to grab the sword even as it pierced through, but it was determined to smash the sword cultivator's head with its palm.

The ocean-seeing sword cultivator also had a long sword, and as he waved it, he didn’t expect the incoming Dragon Gate Realm demon to suddenly sidestep and reach him at an even quicker pace, swinging its arm to decapitate him.

An old sword cultivator inexplicably appeared between the two, using two fingers to block the demon’s arm, after which the ocean-seeing sword cultivator pierced the demon's head with his flying sword.

The old sword cultivator immediately turned to curse, "You’re stealing my kill! This is a major demon…"

The sword cultivator who had been about to thank the old man stifled the words in his throat, cursing inwardly, "Demon, you bastard."

The old sword cultivator, however, was undeterred and followed him.

The two formed an unlikely partnership, fighting side by side through numerous dangers, yet each time emerging unscathed. When the ocean-seeing sword cultivator finally felt compelled to sincerely thank the old man, he found that the old sword cultivator had vanished.

He glanced back, noticing that the old sword cultivator had taken a brutal punch from a Jin Dan demon, sent flying and rolling in the dirt. Once he stood up, he saw the Jin Dan demon being overwhelmed by sword cultivators and staggeringly fled.

The ocean-seeing sword cultivator couldn’t help but feel puzzled; if this was truly an elder of the Nascent Soul or Jin Dan Realm, such shamelessness was somewhat typical in the Sword Qi Great Wall, yet among them, there were far fewer who were known, and one was more renowned than the next—like the one who would suddenly recite poetry after drinking from the bamboo sea cave’s wine, a notable figure among the elders. But this old man seemed unfamiliar.

The old sword cultivator wandered around, occasionally claiming small advantages. Eventually, he encountered a Jin Dan demon, who had been pursuing him for over a hundred yards. The old sword cultivator summoned another flying sword that bore a striking resemblance to his own, dodging the demon’s ferocious attacks while shouting, "You’d better not make me go all out! I have plenty of flying swords!"

The Jin Dan demon, enraged, seemed to attack recklessly, but was about to summon a powerful offensive treasure when it paused, taken aback by the old sword cultivator's words in the wild world’s grand language, "Quickly put away one of those flying swords and strive to survive to deliver the message."

The Jin Dan demon, though suspicious, decided to grab the old sword cultivator first. Just as it reached for the flying sword, it suddenly accelerated, piercing through the demon's head and destroying one of its eyes.

The Jin Dan demon screamed in agony, revealing its true form and attempting to summon its offensive treasure while shouting for its nearby demon forces to gather and surround the old sword cultivator.

However, the old sword cultivator had already vanished.

Once the demon revealed its true form and gathered around seventy to eighty demons, they found themselves targeted by several sword cultivators.

Far from this battlefield, a young sword cultivator was knocked aside, crashing into the ground, while a demon's treasure smashed into a large pit beside him. In the next moment, an old sword cultivator caught the young man, just as the surrounding demons began their encirclement.

With a sword on his back, the old sword cultivator neither drew his long sword nor summoned a flying sword. Instead, he merely pushed the young cultivator away, sending him far from the battlefield.

Then, the old sword cultivator casually assumed a boxing stance, scattering his intent, and the surroundings were reduced to powder.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 760: The Quest for the Golden Elixir

Upon witnessing this scene, the young sword cultivator was still in shock when the old sword cultivator had already withdrawn his fist stance, standing elegantly with one hand behind his back. He stroked his beard and chuckled, filled with self-satisfaction as he proclaimed, “Truly, my sword energy is invincible.”

The young sword cultivator remained dumbfounded for quite some time. The battlefield was now deserted; in the distance, some demon clansmen, sensing the imminent danger, despite their limited intelligence, understood the peril and quickly took a detour to flee to safer grounds.

The old sword cultivator surveyed the battlefield, noting that several low-ranked demon cultivators had been obliterated, their weapons and souls completely shattered without a trace—such a waste. He made a mental note to be more careful next time; even a mosquito's leg is still meat.

The young sword cultivator swooped down beside the old one, “Old senior?”

With a hoarse voice, the old sword cultivator smiled and replied, “Just call me Sword Immortal Senior. I’m not that old; I can’t bear the title ‘old’.”

The young sword cultivator was speechless, taken aback.

The old sword cultivator had already mounted his sword and soared away, his long sword gliding close to the ground as he swiftly navigated the battlefield like a fish swimming through water plants. He targeted the demon cultivators, killing when possible and wounding when not. His timing for each strike was impeccable, ensuring he wouldn’t interfere with the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The young sword cultivator glanced at the figure of his “Sword Immortal Senior” and the way he wielded his sword, unable to discern the depth of his cultivation. Suppressing his curiosity, he gripped his sword and headed south toward the next battlefield.

In this sortie from the city, the Sword Qi Great Wall dispatched over six thousand mid-ranked sword cultivators. While that sounds like a significant number, in reality, it’s still a treacherous situation for everyone, given the vast expanse of the battlefield. Additionally, the numerous cave-dwelling and sea-watching sword cultivators were primarily there to hone their sword skills and familiarize themselves with the battlefield. They had to balance both killing demons and practicing their swordplay, necessitating the care of higher-ranked fellow sword cultivators. According to the rules of the Hidden Officials lineage, these cultivators sought to survive first, break through their realms second, and only then pursue killing demons. As for the highest-ranked Earth Immortal sword cultivators, their primary mission was to slay demons and secure the lives of the cave-dwelling and sea-watching cultivators as their secondary concern.

With sword cultivators stationed on the city walls, as long as the north-south front didn’t collapse too much, there was no need to worry about demons bypassing the sword cultivators to reach the city.

The sword cultivators of the Dragon Gate realm, positioned between the two extremes, were relatively straightforward, able to take on demons alone or team up with friends without much restriction.

During this time, many small groups of sword cultivators had formed, particularly unique ones where their flying swords’ innate abilities could synergize. As they ventured out to confront the enemy, they aimed to utilize their flying swords in a coordinated manner on the battlefield. For these sword cultivators protecting a certain Golden Elixir or Nascent Soul sword cultivator, their primary duty was to safeguard the former, while slaying demons was secondary. If the former's life path or flying sword were damaged, the Earth Immortal sword cultivators would incur severe penalties. Attempting to make up for it with military merits would be extremely unprofitable.

Once they left the city, the emergency regulations set by the Hidden Officials lineage were few, making each one particularly significant to the sword cultivators.

The old sword cultivator passed through a battlefield far from the city walls, where the fighting was especially brutal.

The fact that they had managed to eliminate all demons near the city walls and pushed southward for dozens of miles indicated that this group of sword cultivators possessed considerable killing power and an even greater thirst for battle.

However, the seven sword cultivators present were now trapped in a dire situation, surrounded by dozens of demon cultivators, with their forces numbering in the thousands, three of which were formidable Golden Elixir “great demons.”

The old sword cultivator recognized two familiar faces: Ren Yi, a Dragon Gate sword cultivator, and Pu Yu, a Golden Elixir sword cultivator. They were among those stationed at the three checkpoints on the main street. The old sword cultivator glanced at Pu Yu and sighed; this young man still had that eye-catching appearance that screamed ‘trouble.’

It was fortunate that this handsome young master wasn’t one of his own; otherwise, he would’ve berated him thoroughly. It was one thing to drink and spar with others in the city, but on the battlefield, to flaunt such an ethereal demeanor was inappropriate. That clothing from the tailor's didn’t cost him half a snowflake; why not drape on an extra piece? If not for the rule allowing each sword cultivator only one free garment, the old sword cultivator could have donned several and carried several more swords into battle.

This old sword cultivator, affectionately referred to as “Sword Immortal Senior,” was none other than the now infamous Hidden Official.

Following the titles of “Fair Merchant” and “One Punch to Defeat Chen Pingan,” he had now acquired another nickname, “The Hidden Official Who Looks Away from Death.”

On the city walls, after the earlier “betrayal” by the sword immortal Lian Ji, the Hidden Official’s lineage of sword cultivators had relocated to their domain. After a prolonged silence, the flying sword inscribed with the words “Hidden Official” transmitted a message to the city walls. Almost all sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall had already sensed what was happening. After all, during the demon clan's onslaught with a torrent of magical treasures and the two great battles against the sword cultivators of the savage world, the waterfall of sword energy on the city walls had undergone numerous formations, killing many Nascent Soul demon cultivators. After a series of these occurrences, the sword cultivators had pieced together the flavor of that wine shop.

Had it not been for the peak great demon’s ruthless slaughter of the sword immortal and the Hidden Official’s efforts to block the rescue, that young outsider, who had once been the second shopkeeper and then the Hidden Official, would have seen his reputation shift from extremely poor to extremely good within the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Pingan wasn’t in a hurry to intervene; Pu Yu, as a Golden Elixir sword cultivator, was likely the protective sword master for this group of young sword cultivators. Ren Yi, being a Dragon Gate cultivator who could move freely on the battlefield, was probably aiming to join forces with Pu Yu to break the encirclement, providing mutual support while also killing more demons. Pu Yu’s innate flying sword, “Rain Mist,” was particularly good at creating illusions, easily misdirecting foes with its swift transformations and decent killing power.

Chen Pingan carefully observed the battlefield and felt no urgency; he assumed a posture of wanting to step in yet lacking the confidence to do so. He made several detours, cutting off some demons trying to bypass the entire battlefield and rush toward the city walls. After all, as long as the demon cultivators could reach the city walls, it would count as an accomplishment. If they could even ascend the walls, it would be a significant achievement, even if they ultimately died without any spoils. Both types of accomplishments would be recorded in the military accounts of the savage world and rewarded to their clans or direct descendants.

What Chen Pingan focused on was an inconspicuous demon cultivator. It wasn’t because the opponent leaked the aura of a great demon; instead, it was an instinctive feeling of “obstruction,” coupled with an unreasonable conviction of having the upper hand in this small battlefield, feeling invulnerable despite the impending danger. This demon cultivator, currently unaware of his own cultivation level, seemed to act recklessly, wielding a flashy attacking spirit artifact with great flair. However, encountering the “old sword cultivator,” it was truly unfortunate for him.

A Golden Elixir demon cultivator stationed at the battlefield also found the old sword cultivator, who was evasively circling around, quite bothersome. He sent three of his subordinates to probe the situation.

Chen Pingan wasn’t concerned about those three demon cultivators leaving the battlefield, nor was he focused on the commands of the Golden Elixir “great demon.” He remained fixated on that hidden demon cultivator, highly likely concealing his true cultivation level. The old sword cultivator further confirmed his suspicions, alerting the Golden Elixir demon cultivator to eliminate this unexpected element before it jeopardized their plans, such as ambushing Pu Yu and Ren Yi, the two young talents.

After all, both Pu Yu and Ren Yi weren’t low-ranked. They had fully participated in the previous two offensive and defensive battles. If they genuinely decided to disregard the lives of the other young sword cultivators, they had a great chance of retreating from the battlefield.

Pu Yu and Ren Yi were undoubtedly two of the Sword Qi Great Wall’s young prodigies. Just because they were on the same hill as the illustrious Qi Shou and Gao Ye Hou didn’t mean they were mere nobodies.

Even though Dong Heitan had privately commented on the two sword cultivators guarding the checkpoint, saying Ren Yi was younger among the Dragon Gate cultivators and had a quick flying sword, he had rated Pu Yu as the most ostentatious among Golden Elixir cultivators. This evaluation was accurate during actual combat and sword questioning, but it wasn’t comprehensive. The Hidden Official lineage held Pu Yu and his innate flying sword in high regard because his flying sword had exceptional effects on the battlefield, rated as tier C, second only to Qi Shou’s tier B flying sword, “Jumping Pearl.” As for tier A, that belonged to Wu Chengpei’s “Sweet Rain,” while tier B included Yue Qing’s “Hundred Zhang Spring,” “Lark in the Sky,” and the innate flying sword of the sword immortal Yuanqing Shu from the Posa Continent.

Many sword immortals’ innate flying swords were immensely powerful, yet they were rated low on the summer palace side.

Of course, this classification was a utilitarian assessment made by the Hidden Official lineage sword cultivators solely concerning the battlefield.

Now that he had identified the opponent’s true backhand, Chen Pingan no longer hesitated or meandered. He stepped onto the long sword from the sword shop, using the proper sword cultivator technique to charge toward the three probing demon cultivators. He glided close to the ground, tracing a large arc with his sword, just as he narrowly avoided an attack from an opponent’s spirit weapon. With a quick flick of his toe, his long sword surged toward one of the demon cultivators, moving as swiftly as a flying sword.

The old sword cultivator had already abandoned his long sword, unleashing his innate flying sword named “Account Book,” targeting another demon cultivator from the Sea-Watching realm. The flying sword pierced through the opponent’s head, and with a quick motion, he “held” the corpse to prevent it from exploding its innate orifice. He seamlessly snatched a copper bell from the demon’s waist and tucked it into his sleeve, then used the lifeless body as a projectile, hurling it toward a third demon cultivator amidst a dazzling magical attack.

The series of actions flowed smoothly, akin to the rhythm of flowing clouds.

With a grasp, he returned the long sword to his control, stepping onto it once more, ignoring the two low-ranked demon cultivators, and headed straight for the elusive great demon. With a flick of his toe, he dodged several magical attacks and strikes from spirit weapons, plunging the long sword into the ground. He leaped high into the air, fingers forming a seal, and his “Account Book” flying sword split into several copies, mirroring Pu Yu’s “Rain Mist.” However, the sword energy and intent of each flying sword varied in thickness, all aimed directly at the lurking dead warrior demon, vanishing in an instant.

Chen Pingan reminded Pu Yu and Ren Yi with his inner voice, his tone aged and hoarse, “Don’t be greedy for military merits; be wary of ambushes.”

The demon, seemingly a Sea-Watching realm cultivator after a prolonged battle, realized hiding was futile. He transformed, revealing himself as at least a Golden Elixir bottleneck cultivator.

A flash of sword light appeared between his brows, his innate flying sword—a mysterious power—sparkled with golden light, floating erratically around him, perfectly shielding his body. A series of crisp sounds rang out as he managed to repel the ten or so flying swords launched by the unknown old sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

This shifty dead warrior demon cultivator, possessing an innate flying sword radiating a hint of golden light, quickly gathered the light into a small particle, which grew increasingly brilliant as it shot straight toward the enemy’s head.

The old sword cultivator, sharp-eyed and having recognized the great demon’s identity, suddenly dove downward, agilely changing course to continue his advance.

The dead warrior demon casually grabbed a long sword left on the battlefield and slightly turned to the side, slashing at the old sword cultivator.

Bending his knees slightly, the old sword cultivator suddenly exerted force, kicking up dust as the ground trembled. His figure moved as quickly as a wisp of smoke, evading the flying sword and the long sword’s light, closing in.

The demon dead warrior cultivator felt reassured; his opponent had plenty of strange flying swords and wielded them skillfully. However, their killing power was average and not remarkable. Most of the flying swords likely concealed unknown innate abilities, which was the most troublesome aspect. Yet, seeing his enemy daring to engage in close combat, the demon cultivator felt emboldened; this old man didn’t know the meaning of danger and thought he could compete in physical resilience and strength!

In the blink of an eye, their flying swords clashed once more, summoning a flurry of golden sparks. Each side unleashed dozens of flying swords, and at a distance of less than five zhang, their innate flying swords once again collided. This time, sparks erupted as the sword energy rippled violently, causing a chaotic surge of spiritual energy. Many sparks touched the demon cultivators, inflicting excruciating pain, leaving behind gaping wounds that were bloodied and torn.

The demon sword cultivator grew even more confident; the two sides faced off, he still had some energy left, while his opponent appeared to be at their limit. The distance of five zhang allowed for clear visibility of both their expressions. As expected, the old sword cultivator’s innate flying swords, fast and numerous, were proving ineffective, causing him to feel a sense of retreat. A flicker of panic crossed his eyes as he slowed his next advance, feigning calm, then took a step back while pushing his flying swords to their limits, finally unleashing his innate ability—an interconnected sword formation that perfectly blocked the space between the two sword cultivators.

The demon cultivator had no more reservations. Although the old sword cultivator wasn’t a figure from the records, killing another Golden Elixir sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall would be an unexpected windfall—an accomplishment!

Using his innate flying sword to break through the opponent’s formation, the demon cultivator wouldn’t give the old sword cultivator a chance to retreat. He lunged forward, swinging his sword down upon the old cultivator’s head.

To dare to save someone, one must be prepared to pay with their life!

In his moment of panic, the old sword cultivator could only tilt his head, extending a hand to block the long sword; otherwise, he would inevitably be split in two.

Moments later.

The dead warrior demon cultivator appeared dazed as he looked down, his soul trembling, heart twisting in agony.

The old sword cultivator, mere inches away, still wore an expression of fear, yet his left hand firmly gripped the long sword. Not only that, but with his right hand, he had dug into the demon’s chest without breaking through the back, his fist clenched around an ethereal golden elixir. With a powerful surge of fist intent, he obliterated the nearby orifices, effectively sealing off the demon’s chance to detonate the golden elixir.

In his final moments, the dead warrior demon cultivator witnessed the old sword cultivator, seemingly engrossed in theatrics, wearing a sincere look of lingering fear. He then smiled and sheepishly admitted, “A small victory, a stroke of luck.”

The savage world’s siege army was split in two by a golden river forged by the combined might of the three teachings’ saints.

Sword immortals held their ground along the river, and the demon forces behind them could only fight desperately, isolated from any reinforcements, forced to engage with the mid-ranked sword cultivators leaving the city.

However, it wouldn’t be easy for the sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall to maintain their hold on the river and halt the advance of subsequent armies.

Every sword immortal needed to withstand the surging demon forces.

#### Outside the Battlefield

In the Jia Shen military tent.

Although the occupants were mostly young, this was the main tent among the sixty military tents, heavily guarded with numerous regulations. Visitors could only approach if they had pressing military matters. Even sword immortals or great demons would be executed on the spot if they dared to intrude.

Today, two distinguished guests arrived at the Jia Shen tent.

One was a burly old man dressed in a bright red robe, his radiant attire shining like clouds, flickering with red light. This robe was of celestial quality, rumored to have originated from one of the entrances to the Great Abyss, a relic of immense power. The old man had a high status, comparable to the likes of Yang Zhi and Huang Luan, though their relationships were complex and fraught with enmity.

The old man was one of the candidates for the Throne of the Hall of Heroes in the savage world, possessing even greater combat strength than the great demon Chongguang. However, he had always worked alone, which is why his reputation didn’t match that of Chongguang. His last public appearance was when he had been rumored to have his lair partially destroyed by a hasty sword strike from a traveler named A Liang, which prompted him to team up with Chongguang in a furious pursuit of A Liang for tens of thousands of miles, ultimately stopping at the Sword Qi Great Wall, where he “incidentally” experienced Dong Sangeng’s sword when emerging from the city.

Beside the old man stood a young great demon, who carried five long swords on his back. Clad in a similarly famous green robe known as “Shu Jiao Lian,” he looked youthful and handsome. However, one of his eyes was devoid of life, a dull white. The young great sword immortal didn’t bother to conceal it, even neglecting to employ any illusions. If not for that eye's flaw, he could have easily matched the sword immortal Mi Yu of the Sword Qi Great Wall in appearance.

Yet, the one distinguishing factor from Mi Yu was that this sword immortal great demon was exceptionally skilled in swordsmanship and was the youngest among the upper five realms’ sword immortal demons. During the Thirteen Battles, he had bested the well-known great sword immortal Zhang Lu, leading to Zhang Lu’s disgrace, ultimately relegating him to guarding the gate of the Upside-Down Mountain, forced to spend his days with a young Daoist who enjoyed reading on a cushion. It was said that Zhang Lu had a close relationship with the sword immortal couple from Ning Mansion, though it seemed that the three friends all suffered unfortunate fates: two died in battle, and one was left as a laughingstock.

In the Jia Shen tent, the female sword cultivator Liu Bai accompanied the military tent leader, a young man in traditional wooden sandals, as they went out to greet their guests.

The young man respectfully said, “Greetings, Old Ancestor of Guanqu, Sword Immortal Shoucheng.”

Liu Bai spoke more casually, exuding familiarity as she smiled, “Good to see you, Old Ancestor of Guanqu, Senior Brother Shoucheng.”

The great demon Guanqu nodded with a smile, “Liu Bai is looking increasingly charming. When you arrive in the Haoran world, I’ll personally help you catch some gentlemen of the academy for you to choose from.”

This was the benefit of having a master.

Liu Bai’s mentor was the second-highest seat in the Throne of Hall of Heroes, known as the old bookworm Zhou Mi, praised as the “Ocean of Learning” in the savage world. Sword Immortal Shoucheng happened to be Liu Bai’s senior brother. Among Zhou Mi’s numerous disciples, all were sword cultivators: Shoucheng, Cai Ying, Tong Xuan, Tong Yin, Yu Zao, and Liu Bai, all regarded as the hundred seeds of sword immortals selected by the Moon-Viewing Mountain.

These hundred sword immortals were ranked not by the heights of their realms but by their potential. Liu Bai’s senior brother Shoucheng not only held a high current realm but was also highly ranked, right next to Liu Cha’s direct disciple Zhu Ke, and the Moon-Viewing Mountain’s closed-door disciple Li Zhen.

Liu Bai noticed something was off about Shoucheng and worryingly asked, “Senior Brother Shoucheng?”

Not understanding why, after just a few years apart, her senior brother had sustained such severe injuries. The last she heard, he was said to have left on a long journey under the command of his master.

Shoucheng pointed to the eye he had replaced behind him. Great demons had tough physiques, especially one at the upper five realms, but he hadn’t regenerated his eye nor refined the new one, seemingly allowing others to notice his blindness in one eye. He chuckled, “That old blind man took one of my eyes and fed it to his guard dog for a snack. It’s humiliating, but such is life. I can’t rest easy without avenging this grudge, but seeking revenge is no easy task. I can only show it to outsiders as a reminder, lest I forget over time.”

Wooden Sandal was utterly shocked.

Not to mention that old blind man who liked to command golden-armored puppets to move ten thousand mountains; that “guard dog” was said to be a great demon who had broken through the bottleneck to provoke trouble but ended up becoming a literal lapdog instead.

Years ago, when the great demon Guanqu had brought sword immortal Shoucheng to negotiate with that old blind man, they had hoped to enlist his help to slay their way into the Haoran world, but it had ended in discord.

Twelve against thirteen, with celestial beings opposing ascended demons; even if they couldn’t win, they at least had a chance to escape. But if the twelfth and thirteenth realms faced the next realm, there would be no room for negotiation. Of course, ascended celestial sword immortals still possessed fighting power, as long as their swords were fast enough to break through the manifestation of the Dao. The legendary fourteenth realm was not as simple as merely having a barrier-like small realm; it was said that wherever there was a person, there was the world, and the Dao pressed down everywhere, transcending the vastness of the ten thousand mountains. The ascended realm qi cultivators within would suffer the most. Hence, the celestial realm sword cultivator Shoucheng suffered greatly; it wasn’t that his sword path was lacking, but simply because that old blind man was too powerful—strong enough to be considered a deity in the savage world, akin to a “Second Elder.”

Unless the long-vanished “First Elder” was displeased and intervened personally, otherwise, all techniques and divine abilities were mere illusions, all ultimately ephemeral.

The great demon Guanqu smiled and said, “Let’s get down to business. The Jia Zi tent fears you children might feel stifled. According to military records, they’ve rejected the Jia Shen tent’s two major proposals. Hence, I was sent to discuss some insider information with you. Once we enter the Jia Shen tent, I’ll explain the situation, and you’ll know enough. But this information must not be leaked.”

Everyone in the Jia Shen tent stood up to respectfully welcome the two elders—one an ancient figure, a celestial being in their own right, with records of their name and exploits inscribed in many pages of the ancient text of the savage world; the other a young man, renowned for their military achievements, also a sword immortal.

The old man smiled and nodded, gesturing for everyone to sit, indicating they didn’t need to be overly polite.

Sword Immortal Shoucheng scanned the group. When his gaze landed on the young sword cultivators, he paused a little longer. Among them were Li Zhen, Zhu Ke, Yu Si, Tan, and his junior sister Liu Bai, making five budding sword immortals from the savage world present in the Jia Shen tent.

The great demon Guanqu stated, “Based on your plan, including me and Chongguang, how many sword immortal heads do you expect to obtain in one go?”

Wooden Sandal responded, “If we follow our strategy and only target the Sword Qi Great Wall’s Jade Purity realm sword immortals, specifically aiming to take down this group of outsiders, including Yuan Qing Shu and Pu He, if we kill two of them, the native sword immortals of the Sword Qi Great Wall will surely not retreat, nor will they allow a chance to leave the battlefield. Thus, the best-case scenario is we can kill four or five Jade Purity realm sword immortals, plus two great sword immortals. In the worst case, we can still take down three Jade Purity realm sword immortals and one great sword immortal. After this, no matter what, the sword immortal guarding the river should withdraw.”

The great demon Guanqu nodded, “That’s an excellent outcome. The records from your tent were thoroughly reviewed by the Jia Zi tent, and your plan is meticulous. Even a one-for-one exchange with the Sword Qi Great Wall is entirely acceptable for us. This is also the reason why you’re so unwillingly invested, isn’t it?”

Wooden Sandal nodded, “Exactly. So many sword immortals have been forced to leave the city walls and engage in battle. Even if the three teachings’ saints designed a heavenly domain for them, granting some protection, it’s not unbreakable. As long as you all exert your full strength, if we collect fewer than four sword immortal heads, I, Wooden Sandal, would be willing to let Li Zhen behead me and present my head to the Jia Zi tent as an apology to you seniors.”

The elder chuckled, “The three teachings’ saints can create several rivers to help sever the battlefield and alleviate the pressure on the sword cultivators on the city walls. Have you deduced the outcome?”

Wooden Sandal shook his head, “We’ve made some guesses, but they were too esoteric, and we didn’t dare base our predictions of the battlefield’s progression on them.”

The elder replied, “This isn’t something to hold you accountable for. Such major matters can only be answered by the Jia Zi tent. You children could ponder for a hundred years and still be reliant on luck. The conclusion from the Jia Zi tent is three times. After that, the three teachings’ saints will harm the roots of the Dao.”

Wooden Sandal questioned, “The Jia Zi tent aims for the three teachings’ saints to perish here?”

The elder nodded, “After the Sword Qi Great Wall is breached, we can’t predict how the supporting saints stationed in the Haoran world will act, but the three teachings’ saints must die at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Therefore, the Jia Zi tent has reached a new decision. They won’t fully accept your plan, but they also won’t sit idly by and allow those sword immortals to flaunt their prowess. I, Chongguang, Shoucheng, and several others at adequate realms will all do our utmost to intervene. However, Shoucheng, Liu Bai’s master, and Zhu Ke’s master will not take action.”

The youth smiled brightly, saying, “The Jia Zi tent’s foresight is impressive. The younger generation of the Jia Shen tent deeply admires it.”

The elder lamented, “You are the future of our savage world; we are long past our prime.”

Then, the elder turned, smiling, “Of course, Shoucheng doesn’t count; he's still quite young.”

Wooden Sandal suddenly said, “Old Ancestor Guanqu, Sword Immortal Shoucheng, I have another request.”

The elder inquired, “What is it?”

Wooden Sandal detailed the previously agreed-upon encirclement scheme, hoping that when the time came for the sword immortals to guard the river, the five sword cultivators from the Jia Shen tent could join forces to ambush the new Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall, Chen Pingan. Thus, Wooden Sandal hoped that the Jia Zi tent would arrange for a senior to carve out a retreat route, ensuring that the Jia Shen tent would act judiciously, not rushing into action at the outset, which would put the senior in a perilous situation.

The elder stated, “This matter is significant. My nod of agreement won’t suffice; I need to discuss it with the Jia Zi tent. Wait for my news.”

The youth thanked him.

Liu Bai urged, “Senior Brother Shoucheng, be sure to get your master to agree.”

Shoucheng replied helplessly, “It depends on the effectiveness of your two plans. Otherwise, you know your master’s temperament too well.”

Aside from the major overall plan targeting the golden river, there was also a rising undercurrent of competition among the younger generation, ready to surge forth.

Leading from the Jia Shen tent, several military tents collaborated to carefully select a large group of demon dead warriors, mostly stagnant Golden Elixir or Nascent Soul bottleneck demons.

These formidable heroes, who had become sword cultivators yet remained as dead warriors, were given a booklet written by the Jia Shen tent before heading to the battlefield, detailing the information of fifty talented sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Ning Yao was featured on the front page.

Qi Shou, Gao Ye Hou, Pang Yuanji, Situ Weiran, Luo Zhenyi, Chen Sanqiu, Dong Huafu, Diezhang, Yan Zhuo, Xu Ning, Chang Taiqing, Gu Jianlong, Guo Zhujiu, Gao Youqing...

A long list of names, realms, flying swords, innate abilities, temperaments, and styles of combat, practically exhaustive in recording familiar friends likely to appear on the same battlefield, almost as detailed as the files kept by the Hidden Official lineage.

It was noted that Pang Yuanji’s name was recorded but then crossed out, with “Not to be Killed” scrawled in red ink.

During this period, a bold old Golden Elixir demon cultivator who had volunteered to serve as a dead warrior was suddenly found by the military tent cultivators and executed on the spot.

Nearby, other demon cultivators were astonished but didn’t think much of it. Those who were dead had simply died earlier, while those still alive had no need for mockery; they were just delayed in dying.

It was likely a traitor attempting to inform the Sword Qi Great Wall.

This small story about the demons and humans, sword cultivators and the cycle of life and death, the savage world and the Sword Qi Great Wall, thus vanished forever in the river of time, like a drifting leaf, floating for a long while before spinning away, leaving no trace behind.

This generation of the Sword Qi Great Wall has produced numerous talents, heralded as the second great year for sword immortals in ten thousand years. What the savage world must do next is to use the lives of their Earth Immortal sword cultivators to grind down this rival’s great year into a small year.

Though it may seem accomplished, it’s not truly a profit.

In reality, it has been proven that the pure sword intent left behind by the Sword Qi Great Wall, the older it is, the less it rejects the sword cultivators from the savage world. As long as the latter possess a pure and clear sword heart, they can also gain the favor of those ancient sword intents and seize opportunities for the Dao.

Across the realms, when it comes to sword paths and fortunes, the Sword Qi Great Wall is undoubtedly the most grand and prosperous.

Once the Sword Qi Great Wall is breached, sword immortals perish, and the younger prodigies left alive dwindle, the savage world will seize even more, allowing the seeds of a hundred sword immortals to flourish rapidly as if receiving sweet rain.

On the battlefield, Pu Yu was not idle, fully unleashing his innate flying sword “Rain Mist.” Even if he couldn’t contribute greatly, he aimed to ensure that the old sword cultivator, who seemed precarious, wouldn’t fall into a dire situation while trying to save them. After all, for sword cultivators, nurturing their flying swords not only tempered their sword intents but also refined their physiques. Given the demons' natural toughness, if they managed to become sword cultivators, their physical resilience would reach an exaggerated level.

Ren Yi worked alongside Pu Yu’s flying sword techniques, swiftly piercing through demon cultivators. However, the presence of the Golden Elixir demons meant that they deliberately abandoned Pu Yu and Ren Yi. Unless their flying swords got close enough, they specifically targeted the younger sword cultivators of lower ranks, making it challenging for the two young prodigies to unleash their swords freely.

The other young sword cultivators had received Pu Yu and Ren Yi’s warnings and focused on mutual support, controlling their flying swords to protect themselves.

That old sword cultivator who had stealthily secured a Golden Elixir into his sleeve seemed to have sustained a severe injury. He was blown away, rolling to his feet, “coughing blood” into his palm, before summoning his flying sword to poke at the already lifeless body of the dead warrior demon. Then he darted sideways, sliding several zhang across the ground, unsteadily rising and wiping blood from his face.

The old sword cultivator reached down and grabbed the long sword from the ground.

Another fierce streak of sword light shot toward him.

Another Golden Elixir demon cultivator!

The old sword cultivator held his long sword and blocked the incoming sword light, sending him skidding backward, carving a deep trench in the ground.

Ultimately, the long sword from the sword shop was broken by the sword light. The old sword cultivator pinched his fingers and commanded the broken sword back to his sheath, facing off against the isolated Golden Elixir dead warrior cultivator from a distance.

Not only were the young sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall, like Pu Yu, utterly stunned, but even the Golden Elixir demons and their subordinates were also perplexed. When did their side suddenly gain two of the most valuable sword cultivators from the savage world?

Chen Pingan had a rough idea.

The savage world had long arranged a backhand for this battle. For instance, Pu Yu and Ren Yi had each summoned a Golden Elixir sword cultivator as dead warriors.

They were older and likely those who had stagnated for years at their bottlenecks with no hope of breaking through, making them perfect candidates for dead warrior assassins.

If such situations proliferated across the battlefield, it was a meticulous scheme premeditated by the savage world, posing significant trouble for the young prodigy sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Thus, Chen Pingan no longer intended to linger long. After surveying this battlefield, he would first send a message to Wei Jin at the city walls, relaying the information to the Summer Palace before hurrying to the next battlefield.

After all, he was still Fan Dache’s protective sword master, and he needed to fulfill his promise.

Chen Pingan rolled up his sleeves, planted a foot on the ground, and instantly vanished from sight.

The Golden Elixir demon cultivator clearly felt disoriented. With his flying sword already drawn, he couldn’t find his opponent and was at a loss for what to do. 

In an instant, this weary-looking Golden Elixir cultivator was sent flying backward, his resilient body crashing through the encirclement, and the demons he struck burst apart, dying on the spot.

The old sword cultivator, dressed in the sword shop’s garments and the tailor’s robe, followed closely behind, and without waiting for the Golden Elixir cultivator’s body to hit the ground, he delivered a second punch, shattering the body along with its Golden Elixir.

The next moment, the old sword cultivator landed gracefully, quietly sending a message to the city walls. The Earth Immortal sword cultivators stationed there needed to mobilize some of their ranks to leave the city. Afterward, they should conceal their auras, aiming to ambush the opposing dead warrior cultivators.

The demon army on this battlefield scattered like birds and beasts, fleeing in a panic. Several Golden Elixir demon cultivators hastily summoned their defenses, aiming to retreat toward the south without straying too far. Transitioning to another battlefield to continue fighting wouldn’t be a mistake; besides, the battlefield was now severed, and the supervising officers from the savage world could hardly manage issues of cowardice at this point. The demons in the fray, while all desperately striving for military merits, ultimately didn’t seek death; even touching the city walls was beneficial, as it would still count as an accomplishment.

Among the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall, only Pu Yu pursued the fleeing demons.

Ren Yi cast a glance at the old sword cultivator retreating on his sword, his expression complicated.

Pu Yu said helplessly, “No need to guess; it’s that damned second shopkeeper.”

But neither of them quite understood how, in just a year apart, he’d transformed into the new Hidden Official, seeming like an entirely different person. 

Especially the weight of his final punch felt unsettling to these young sword cultivators, almost suffocating.

What would it feel like to face him on the battlefield?

The two battle-hardened prodigy sword cultivators simultaneously cleared their minds, achieving a state of clarity, their sword hearts pure and serene, striving to draw their swords faster.

As for whether that young Hidden Official had truly cultivated or was merely donning a new guise, neither cared to speculate; whatever the truth was, only heaven knew.

Regardless, they recognized that this was, in essence, someone of their generation.

Now, slaying Golden Elixirs felt as easy as picking up weeds.

Beneath both fists and swords, they felt like mere ants.

 ### Chapter 761: Opening the Formation

Above the vast sea of clouds in the Sword Qi Great Wall, an esteemed Daoist sage stood to greet the visitor with utmost respect, bowing deeply before smiling and saying, “It’s a rare honor, truly a rare honor.”

Chen Qingdu chuckled, “To stand tall and see far is certainly better than the view from my humble little straw hut.”

Once the pleasantries were exchanged, there was little left to discuss. The venerable sword immortal merely gazed towards the bustling battlefield in the south.

Suddenly, the Daoist sage asked, “Why does that young Hidden Official seem to harbor some bias against me?”

Chen Qingdu replied, “He has grievances with the Daoist sect as a whole, not just against you personally. In fact, he is aware that such feelings are unreasonable, but it’s difficult to change one’s mindset instantly.”

There are always peculiar individuals who can easily let go of grievances aimed at themselves, yet hold onto grudges against others’ words and actions, finding it hard to forgive. The old sword immortal had encountered many such people. Without delving into distant memories, even those around him, including Pang Yuanji, fit this description.

The sage raised his sleeve and began to calculate with his fingers. Although he preferred not to engage in such practices privately, with the old sword immortal appearing, he felt no restraint. After a moment of calculation, he remarked, “I never imagined there would be such a significant grudge entangled here. No wonder, no wonder.”

This Daoist sage was the most detached person from the mundane world within the entire Sword Qi Great Wall. He had truly achieved a state of purity in his cultivation. Not only did he ignore the affairs of the Great Wall, but he also paid little attention to the rise and fall of his own sect.

No one sought him out, and he did not seek anyone in return.

The sage, responsible for safeguarding the Sword Qi Great Wall, was the most accomplished disciple of the Dao Ancestor. If he were to return to the White Jade Capital of the Celestial Realm, in the five cities and twelve towers, one of the towers—extremely high—would be his immortal abode, his place of cultivation.

Chen Qingdu said, “All these years, it’s been a waste of your time, making it difficult to progress further. You’ve worked hard.”

The Daoist quickly bowed again. “I’m honored, truly honored.”

Chen Qingdu sighed, “If that young man were to meet you in person, I suspect you two would indeed have a lot to discuss.”

The Daoist shook his head after calculating again. “Not necessarily, not necessarily.”

Chen Qingdu was not inclined to say more. It was not ideal to come and leave without saying anything, so he stood still, overlooking the southern battlefield.

The Daoist suddenly exclaimed, “Our young Hidden Official actually has some connection with that Daoist Sun from the Xuandu Temple?”

The head of the Xuandu Temple, Sun Huaizhong, was already well-versed in swordsmanship. He was also praised as the fifth person in the Celestial Realm who was unshakeable, even when struck by lightning.

The Daoist sighed, “I never expected this Sun Daoist to leave his own realm to venture into the Vast World.”

Counting was one thing, but calculating for a long time was another, almost akin to divine prophecy.

Chen Qingdu chuckled, “The lineage of the Daoist sword immortals still has some merit. That Sun Daoist is, indeed, quite interesting.”

For the old sword immortal to say that someone had “some merit” regarding swordsmanship was no small compliment. Otherwise, why would Chen Qingdu, with nothing better to do, frequently find someone to say that their swordsmanship wasn’t high enough? It was well-known that he was already the unrivaled first person in the Vast World.

The four immortal swords represented the four major schools of swordsmanship in the world.

One was from the Celestial Master’s estate in Longhu Mountain, another from the most accomplished scholar in the Central Continent, one belonged to Daoist Lao Er, and the last was claimed by the Sword Suppression Tower, one of the nine grand towers in the Vast World.

In fact, the sword possessed by the scholar of the Central Continent should rightfully belong to the Daoist sword immortal lineage. In both sentiment and reason, it should be enshrined in the ancestral hall of Xuandu Temple. However, this involved an extremely complex web of origins, and since Sun Huaizhong was more of a chivalrous man than a Daoist, he had always been unwilling to retrieve it forcefully for the Xuandu Temple.

Thus, the scholar later achieved the feat of breaking the Yellow River cave with a single strike, giving rise to the phrase that spread throughout the world: “Bai Ye’s poetry is unmatched, the most accomplished in the mortal realm.”

The Daoist reminisced, “I suddenly recall that at Xuandu Temple, when the peach blossoms bloom, if there are yellow orioles among the flowers, it is especially enchanting; the eyes dare not move, the heart and soul stirred.”

Chen Qingdu laughed, “Isn’t it ‘extremely beautiful, extremely beautiful’?”

The Daoist shook his head, “That is too mundane.”

————

At the wine shop with three storefronts, business was rather slow. It wasn’t just this shop; all the taverns and inns in the city were similarly quiet.

The elderly, young, women, and children—only those whose life-force swords had been broken or those unworthy of being called sword cultivators remained in the city; especially with the fierce battle raging over the city wall, few would spend money on drinks at such a time.

The two young attendants in the shop, the boy Qiulong and the girl Liu E, were puzzled because the youngest colleague in the shop, the child Taoban, had previously rushed over to Feng Kangle and whispered something, then ran off together. When they returned, the two children were already bruised and dusty. After taking their seats, Feng Kangle had his father prepare two big bowls of plain noodles, and the two, being too small, had to lean over the table to eat, their feet dangling off the ground. There were no condiments because Taoban said that without buying drinks, they couldn’t have any, as it was the shop’s rule.

Liu E sat down beside them and asked with a smile, “What happened?”

Feng Kangle was sullen, burying his head in the noodles.

Taoban huffed, “A bunch of little bastards said our second shopkeeper is heartless, not a good person, and said a lot of nasty things. Aren’t they asking for a beating? So, Kangle and I gave them a good thrashing.”

The girl teased, “So who beat up whom?”

Feng Kangle scoffed, “They had more people, okay? How could the two of us fight? A good man travels the rivers and lakes, but two fists can’t take on four hands; it’s written in books, don’t you know that?”

Taoban was getting angrier, “What’s most infuriating is those who just watched from the sidelines. They heard our second shopkeeper’s untold stories and didn’t even help us. These guys are even more heartless.”

Liu E bit back her laughter, “I’ll get those two eggs for you; you can use them for your bruises.”

Taoban nodded, “Kangle, let your dad make us two bowls of plain noodles; we’ll each have a bowl with a fried egg. That’ll be delicious.”

Feng Kangle leaned over, whispering, “No, no, no, we’re injured—better wait a bit, it’s best if the second shopkeeper doesn’t see us.”

Taoban asked, “Why? The second shopkeeper is so stingy; he won’t give you any money.”

Feng Kangle chuckled, “I want to hear more stories.”

Taoban rolled his eyes, “And then tell that little girl? You’re too young; you don’t realize that these pretty girls are clever. Whether they have money at home is what truly matters.”

Feng Kangle laughed, “My family is rich now.”

Taoban quietly ate his plain noodles.

Feng Kangle scratched his head and softly said, “Taoban, if you ever run out of money, remember to borrow from me first. I have a pot full of copper coins; it’s so heavy now I can barely lift it! But that’s all my wife’s money. When you get a wife, remember to pay me back.”

Feng Kangle and Taoban talked about everything. Once, he recounted his grievances about getting up in the middle of the night to relieve himself, only to fall asleep next to the broom at the door. His parents searched for him all night, eventually finding him, leading to a beating that made him cry out loud. Upon hearing this, Taoban lowered his head and began to cry. Later, Feng Kangle learned that Taoban’s ancestors had all worked in a clothing workshop, and he hardly ever saw his parents.

Taoban suddenly smiled, “Actually, I quite like that little girl.”

Feng Kangle was stunned.

Taoban burst into laughter, “Just kidding! What’s so good about a girl?”

Feng Kangle laughed along.

The young boy Qiulong brought over two eggs and said, “Put it on my tab.”

Taoban imitated the second shopkeeper, giving a thumbs up. “Generous!”

Feng Kangle nodded, “I’m good friends with the second shopkeeper; our relationship is strong. I’ll have him act as a matchmaker and set you up with Liu E.”

The boy was left speechless.

The girl’s face turned beet red, her face resembling a blossoming peach flower.

———

The Hidden Official’s cold-weather palace was usually empty, but today it was filled with over ten people.

Apart from an elderly woman with white hair, all were children, the youngest being four or five years old, the oldest no more than seven or eight, with both boys and girls among them. They came from very different backgrounds, some being wealthy children from Tai Xiang Street and Jade Ruler Street, while others were street urchins who had to fight and scrape to survive.

The old woman said, “You are all budding warriors. In the past, we had martial arts masters in the Sword Qi Great Wall, but most didn’t live long. It’s challenging to survive past a hundred years. The path of martial arts relies on talent, but even more on diligent practice. Thus, if one lives a shorter life, their realm is naturally limited. I count as one of the fortunate ones. Do you know who I am?”

A bold child from Tai Xiang Street, despite being young, replied confidently, “You’re Granny Bai from the Ning House, a tough old lady.”

“Correct, I am Bai Lianshuang, from the Ning House, a female warrior with decent boxing skills.” The old woman smiled and nodded, then kicked the child in the abdomen, sending him flying and rolling on the ground, curled up in pain with tears and snot streaming down his face.

The old woman asked, “Do you know why I’ve gathered you here?”

A pale-faced girl from Jade Ruler Street trembled and said, “Granny Bai, I want to become a sword cultivator. I don’t want to learn martial arts; martial arts lead to no future.”

The old woman rubbed the girl’s head and pressed down gently, causing her to sit on the ground. She glanced at the more delicate child on the floor, gauging carefully; she could only say that his bone structure was acceptable. With a smile, she said, “Whether you want to become a sword cultivator or not is a different matter from whether you can become one. In my early years, I had similar thoughts as you, but not being able to become a sword cultivator is simply unavoidable. One cannot force it.”

Just as the girl was about to speak, the old woman smiled and continued, “Don’t rush. A month from now, those who want to learn martial arts may not necessarily stay, while those who don’t want to may end up staying.”

The old woman turned her gaze to the group of children who were cautious but had fiery eyes. “The aptitude for martial arts is not as crucial as learning swordsmanship, at least not in relative terms. However, to succeed, you must endure significant hardships. Would you agree?”

The children nodded in unison.

The old woman said, “First, I’ll teach you a couple of basic stances. Without stances, there can be no martial arts. I’ll teach you a standing and walking stance. It’s simple to start, but mastering it is not easy. Practicing martial arts, you must first achieve proficiency.”

After teaching the eight children the standing and walking stances, she walked slowly, observing the children awkwardly trying to hold their stances, and said, “To punch a thousand times leads to natural movement. Whether you believe this statement or not, understand the principle behind it: you must practice your punches more. What you shouldn’t doubt is that just because you’ve punched a thousand times, it doesn’t mean you will naturally master it. Even if you are a martial arts genius with excellent bone structure, talent, and temperament, merely punching a thousand times is still insufficient to grasp the essence of the punches.”

The child who had just rolled on the ground sat up and grit his teeth, saying, “What about that genius martial artist from the Central Continent, Cao Ci? Doesn’t he need to practice a thousand punches for the same technique? Certainly not!”

The old woman was not angry; she looked at the child and smiled, “In the Vast World, martial arts are grand, and pure martial artists can punch without reason, yet they also pay attention to learning etiquette before mastering the techniques and virtue before practicing martial arts.”

The child crossed his arms, sneering, “I’m talking about martial arts, and you’re lecturing me on principles? Granny Bai, I doubt your martial arts skills are that impressive.”

The old woman’s expression softened further, as she walked around the eight children who were beginning to sway in their stances. “A righteous heart leads to righteous punches, while a wicked heart leads to wicked punches. Thus, teaching punches is teaching people.”

The child observed the increasingly smiling old woman and sensed something was amiss, so he loudly declared, “You’re just an old lady! Learning punches from you is worse than learning from the second shopkeeper; he’s a real expert! I’ve seen him strike firsthand! Sure, he lost to Cao Ci three times earlier, but didn’t he win against Yu Jianfu three times afterward?”

The old woman laughed heartily, “You little brat are quite clever! Alright, enough! Stand up and join the others in their stances. If you stand well, you’ll take fewer hits. The six-step walking stance I taught you just now is from Mr. Chen.”

The child stood up, rubbing his belly, and grinned through gritted teeth; it genuinely hurt.

The old woman smiled; the child’s pain was real, merely flesh wounds, and he would soon endure it.

The child muttered, “A family with a handful of grain won’t eat this way.”

The old woman shot him a glance.

The child immediately howled, “I’ll learn! I’ll learn, alright?”

The old woman felt somewhat helpless. Dealing with children was indeed more suited for her son-in-law.

In truth, even teaching punches was not her forte.

Even if Bai Lianshuang had once been the only tenth-tier martial artist of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Even if she had fed punches to her son-in-law in the Ning House, the old woman herself felt guilty and truly couldn’t bring herself to be harsh or deliver heavy strikes.

However, her son-in-law had said that the seeds of martial artists in the Sword Qi Great Wall were inconspicuous, but how they would fare in the future was uncertain. Even if one had a skill, it was ultimately a good thing.

————

Chen Pingan found a secluded area and swiftly changed his appearance to that of a youthful figure.

Secretly taking out a borrowed long sword from a sword workshop, he stowed the broken sword behind him into his spatial item, intending to return it to Pang Yuanji later.

Once he resumed sword riding, his aura instantly transformed from that of a worn-out elder into that of a vibrant young man, with bright eyes and an energetic demeanor.

The great refining swords were to be drawn only during crucial times; unless in emergencies, one must not unsheathe a sword. 

All of his celestial-grade swords, the “Sword Immortal” and his golden robes, had been handed over to Ning Yao.

Thus, Chen Pingan’s sword riding journey, coupled with the summoning of one or two of his “ledger” swords, served as the best disguise for him to enter the battlefield as a genuine sword cultivator.

As for the face masks made by Zhu Lian, those were secondary.

After all, having more skills than necessary was always beneficial.

Chen Pingan’s heart stirred as he soared quickly to a higher vantage point, surveying the battlefield’s situation before descending back down closer to the ground.

On the battlefield, thousands of sword cultivators were steadily advancing southward, continuously compressing the demon army.

The fiercest fighting was along the golden river, where the demon army surged and crashed against the sword immortals defending the river. Often, after a sword immortal struck, the gaps left behind allowed the demon army to quickly form a sloped hill, pressing against the invisible barrier of this small world, causing the golden river’s waves to splash blood everywhere. Each retreat of the waves left behind countless bones, which were subsequently covered by the demon horde, layer upon layer, constantly eroding the words inscribed along the banks of the golden river.

The sword immortals could only slightly retract their swords, sweeping their blades across the immediate battlefield to prevent too many bones and flesh from accumulating in place, which would wear down the golden river.

Each character inscribed in gold, akin to tiny flying insects, and each golden lotus swaying in the river, were constantly disappearing. It was only because the three great sages were continuously bestowing their powers from afar that this small world did not dissipate too quickly.

On that battlefield, several mighty demons had already appeared, many of whom wielded innate supernatural abilities, such as moving mountains and diverting rivers, continuously hurling mountains at the golden river and the heads of the sword immortals, or unleashing torrents of heavy, foul rain.

Some of the larger demons directly employed spells to tear the earth apart, boring into the ground, and with a thunderous roar, they would rip through the surface, braving a sword immortal’s strike to attempt to turn the unyielding golden river into a suspended one, thus swiftly linking the demon armies from the southern battlefield to those in the north.

Sitting at both ends of the city wall, two sages simultaneously unleashed their great abilities, causing the waters of the entire river to surge violently as if cascading down in waterfalls. At the same time, the roots of each golden lotus plunged deep into the earth along with the flowing river, where lines of delicate golden characters wound around them, the content consisting of famous poems praising the lotus by literary masters and poets of the world.

Among the golden river beneath a female sword immortal, a particularly large and beautiful lotus bloomed, towering over a hundred feet high, its fragrance wafting far and wide, condensing strands of golden spiritual energy that eventually coalesced into beads of water, cascading down onto the lotus leaves, creating a tinkling sound.

Lines of golden characters danced like birds and swayed like trees, charmingly graceful.

“Flowers of water, land, and plants; how many are truly lovely?” 

“Not vine-like nor brambly, standing tall and pure. Emerging from the muddy waters, yet not stained.”

The female sword immortal, Zhou Cheng, landed gracefully on the ever-expanding lotus leaf, standing amidst the golden lotus, the heavens and earth appearing a bit clearer, and spiritual energy abundant.

With each strike she made, her movements became increasingly fluid and expressive.

At that moment, the already stunning female sword immortal became even more breathtaking.

Alongside her, a male sword immortal, Mi Hu, fought fiercely, his strikes flowing seamlessly, and at the same time, he communicated with her through thought, “You really don’t want to be my sister-in-law?”

Zhou Cheng replied nonchalantly, “Mi Yu is nothing but a decorative pillow, and he likes to say things that I don’t understand—extremely annoying.”

Mi Hu fell silent for a moment before asking, “Then what about me?”

Zhou Cheng also paused for a moment before responding, “Too ugly.”

Recently becoming a great sword immortal, Mi Hu was not angered; instead, he burst into hearty laughter, launching another strike, showcasing his extraordinary style.

In the face of life and death, one could see the great charm of sword immortals.

Chen Pingan rode his sword swiftly, heading towards a certain part of the southern battlefield, searching for those sword cultivators who were advancing southward the quickest.

With Diezhang and Dong Heitan leading the way, it was difficult to slow down.

The demon army also abandoned the thought of charging headlong, as if they could successfully slay those sword cultivators emerging from the city, their contributions would be far greater than merely attempting to scale the city walls. Moreover, once they approached the city wall, the sword immortals stationed there would only become fiercer, leading to swift deaths. Surrounding and hunting those sword cultivators on the battlefield would at least grant them a few more moments of life.

Thus, south of the Sword Qi Great Wall and north of the golden river, a series of encirclements of varying sizes inadvertently formed on the vast battlefield.

Whether near or far, many familiar faces were visible.

The sword immortal Tao Wen stood at the front lines of the most distant battlefield, steadfastly guarding that golden river alongside other sword immortals.

Closer to the action, besides the previously encountered Pu Yu and Ren Yi, there was also the Yuan Ying sword cultivator Ye Zhenchun, who had taken on the role of a protective formation sword master, as well as frequent patrons of the wine shop who had consumed many bowls of plain noodles and many drinks, alongside various gamblers and scoundrels.

While searching for Ning Yao and the others, Chen Pingan could only do what he could to save a few sword cultivators in dire situations, allowing them to temporarily escape the encirclement.

According to the regulations established by the Hidden Official’s lineage, in the southward advance to carve formations and eliminate the demon army, sword cultivators of different realms would have different distances to progress. Once they reached that distance or eliminated the corresponding number of demons, they could retreat back to the base of the Sword Qi Great Wall for rest; if they had the strength, they could continue southward, but if they suffered severe losses, they would have to ascend the city wall, swapping out for a fresh batch of sword cultivators to replace them in the battlefield. It was absolutely forbidden to be greedy for merit or to think of exchanging lives with the demons.

The sword cultivators on the city wall above and below the same battle line were to retreat and advance, the former needing to be decisive; otherwise, once the descending sword cultivators became overly attached to battle and refused to retreat, suffering heavy casualties, the latter would have to exit the city early to fill the gaps. Over time, the entire north-south battle line would become utterly rotten, turning into a mess requiring additional sword cultivators to clean up.

In the end, the Hidden Official’s lineage still hoped that the sword cultivators could survive and continue to strike, thus allowing them to save more lives.

However, a war inevitably meant that people would continue to die, and die again.

Life and death, on the battlefield, were like neighbors facing each other through a door.

The demon army, blocked from retreat, had to be annihilated, and the middle-tier sword cultivators beneath the Sword Qi Great Wall needed to minimize their battle losses.

The migratory troops from the Savage World heading towards the northern battlefield continued to arrive, but every time a sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall fell, it meant a loss of strength for the Great Wall. These were merely cold calculations on paper; what about the calculations of the human heart?

On the battlefield where both sides were slaughtering each other, the group of sword cultivators closest to the golden river, who had emerged from the city, suddenly halted their advance in unison.

Even the fierce Diezhang sheathed her sword, choosing to retreat a few dozen feet, holding her great sword firmly while bending slightly, the tip of her sword resting against the ground, standing shoulder to shoulder with Dong Huafu.

Their innate flying swords continued to strike down enemies without pause.

The reason was simple; they had broken the formation too quickly, and demons surrounded them on both sides.

In the further back of the battlefield stood Ning Yao, wearing golden robes and carrying a sword box containing the Sword Immortal, holding only one sword in her hand.

Twenty feet to Ning Yao’s left and right stood Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo.

Fan Dache stood even further back.

This group of sword cultivators should have advanced over a hundred and fifty miles before beginning to retreat and cut down the numerous stragglers behind them.

However, just a moment ago, Ning Yao had said something felt off.

The situation that could make Ning Yao feel uneasy was something Diezhang and Dong Heitan had to treat with utmost caution.

Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo liked to wield their respective swords, “Scripture” and “Purple Lightning,” as flying swords.

Apart from their innate flying swords, the trajectories of their two extra swords were extremely orderly. Chen Sanqiu’s long sword “Scripture” flew in a large circle around him, while Yan Zhuo’s “Purple Lightning” traced a somewhat higher circle, both swords not conflicting. If any demons were to rely on luck or brute force to sneak into their encirclement, they wouldn’t need to interfere, leaving it all to Ning Yao and Fan Dache to clean up—simple and direct.

As for the careless Diezhang and the clumsy Dong Heitan, Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo didn’t bother with them.

After all, if there was truly an unexpected situation, the one in charge, Ning Yao, would take action to resolve it.

Chen Sanqiu originally had another cloud-patterned sword, which he had lent to Fan Dache.

These highly ranked swords were all borrowed from the imitation White Jade Capital of the Great Li Dynasty by A Liang.

Only the “Vast Energy” sword that Diezhang favored had been taken to the Vast World by a certain Confucian gentleman.

Ning Yao then said, “There must be an ambush. I’ll hold off the highest realm opponents for a moment; you all just focus on retreating.”

Her tone was similar to her usual light-hearted manner, but only Diezhang, another woman, could detect the subtle undertones.

Ning Yao held a slight grudge.

Diezhang felt helpless as well; ever since all the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official’s lineage moved to the cold-weather palace, the young Hidden Official had not shown up on the city wall for too long.

Even Fan Dache, who had finally reached the Yuan Dan realm, had not come to celebrate, and he was the first to want to share the good news—not his friend Chen Sanqiu.

Ning Yao glanced around; the battlefield situation was, in fact, not unusual; after all, the area was swarming with demon forces from every direction.

Ning Yao frowned. She was about to remind Fan Dache to retreat first, and let Diezhang and Dong Huafu guard him from behind to prevent him from being surrounded by the demon horde. As for herself, she could afford to return to the north a bit slower alongside Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo. Both of her friends had protective charms and life-saving talismans, and Yan Zhuo was particularly adept at self-preservation. Their killing speed might not match Diezhang and Dong Heitan, but they maintained a good balance between killing and self-defense.

However, before Ning Yao could convey her thoughts, she was surprised to see Fan Dache already soaring into the air on his sword, decisively withdrawing to the north without a word.

Ning Yao was puzzled; when did Fan Dache become so perceptive?

Not only that, but he was also being guided by a boy who appeared to be “swaying” as he rode his sword, narrowly dodging the demon army’s magical artifacts. Eventually, the boy firmly grabbed Fan Dache’s shoulder, cheerfully calling out, “Let’s go!” as he swung his arm, delivering a solid kick to the hilt of Fan Dache’s cloud-patterned sword, propelling him and his sword away swiftly.

The somewhat awkward exit of the golden dan sword cultivator Fan Dache became a quick retreat; he wasted no time, focusing solely on fleeing.

The reasons were twofold: the long-awaited call of “Dache!” and the newcomer’s succinct words, “Aren’t you going to run? Do you want to give away your life?”

Simultaneously, every sword cultivator’s heart resonated with an all-too-familiar voice, quick and decisive, “Retreat in order; I will be the rear guard with Ning Yao. Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo will provide support in the center. Diezhang and Dong Heitan will clear the way behind Fan Dache. We must maintain a distance of over a hundred feet between us—not too far, not too short. There are many hidden ambushes; I’ve presently identified two locations: one northeast of Diezhang, about thirty feet away, and one southwest of Fan Dache, roughly a hundred and twenty feet away. Be cautious; the opponents are likely sword cultivators starting at the Yuan Dan realm, with the highest likelihood of some Yuan Ying-level cultivators, possibly even Jade Skin sword immortals. Stay alert.”

“Especially be cautious of opponents targeting Dache first; they may attempt to encircle him. Dache, please be more subtle with your sword’s trajectory; do you plan to crash right into their flying swords?”

“Sanqiu, Fat Yan, be prepared to use your most trusted protective artifacts at any moment. The enemies in this ambush are determined to achieve their goal. The death warriors are all demon sword cultivators, and they will not let us retreat easily. Remember to protect Fan Dache at all times.”

The usual nagging, chattering voice.

Chen Pingan could only arrange the formations at the fastest possible pace; there was no need for further speculation.

There were bound to be two or three Yuan Ying-level death warriors hiding well, waiting for the right moment to strike. Perhaps there might even be an even deeper-hidden Jade Skin sword immortal among the demons, ready to disregard their life to issue a strike.

The reasoning was simple: apart from the newly promoted Yuan Dan Fan Dache, everyone else among the sword cultivators was on the Savage World’s death list.

Ning Yao, Chen Sanqiu, Dong Huafu, Diezhang, and Yan Zhuo—all were among the elite of the Sword Qi Great Wall in recent years.

Ning Yao raised an eyebrow, appearing somewhat annoyed by the person’s incessant chatter, but in her eyes, which were the most beautiful in the world, there was a subtle ripple of happiness, joy, and pride.

Like ripples in a lake stirred by a gentle spring breeze.

A tall boy hovered on his sword beside her.

They were no longer merely Ning Yao of the Sword Qi Great Wall and Chen Pingan of the Vast World.

They were sword cultivators appearing together on the battlefield.

Every beginning is difficult, and this guy next to her tended to overthink, making things even harder than the initial challenge. 

But once he got started, she didn’t have to worry about him anymore.

For instance, when he liked her.

Or when he practiced fists.

Or when he aimed to become a sword cultivator and eventually a great sword immortal.

Ning Yao asked telepathically, “Innate flying swords?”

Chen Pingan smiled and replied, “Two.”

Ning Yao fell silent again.

See? 

Chen Pingan had no idea what Ning Yao was pondering and couldn’t afford to guess her thoughts.

What worried him the most was that the enemy’s death warriors had chosen to remain silent, continuing to conceal their tracks.

The battle line that Ning Yao and the others were responsible for, on the city wall side, had neither subsequent sword cultivators to replace those descending from the city nor did they need to kill more enemies; they had to carve formations as swiftly as possible, penetrating deep into the enemy lines to approach the golden river for their mission to be accomplished.

Once both sides reached a stalemate, the newly minted Yuan Dan Fan Dache would become the best breakthrough point.

It would not make sense to require Fan Dache to directly leave the battlefield and watch from the sidelines, both sentimentally and reasonably.

No matter what, Chen Pingan could only confirm that his arrival might have killed one unexpected outcome but could also bring forth an even larger unforeseen event.

This was akin to the two plans proposed by Xuan Can and Xu Ning—before the results were revealed, no one knew which choice was better.

The most helpless part was that Xu Ning’s plan, once implemented by the Hidden Official’s lineage, might not necessarily yield a better result than Xuan Can’s, but at that moment, Chen Pingan was unwilling to voice such heavy words, nor could Miao Shi say it, and Lin Junbi was too afraid to say so.

Calculating human affairs compared to the calculations of heaven gave a sense of insignificance and helplessness, no matter how hard one tried to plan.

This was Chen Pingan’s most profound realization after becoming the Hidden Official.

The group continued to fight while retreating.

Diezhang and Dong Heitan did their best to protect Fan Dache as they withdrew from the battlefield, with Ning Yao and Chen Pingan stationed behind them. Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo were free from concerns, focusing on slaying demons.

Ning Yao did not summon her flying sword; she simply wielded her sword, still giving the impression that the essence of swordsmanship in the world boiled down to the notion of straightforwardness.

With one strike after another, Ning Yao’s demeanor shifted from calm to swift, her sword energy cutting through and dismembering a large expanse of foes.

As a result, Chen Pingan, riding his sword close to Ning Yao, found himself momentarily idle, attentively observing the intricate details of the battlefield.

Adding to this, the two death sword cultivators who had previously exposed themselves were discovered by Chen Pingan, along with a demon sword cultivator emanating Yuan Dan energy, who had unwittingly been swept by Ning Yao’s sword energy, narrowly dodging it. To conceal his identity, he intentionally suffered some injuries, allowing his shoulder to be sliced by the sword energy, leaving a large gash.

Ning Yao’s strikes aimed for speed, sometimes appearing somewhat aimless, clearly intentional, allowing Chen Pingan to observe more subtle details.

When Ning Yao’s group of sword cultivators, who had been the most rapid in breaking formations and closest to the golden river, unexpectedly became the sword cultivators closest to the city wall instead.

Chen Sanqiu and the others didn’t mind this at all.

After all, the demon army along this line wouldn’t contest their advance.

Furthermore, no one felt they would penetrate the formation any slower than the sword cultivators in other lines.

Because with Ning Yao, and now Chen Pingan, everyone felt this was the most reasonable outcome.

Having temporarily distanced themselves from the precarious situation, Fan Dache hesitated to speak.

Chen Sanqiu whispered, “It’s alright; don’t feel embarrassed.”

Diezhang and the others similarly thought that Fan Dache was planning to return to the city first.

However, Fan Dache said, “Since I have the lowest realm and the least skill, let me be the bait. I’m not afraid of thieves; I’m afraid they’re covetous. Instead of everyone being distracted, it’s better to take the initiative.”

Chen Pingan was somewhat surprised.

Fan Dache looked towards Chen Pingan, “Protective formation sword master, what do you say?”

Chen Pingan thought for a moment and nodded with a smile, “Alright.”

He glanced towards the battlefield ahead, where an immensely peculiar scene unfolded: the demon army clustered in a line just one hundred feet away from this group of young sword cultivators from the Sword Qi Great Wall, and they surprisingly showed no inclination to advance.

Chen Pingan said, “I’ll guard the rear. You all just focus on your strikes.”

Then he looked at Ning Yao, who nodded, “Alright.”

Ning Yao returned her long sword to its sheath behind her, but the Sword Immortal was still in hand, “I’ll open the formation.”

Diezhang and Dong Heitan exchanged glances, laughing, “Alright.”

Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo were filled with anticipation.

The reasoning was simple: what would it feel like to fight alongside Fan Dache?

Then for Chen Sanqiu and the others, who had fought alongside Ning Yao over the years, it was even more profound.

Because Ning Yao had always accommodated and cared for these “geniuses”; she had been constrained for too long in her strikes.

Finally, Ning Yao added, “Opening the formation will be quick; don’t fall behind.”

(End of this chapter)

 ### Chapter 762: No Sword to Draw

In the realm of martial arts, Cao Ci was to fists what Ning Yao was to swords. It was as if they were born with an innate connection to the grand cosmic forces of heaven and earth. This was a stark contrast to Chen Ping'an's first life sword, "Caged Sparrow," and Qi Jinglong's self-proclaimed sword, "Regulation," both of which represented their own unique mastery of flying swords and could create a small realm of their own. The former two, however, were on an entirely different level.

Thus, when Ning Yao stepped out of the formation, holding her sword poised to break through the enemy lines, the originally stalled demonic army inexplicably began to retreat. This caused the front lines of the army to become more densely packed, almost comically cumbersome.

Perhaps this was the instinctive response of all living things to the changing tides of nature, just as humans can sense the seasons shift between warmth and cold. 

Chen Ping'an was genuinely looking forward to witnessing Ning Yao unleash her sword without reservation. He had never seen the true Ning Yao on the battlefield before. As for the sword spirit that had taken him countless hardships to tame, which had a temperament as prickly as a nobleman, it now behaved like a sweet young girl in Ning Yao's hands, and he didn't mind one bit.

Ning Yao walked calmly forward, not in haste to strike the first blow. The sword in her hand shimmered with golden light, and her striking golden battle robe made her appear like a divine being walking among mortals on the battlefield.

Seizing the opportunity, Chen Ping'an communicated with Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo through his thoughts, inquiring about the battlefield details from their previous assaults. He asked for information on the high-ranking, uninjured demon cultivators at the Dragon Gate and Golden Core levels—their approximate numbers, appearances, and magical abilities. During their earlier retreat, Chen Ping'an had focused more on searching for the hidden sword cultivator death warriors, inevitably missing a substantial number of details.

Asking about Diezhang or Dong Huafu would have been fruitless; after all, they had been too busy fighting and dodging flying swords to keep track of their contributions.

Chen Ping'an quickly reminded everyone through his thoughts, "As we break through the enemy lines next, don't overly concern yourselves with killing enemies on the spot. I and Fan Dache will cover a few strikes; aside from Ning Yao breaking the formation, just focus on that. Sanqiu, for you four, the most important thing is to rely on large-scale 'friendly fire' to force the death warriors to reveal themselves. I'll clarify their identities and positions one by one. If the timing is right, feel free to act on your own. Fan Dache and I will adapt and follow up. If things get out of hand, listen for my reminders and adjust accordingly to aim for a joint kill."

Fan Dache was feeling somewhat anxious; after all, he worried about becoming a burden to his friends. However, after hearing Chen Ping'an's detailed battle arrangements, he felt a little more at ease.

"Dache," Chen Ping'an said to him, "how can the heroism that comes from a moment of heated impulse not be heroism?"

Fan Dache took a deep breath and replied with a smile, "That's true."

Now, Dong Huafu’s appearance was caught between that of a youth and a young man; he only had the wrong name given by his parents and none of the nicknames from his wandering friends. Dong Heitan (Dong Black Charcoal) was indeed a bit dark and would likely never shake off that nickname. He was known for his lavish spending and never borrowing anything.

He chose the sword named "Rouge," delicate in style and whimsical in design, with a blade as slender as a willow branch.

Diezhang held the "Zhenyu" sword, a one-armed shopkeeper whose graceful figure made her look like a strikingly beautiful woman, wielding a broad sword.

With the bloodlustiest Dong Huafu and Diezhang following closely behind Ning Yao, they aimed to assist her in tearing a larger hole in the demonic army.

If Ning Yao's sword strike determined the speed at which their group of sword cultivators could break the formation, then Diezhang and Dong Huafu had no small responsibility. If the overall killing power of their seven-person sword formation wasn’t overwhelming enough, even if they successfully penetrated the enemy's lines at top speed, their advancement toward the golden river where the sword spirit was stationed would ultimately hold minimal significance for the entire battlefield.

Positioned behind Diezhang and Dong Huafu were Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo, tasked with helping the former two secure the front line and eliminate more demons across the battlefield.

As the formation was about to open, Chen Ping'an gathered himself, his mind immersed. He kept his sword hovering just a few feet above the ground. While he might not be able to conceal his identity from certain death warrior sword cultivators, he had a hidden purpose. If those sword cultivators, seeking stability, alerted certain important demon cultivators outside the death warriors via their thoughts, then with just one or two careless glances toward the "young sword cultivator," Chen Ping'an would have the opportunity to identify one or two critical enemies.

To do great deeds, one must be meticulous.

As the six sword cultivators advanced, Chen Ping'an found himself unknowingly positioned at the very back of the battlefield and suddenly chuckled. Indeed, Ning Yao looked best in that golden robe.

As for the earlier disdain he had for the young master Pu Yu’s snow-white robe, that thought had completely slipped his mind.

Of course, Ning Yao, being on the battlefield, was not subject to any illusions; her sword friends were all younger geniuses from the same generation, and more importantly, Ning Yao’s swordplay was far too conspicuous.

After all, someone like Chen Ping'an, who advocated that skills should never weigh one down, would find it unnecessary to exert twice the effort to defeat an enemy when half would suffice. When he was ruthless, he was even willing to cover for a woman, pretending to be a demon's inside man, a rare sight indeed.

In the blink of an eye, Ning Yao flashed forward, covering dozens of yards in an instant, and swept her sword horizontally.

The front lines of the demonic army, spanning over a hundred yards, were severed in half by the golden sword light.

A Yuan Ying demon cultivator overseeing the battlefield issued commands from the rear and, using a spell, obliterated dozens of retreating demons who were already hesitant on the battlefield.

Ning Yao glided forward in a straight line, after delivering one strike, she was too disdainful to strike again. Instead, she relied on her overwhelming sword aura to forge a path, which, in its essence, resembled the highest sword arts. The sheer abundance of sword energy and overwhelming momentum created an indestructible mini realm of sword formations, making it so that whether she targeted an enemy depended on whether they were worthy of her attention.

The demon cultivators, reluctant and fearful, unleashed numerous spiritual artifacts and a few life treasures, wildly hurling them at her sword aura. Their concern for collateral damage among their own forces had long since vanished. They only hoped to wear down that unmatched sword aura, or else if they allowed Ning Yao to break through, their losses would be catastrophic, and their forces would dwindle rapidly. A grand war, sweeping and tumultuous, could yield results through sheer numbers, but in certain specific battlefields, that was not always the case.

Facing Ning Yao, there was no hope for such a consideration.

In any case, all they needed to do was regard Ning Yao as a sword immortal, regardless of her cultivation level.

Whether she was a Golden Core or a Yuan Ying sword cultivator was irrelevant.

This was a universally acknowledged truth between the Sword Qi Great Wall and the savage wilderness.

In an instant, Ning Yao traversed the battlefield littered with corpses. Wherever her sword aura touched, demons were pulverized, their souls shattered alongside them. Earlier life treasures and spiritual artifacts lay broken or fragmented, unable to impede her advance. With her single sword, she swiftly made her way into the heart of the demonic army. With one hand, she applied a gentle force to the sword spirit wrapped in golden light, and with her other hand, her fingers converging, she casually executed a sword art. The golden rays on the sword spirit exploded outward, and in a radius of several miles on the battlefield, except for the Golden Core cultivators who managed to escape in time, and those who fought with life treasures as shields, everyone else perished.

From a distance, Chen Ping'an observed this scene, as if a golden lotus had bloomed in his heart.

In another instant, Ning Yao shot several hundred yards away, targeting a Golden Core demon. With one sword strike down, she looked up and softly called, “Come here.”

The Golden Core demon, panicking as it commanded its troops, never expected such "good fortune" to face a sword strike alone. It immediately summoned a life treasure, an ancient weapon resembling a spear, inscribed with golden symbols. Gripping the weapon with both hands, the Golden Core demon spun it around, creating a faint golden circle of protective symbols, similar to a defensive array. Furthermore, a string of pale golden cloud-like glyphs wrapped around its body, providing an effect akin to a protective armor.

With the symbol array firmly guarding its front and an armor-like shield draped over it, the demon’s physique was already quite resilient. 

That treasure, both offensive and defensive, was undoubtedly a remarkable celestial artifact. In the heart of the righteous world, even a Yuan Ying cultivator would feel envy upon seeing it.

Sadly, as the golden line fell from above, the symbol array, the golden armor, and the Golden Core demon cultivator were all cleaved in two.

The ground was carved by that astonishing golden line, creating a long ravine.

The breaking of the symbol array, the golden armor, and the demon’s body—all were mere consequences of Ning Yao's casual sword strike.

When Ning Yao paused slightly, revealing herself on the battlefield, the surrounding demonic army had already begun to retreat frantically. However, when she casually uttered the words "come here," an extraordinary phenomenon unfolded.

Around Ning Yao, four strands of ancient pure sword intent roamed the heavens and the earth, as if summoned by her command, they all descended straight to the ground. The originally fleeting sword intent suddenly gained life and spirit, not only summoned forth for the first time by a junior sword cultivator from the Sword Qi Great Wall, but also able to absorb the abundant sword energy from the world. The four strands of exquisite sword intent reached high into the clouds and deep into the earth, continuously expanding like grand columns of a great hall.

In the end, four mighty pillars of sword intent connected the heavens and the earth.

Instantly, countless thin strands of sword intent branched out, weaving through the entire realm.

This time, not a single person remained alive on the battlefield around Ning Yao, and all the demonic army was reduced to a pulp, their bodies and souls, along with the cultivators' life treasures and weapons, utterly obliterated.

Ning Yao once again surged forward, creating a significant distance between her and the sword cultivators behind her. 

The four strands of sword intent converged once more into a singular line, shadowing Ning Yao's movements.

Thus, Ning Yao, outside the grand sword formation, was also surrounded by sword intent. 

The gold sword in her hand had few places to wield its power.

Even Fan Dache, witnessing this scene from afar, felt a chill run down his spine. 

If Lin Junbi had the chance to see this, he would likely congratulate himself for having lost honorably, feeling nothing but joy instead of sadness.

In the path of swords, losing to Ning Yao held no shame whatsoever.

If one didn't believe it, they could ask Pang Yuanji, Qi Shou, and Gao Yehou if they had the capability to summon Ning Yao to personally strike.

Looking back, before Ning Yao became a Golden Core sword cultivator, she had likely been on the battlefield primarily for her own training and to slay enemies, while trying to ensure her friends' safety as best she could. 

However, after returning from the righteous world and three battles later, it seemed like she was only helping Diezhang and Chen Sanqiu practice their swordplay.

She appeared to have no sword left to practice.

Far behind Ning Yao, the battlefield was desolate; some smaller demon cultivators and those still vestigial in intelligence were easily dispatched by Diezhang and Dong Huafu, who were trying their best to keep up with Ning Yao.

Dong Huafu even had the leisure to scratch his head, muttering softly, “Sister Ning, at least leave some for us, would you?”

Diezhang executed a swift turn and hurled her weapon, the Zhenyu, directly killing a demon cultivator at the Sea-View stage. With a wave of her hand, she left her sword unfurled, her toes lightly touching the ground as she flew toward Ning Yao, closer to the southern sword intent. She and Dong Huafu were still over a hundred yards away.

Turning her head in complaint, she said, “What are you grumbling about? Keep up! Otherwise, we won’t even see Ning Yao’s back soon.”

Diezhang certainly did not complain about Ning Yao; she was just venting at Dong Huafu, which was no problem at all.

Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo had even less to do than Diezhang and Dong Huafu.

Chen Sanqiu, being naturally laid-back, didn’t mind being in this awkward position where there were no enemies to slay. Yan Zhuo, however, was a bit concerned but felt helpless.

Fan Dache simply focused on propelling his sword forward.

At the very back, Chen Ping'an merely took a slightly longer route with his sword, wandering around, making minimal gains.

In fact, Chen Ping'an was the most helpless. It seemed that watching the battlefield made no difference; whether he looked or not, the results were the same. The few clues he had painstakingly uncovered either fled in panic or were too slow and ended up dead before he could even speak. However, it wasn't entirely meaningless, as he was too far from Ning Yao, so he planned to use his thoughts to communicate with Chen Sanqiu, hoping to relay a warning to Dong Huafu that a demon cultivator with at least Golden Core or even Yuan Ying cultivation was hiding and about to attack.

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to speak, 

Ning Yao, continuously breaking through the enemy lines, finally paused again on the distant battlefield. Leaning on her sword spirit, she pressed the sword's hilt lightly, and the golden long sword instantly sank into the earth, disappearing from sight.

Clearly, she had sensed the sneaky movements of that Yuan Ying demon.

The ground beneath her feet cracked, and her golden long sword was the first to greet the enemy. Nearby sword energy poured down like torrential rain, rapidly infiltrating the earth. She couldn’t be bothered to spend time precisely locating the hiding demon cultivator.

She cast a glance at a few relatively high-ranking demon cultivators on the edge of the "sword array" and said indifferently, “Come again.”

Again, four strands of ancient sword intent, which countless sword cultivators had brushed past over the millennia, manifested in response to the two words spoken by this young woman.

In addition to the previous four strands, a total of eight strands of ancient sword energy enveloped Ning Yao, forming a more substantial sword formation.

Inside this formation, casualties were innumerable.

Even so, Ning Yao still felt it wasn’t enough.

With her fingers forming an ancient sword art, her thoughts stirred, and the eight strands of sword intent seemed to coalesce into flesh and blood, with sword intent as their framework, magically conjuring up eight pale-robed sword spirits. These eight sword spirits, each with a cold demeanor, wearing flowing white robes and towering several meters high, extended their hands, each gripping a long sword formed from the surrounding sword energy, and simultaneously turned to scatter in all directions to kill.

These ancient "sword spirits," devoid of intelligence, could not return to peak condition, but their combat power was equivalent to Golden Core sword cultivators. They also lacked life swords and magical abilities. 

However, the power of eight Golden Core sword cultivators, even if destroyed by the savage world’s demon army, was merely a matter of reconsolidating the battlefield’s sword energy. They would persist, tireless and unyielding, with no need to worry about spiritual energy accumulation, making it easy to wreak havoc on the battlefield. As long as Ning Yao's mental energy didn’t deplete excessively, combined with the eight pure sword intents as the "fundamentals of the Dao," and without being forcibly interrupted by enemy Yuan Ying sword cultivators or upper-level sword immortals, these eight ancient sword spirits could persist on the battlefield indefinitely.

“Ning Yao’s swordsmanship, sword intent, and sword Dao, as long as she is given time—and it doesn’t even need to be long—all three can reach great heights.” 

This was what the senior sword immortal Chen Qingdu himself had said.

Why was it that no one in the Sword Qi Great Wall, which boasted a plethora of sword cultivator geniuses, ever called her a genius? Because if she were to be labeled a genius, then Qi Shou, Pang Yuanji, and the rest of that young sword cultivator group would all have to downgrade their status, not even qualifying as geniuses.

Ning Yao.

Always one of a kind.

From the day Ning Yao first picked up a sword in her youth, there had been no peers, even those a generation above her, willing to spar with her, let alone exchange sword arts.

There was simply no need.

The ground where Ning Yao previously stood had already crumbled and collapsed.

Ning Yao hung suspended in mid-air, turning to glance back, likely checking if Diezhang and Dong Huafu were following.

In just a few blinks, when the Yuan Ying cultivator was located by the golden long sword, Ning Yao plummeted rapidly, disappearing from view.

By the time Diezhang and Dong Huafu reached the edge of the large pit, Ning Yao had already revealed herself at the southernmost part of the pit and continued southward to open up the formation.

She had already located a Jade Purity realm death warrior.

However, the opponent surprisingly chose to retreat without a fight.

Facing south, Ning Yao raised her hand to wipe away a faint scar on her face from a blade, merely a scratch.

Diezhang glanced into the depths of the pit, where a Yuan Ying demon had revealed its true form—a colossal monkey, seemingly a remnant of ancient mountain-moving creatures. Its demise could likely be described as being torn apart, with remnants of golden sword energy still lingering in the gaps of its corpse.

It was evident that it had been slain by the sword spirit in Ning Yao's hands, without even having the chance to self-destruct.

At the bottom of the pit, beside the corpse, there hovered a narrow white knife, which appeared like a delicate needle compared to the massive body. Its blade shimmered erratically, quite eye-catching.

Dong Huafu was about to descend to retrieve the treasure.

However, Diezhang shot him an incredulous glare. “Are you stupid?”

Dong Huafu exclaimed, “Oh!” and quickly followed Diezhang southward.

Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo followed the edge of the pit, moving southward as well. Their life swords and companion swords were primarily used to collect a few battle merits from the side battlefield, making the most of the situation so as not to appear utterly useless. They were like farmers gathering scattered grains, yet even now, their bowl still had not filled.

Fan Dache felt a bit lost.

Wasn’t the plan for me to be the bait?

Arriving at the southern end of the pit, Fan Dache looked back to see the second shopkeeper squatting there picking up scraps, her movements surprisingly graceful.

Since Fan Dache was closest to Chen Ping'an, he realized that even though he was the bait, being slightly distracted wouldn’t hurt. He knew that the second shopkeeper, as she moved southward, was accumulating small gains. She hadn’t missed a single piece of broken spiritual artifact or life treasure fragment, which still made for a considerable quantity. By the time she finished scouring the pit, she likely would have secured some quality treasures.

Chen Ping'an left the pit, feeling complicated emotions. It didn’t seem right to be scavenging like this.

It appeared that the demon sword cultivator death warriors had lost the courage to strike.

Chen Ping'an could only remind Chen Sanqiu and Yan Zhuo through thoughts, “We probably can’t keep up. Let’s find an opportunity to eliminate the already identifiable Golden Core demons. If there are Yuan Ying ones, we’ll work together to intercept them and prevent them from slipping to other battlefields.”

Unexpectedly, Ning Yao to the far south, one step ahead, had stopped the ancient sword spirit from slaughtering the demons on the north-south battlefield, instead beginning to hunt for those attempting to escape to the sides. Once she discovered them, she would slow her pace southward, wielding the sword spirit, and pursue them.

The Jade Purity realm sword cultivator death warrior seemed exceptionally adept at hiding, much like Lord Nalan. Ning Yao didn’t ponder much and simply avoided it.

In this way, Diezhang and Dong Huafu finally caught up with Ning Yao.

Chen Ping'an scratched his head.

Then, this group of sword cultivators proceeded southward.

It seemed the demon death warriors had initially hoped that Ning Yao would eventually show signs of mental exhaustion, but they could never have predicted that she would maintain her forward momentum, breaking through the lines without any signs of fatigue or depletion of spiritual energy.

Also, the two Golden Core death warriors and a Yuan Ying demon cultivator were subsequently slain, with Ning Yao personally dealing with the Yuan Ying, while the two injured Golden Cores were left to Diezhang and the others to handle.

Ning Yao couldn’t even be bothered to pretend, disdainful of luring her enemies into action.

I can find you.

And then, you can die.

This was the essence of Ning Yao’s sword strikes.

In stark contrast to that infamous second shopkeeper, the two were completely different styles on the battlefield.

And just like that, they continued southward.

As they neared the golden river, a sword immortal greeted Ning Yao with a smile.

Ning Yao nodded in acknowledgment to the senior sword immortal.

Finally, Ning Yao came to a halt, and for the first time, the seven sword cultivators gathered together.

Ning Yao looked toward Chen Ping'an and asked, “Shall we head back? Diezhang and the four of you can switch to another battlefield, while the three of us—me, you, and Fan Dache—will take a different route. Does that sound good?”

Chen Ping'an smiled, “What’s there to disagree with?”

Diezhang and Chen Sanqiu’s group headed toward another battlefield, turning north back to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

On this journey, aside from some minor skirmishes, it seemed like no one had to draw their swords; having no swords to draw was also awkward.

Ning Yao accompanied Chen Ping'an and Fan Dache, the three of them returning north to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Fan Dache felt increasingly redundant.

Chen Ping'an ceased to wield his sword, stowing his sword from the forge on his back and shaking his sleeves.

Fan Dache was the first to soar northward, yet he dared not create too much distance between himself and the two behind him.

Chen Ping'an even omitted the words “Dache,” realizing that after more than a year apart, Fan Dache had matured quite a bit. It was no wonder he had reached the Golden Core stage; he must have drunk his fill at the Bamboo Sea cave.

After Fan Dache had taken his leave, Ning Yao suddenly asked, “Is being an Hidden Official tiring?”

Chen Ping'an chuckled, “Not so much right now.”

Ning Yao hesitated for a moment, feeling somewhat awkward, but still softly voiced her feelings: “When you’re with me, you can think less.”

Then Ning Yao raised an eyebrow.

This was the truth. 

What was there to be embarrassed about?

Chen Ping'an turned, raised his hand, and gently brushed the scar on her face with his thumb, then pinched her cheek, smiling softly, “Who says otherwise?” 

**(End of Chapter)**

 ### Chapter 763: Breaking Through Casually

Previously, when Ning Yao set out alone intending to breach the formation first, the frontline of the demon army was stalled. By the time she cut through their ranks and led six sword cultivators to the vicinity of the Golden River, the demon forces on both sides of the battlefield hastily advanced, trying to stay as far away as possible from this woman, the "Sword Immortal," whose strikes were too fierce.

In that moment, Ning Yao resembled a commanding officer, urging the demon army to fight desperately onward.

Thus, Fan Dache, having left the two of them first, found himself inexplicably transformed into a Golden Core sword cultivator, chasing after the vast demon army all alone. 

Fan Dache thought that given this situation, he should treat himself to the finest wine from Qing Shen Mountain when it was all over. His achievements in battle were enough for him to finally stop borrowing money from Chen Sanqiu to buy alcohol.

Chen Ping'an glanced at the battlefield ahead. The formation of the demon army was growing denser and more compact, advancing rapidly. The higher-ranked demon cultivators were increasingly distancing themselves from the three of them, primarily to avoid Ning Yao alone, with both he and Fan Dache in tow.

He said, “The pressure on the sword cultivators on both sides will increase significantly because of us.”

Ning Yao replied, “Then let’s strive to meet the sword cultivators at the front as soon as possible. Specifically, how shall we proceed?”

Standing atop the sword from the Sword Workshop, Chen Ping'an was becoming more accustomed to flying close to the ground. He quickly rolled up his sleeves and said, “This time, I’ll lead the formation, and you’ll cover me from the back. If any Golden Core or Nascent Soul demons appear, it will be your responsibility to handle them.”

Ning Yao asked, “Aren’t you planning to summon your flying sword?”

“I’ll rely solely on my fists. It’s just right for polishing my martial arts bottleneck,” Chen Ping'an said. “Don’t worry, my speed in breaking through the formation won’t compare to yours, but compared to other battlefields, it won’t be slow.”

Ning Yao nodded, “Then just focus on throwing punches.”

Taking a deep breath, Chen Ping'an maneuvered the sword like a bolt of lightning, following Fan Dache closely, speaking to him via thought, “Dache, you attack from the center while I lead the formation. During this time, regardless of what happens, just focus on advancing with your sword. I might not be able to take care of you too much, but with Ning Yao covering us, it shouldn’t be a problem.”

Fan Dache replied solemnly, “Understood!”

In truth, the moment the second shopkeeper didn’t utter his usual “Dache” was when Fan Dache realized he needed to be extra cautious.

In an instant, Chen Ping'an, dressed in two layers of official robes, accelerated on his sword, cutting through the air in a straight line.

As he flew, when still over a hundred feet away from the demon army, Chen Ping'an had already adjusted his stance, one foot firmly planted. The sword beneath him tilted downward, unable to bear the weight, and transformed into a true ground-skimming flight. To Fan Dache’s astonishment, Chen Ping'an's figure vanished in an instant; he hadn’t even used the Earth-Shrinking Talisman but had achieved its effect. Could it be that after just over a year of reaching the Golden Body realm, he had broken through again, becoming a Master of the Wandering Realm?

Ning Yao chose to fly on her sword and explained to Fan Dache, “He’s still only at the Golden Body realm and hasn’t reached the Wandering Realm. Wearing three layers of robes isn’t merely for protection; it’s to suppress his fist intent. Coupled with a certain degree of sword qi pressure, the three elements reinforce each other, serving as a form of training. It’s similar to how those martial artists in the Jianghu bind sandbags to their feet.”

Ning Yao was willing to elaborate on this, of course, because it was related to Chen Ping'an. Furthermore, Fan Dache was a mutual friend of hers and Chen Ping'an, and Chen Ping'an had taken care of Fan Dache the most. It wasn’t solely because of Fan Dache’s insufficient cultivation level; it was as if in Fan Dache, Chen Ping'an could see many fragments of his own past years. Piecing them together naturally made him feel particularly close to him.

However, the specific reasons behind this were beyond Ning Yao’s comprehension. She believed that when Chen Ping'an had the time, or when the Hidden Official finally found a moment of respite amidst his busy schedule, he would surely share them with her.

Ning Yao continued, “When he first started learning martial arts back in his hometown, he tied bags filled with gravel to his legs. During his first journey, he used half a jiao talisman and an eight-ounce talisman. He has long been accustomed to this, and he himself doesn’t know how heavy or fast his punches are. Since he doesn’t know how hard he can hit, then neither will his opponents.”

As she spoke, Ning Yao swung her sword, and a Golden Core demon cultivator from another battlefield glanced her way. Sensing her presence, she unleashed her sword qi. After just one strike, she cut through the demon cultivator’s body cleanly, splitting him in half. A Golden Core exploded, causing collateral damage to countless others.

Ning Yao recalled a small incident from the past. She remembered when a young Chen Ping'an came to the Sword Qi Great Wall for the first time, carrying a Huai wood sword box with two swords inside. During their moments alone, he enjoyed making small talk, sharing many tales from the countryside, such as how an artisan would pluck ink lines with great precision.

Ning Yao stole a glance at the battlefield after her strike; it resembled that memory.

Fan Dache had no idea how to strike up a conversation. Standing beside Ning Yao, he felt an immense pressure—something unimaginable. His good friend, Chen Sanqiu, had privately told him that when he and his friends like Diezhang were at a lower realm than Ning Yao, he felt fine. But once they were at the same realm, he genuinely questioned his existence. Am I really a sword cultivator? Is my cultivation level even real?

Yet, Fan Dache had watched Chen Sanqiu leisurely sipping wine and complaining, all the while sporting a smile.

The second shopkeeper had once said that wine was the best fishing rod in the world, able to reel in the heartfelt confessions of drunkards, especially the Bamboo Sea Cave wine from his establishment, which was even more extraordinary.

Being able to befriend Ning Yao, even someone as gifted as Chen Sanqiu would feel pressure but still find joy in drinking.

Fan Dache remained vigilant, watching the surroundings of the battlefield, which seemed empty and devoid of immediate danger. Still, he worried that some sneaky demon cultivator might stab him from underground or drop a magical artifact on him.

Such occurrences were numerous on the battlefield.

Fan Dache had once witnessed a fellow sword cultivator of exceptional talent being caught off guard by a Mountain-moving demon cultivator, who had calculated the trajectory of his sword and burst forth from the ground, seizing the sword cultivator’s ankles and tearing him apart.

On the battlefield, the most terrifying enemies were often not the powerful demons who were at a bottleneck, crushing a particular battlefield with their might. Unless it was a life-or-death situation, one could easily avoid their sharpness. What was even more daunting were the demon cultivators who initially sought not for accomplishments but for refining their skills. They acted insidiously, adept at disguise, always aiming for a lethal strike, killing invisibly. If they missed, they would promptly retreat. Such demon cultivators thrived on the battlefield, living longer and stealthily drifting through various battlefields, accumulating impressive war achievements.

It was said that the youngest Sword Immortal of the Upper Five Realms in the Wildlands, a demon named Shou Chen, had risen step by step using such underhanded tactics.

What was even more terrifying was that even after becoming a Sword Immortal of the Upper Five Realms, Shou Chen still preferred to act stealthily, concealing his demonic aura and intentionally suppressing his Sword Immortal demeanor, pretending to be a Golden Core demon cultivator to remain on the battlefield, waiting for the right moment to strike.

Because of this, Ah Liang had once personally sought Shou Chen’s whereabouts during a battle and ultimately found him, managing to send a sword from a distance. However, Shou Chen was a Sword Immortal, and at that time, he had used a protective talisman from his mentor, allowing him to escape the battlefield.

Fan Dache suddenly froze.

Wasn’t his second shopkeeper just like this? He could even be considered a master of this craft?

What a pity he became the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Otherwise, even if the second shopkeeper didn’t act as Fan Dache’s guardian sword master, letting Chen Ping'an roam freely across battlefields, he would still be a pure martial artist. Coupled with Chen Ping'an’s keen understanding of the battlefield and precise calculations regarding the strengths of enemies and allies, he believed that whether in accumulating war achievements or growth speed, he wouldn’t be any inferior to that Shou Chen demon.

Ning Yao’s Sword Immortal demeanor was certainly breathtaking and captivating.

However, no matter how much one revered or admired her, Ning Yao was simply Ning Yao. No one among her peers at the Sword Qi Great Wall could replicate her.

Yet, the second shopkeeper’s style of combat was something even Fan Dache could learn. As long as one was willing, witnessing it firsthand, listening more, observing more, and remembering, one could incorporate it into their own practice. Even a slight increase in odds on the battlefield could often help a sword cultivator eliminate unforeseen threats.

Ahead on the battlefield, Chen Ping'an had ceased using his sword and actively plunged into the thick encirclement of demons.

With his fists wide open, an overwhelming intent surged forth like a river, reminiscent of the small realm that Ning Yao had previously established with her sword qi.

Anyone who accidentally or daringly approached would find themselves facing his fist intent.

A large demon, naturally robust as a gazebo, had become a cultivator and possessed two personal artifacts specifically for enhancing defensive magical techniques. Relying on its innate strength, it rampaged across the battlefield.

Yet, it was directly cut in half by Chen Ping'an as he forged a path with his punch, a torrent of blood being scattered outward.

Striking a thousand times may not be as effective as one decisive blow.

Chen Ping'an engaged in combat with just a single punch.

Trapped in the enemy’s encirclement, surrounded on all sides by foes.

He still aimed for a single punch to kill, to injure their foundation, shatter their souls.

Each punch seemed to save energy, yet every strike was immensely powerful, pushing forward without hesitation. His pure fist intent subtly caused the surrounding sword qi to avoid him.

A demon cultivator unable to evade—a towering figure, two zhang tall—swung a massive hammer down at him.

Facing the legendary Ning Yao may have meant certain death, but against this “young man” who had no flying sword and relied solely on his exceptional fist techniques, he at least possessed the heart to fight.

Chen Ping'an extended his hand to block the incoming hammer, his entire form enveloped in shadow. He shifted his ankle slightly, redirecting the immense force into the ground. Even so, the impact caused his knees to sink into the earth.

He could have evaded but chose not to, deliberately withstanding the heavy blow, all to entice the hidden demon cultivators around him into believing they had an opportunity.

A demon cultivator clad in fine iron armor approached Chen Ping'an with a blade, exuding might as he swung down.

Additionally, a Golden Core cultivator emerged from his sleeve, tossing out two golden talismans adorned with images of the Five Peaks and winding rivers, then raised a hand, lifting them high.

The ground beneath Chen Ping'an’s feet was first encased in ice by the Golden Core cultivator’s technique, sealing off a radius of several dozen zhang.

The golden mountain talismans materialized into five vividly colored mountains, each the size of a fist. Four of them hovered beside the young martial artist, while only one of the talismans targeted his head.

With one hand anchored against the hammer, Chen Ping'an raised his left hand, seizing the thick black blade, its filth as dense as ink. The pure fist intent in his palm clashed with the black blade’s brilliance, sparks flying.

With a twist of his wrist, he yanked the unwilling cultivator forward, colliding him with the miniature mountain created by the talisman.

The hammer-wielding demon, having already completed his role as bait, found himself unable to strike down with his weapon any further. He momentarily withdrew, raising his arm high for another attempt.

The martial artist demon, sensing the ill fate, sought escape, unwilling to be struck by the oncoming mountain or suffer injury from the hammer, decisively kicked Chen Ping'an in the chest to gain distance.

In the next moment, Chen Ping'an, who had been employing the Zhu Lian-style monkey fist stance, suddenly transformed into the peak stance of Zong Qiu, his previously relaxed shoulders and hunched back straightening to normal as he regained his composure. With his fist intent thickening, he shattered the surrounding spell seals with a single punch, smashing the miniature mountain to radiant golden splinters.

Still holding onto the blade near its tip, Chen Ping'an slipped back, evading the second heavy hammer strike from the hulking demon.

With his left hand retracting the blade slightly, his right fist opened to form a palm knife, slashing down to forcefully sever the black blade in two. This caused the demon cultivator, who had aimed to destroy his own offensive artifact, to instead injure himself, spitting out a mouthful of blood. He cast a glance at the young man still surrounded by the four mountains created by the talismans, and the martial artist cultivator fled, riding the wind away from the battlefield.

The four golden mountain talismans, though small, retained an impressive aura as they hovered in the air, forming a powerful formation that encircled Chen Ping'an and the hammer-wielding demon, though lacking a central mountain, creating a slight deficiency.

Fortunately, another golden talisman had transformed into a water serpent several zhang long, ultimately establishing the layout of mountains and flowing waters.

The hulking demon, now forced to fight for his life against the young man, lost all fear of death on the battlefield, ready to trade blows if necessary.

With the massive hammer in hand, the fierce demon charged at the young man with unreasonable strength, fully intending to exchange his life for the young man's.

In the end, the young man’s punch shattered the demon's chest cavity. Prior to that, the talisman serpent had already battered the hulking demon to the point of being unrecognizable. This outcome likely caught even the Golden Core demon cultivator off guard, culminating in a mutual downfall, for after Chen Ping'an struck the demon down, he leapt high, pressing the hulking demon’s head against the serpent, choosing to obliterate the Golden Core demon along with the serpent, reducing them to ashes.

The Golden Core cultivator observed as the young man tore off his tattered robe, revealing yet another robe beneath it. 

His face, too, was battered beyond recognition, and the young man casually gathered it into his sleeve, even making the large hammer vanish, storing it within his pocket dimension.

The Golden Core cultivator wasted no time, disregarding the four mountain talismans entirely as he executed a unique technique, transforming into several wisps of green smoke that darted underground, fleeing in all directions.

Chen Ping'an did not intentionally pursue the Golden Core cultivator. The loss of one robe only invigorated his fist intent further, and he pushed the teetering four miniature mountains away, charging forward as he sent out four punches, unleashing four bursts of golden light, resulting in nearly a hundred demon casualties on the battlefield. 

Without faces to conceal their identities, the demon army was the first to cry out “Hidden Official,” and the forces, which had been trying to regroup under the previous supervision, scattered in disarray.

As Chen Ping'an continued breaking through, his path was no longer a straight line but rather a large circle on the battlefield, slightly off-centered as he advanced. The faster they fled, the more punches he unleashed.

With the pure energy of a martial artist flowing through him, he continued to punch until exhaustion nearly overtook him, looking for a moment to catch his breath; if the situation grew dire, he would fight through it.

On the battlefield, as he faced ten realms of martial artists, could anyone match the weight of his fists? Dealing with the latter was truly a matter of life and death; the so-called resilience of the body was like paper against the fists of a peak ninth realm martial artist.

He could only rely on intuition, instinct, and the bond with his fellow martial artists as he fought.

For Chen Ping'an, as long as there weren’t any hidden Nascent Soul sword cultivators lurking nearby, the so-called one-man encirclement wasn’t a battlefield at all; it had always been a matter of matching opponents.

Li Er once said that during a duel where he almost accidentally killed Song Changjing, that prince of the Great Li had talent, of course, but his punches were still too light at that time. The reason Song Changjing managed to endure for so long was because he wasn’t merely a martial artist; he was a warrior forged in the fires of battle. Having honed his fist techniques on the battlefield for so long, he naturally exuded an aura of “one man against a thousand.”

Now, Chen Ping'an found himself in battle, seeking the first layer of that aura. With mountains and rivers before him, how many could truly match him?

As long as his punches were heavy enough, his movements swift enough, and his eyes keen enough, he would merely tread through the water and over the mountains, slowly progressing through each encounter.

After that, driven by a surge of excitement, Chen Ping'an became increasingly pure in his movements, whether walking or flying. He continuously adopted the six-step stance, his punches embodying the essence of the Iron Cavalry Charge, Divine Beating of Drums, and Cloud-Forming Great Marsh.

Though Li Er was a tenth realm martial artist, he had said little about fist theory during their time training at the ruins of the Lion Peak. When he occasionally spoke, he was straightforward, attributing his understanding to the frequent musings of Zheng Dafeng. He told Chen Ping'an that these words might be useful for him, but such discussions of fist theory lacked weight and couldn’t suppress anyone.

Among those words was the idea that one must have an enemy in sight to strike, while an absence of enemies in mind led to a transcendent state. The ultimate fist technique is omnipresent, seamlessly integrated with the laws of martial arts, and free from obstruction.

This time, as Chen Ping'an led the formation, he wouldn’t mercilessly slaughter the roaring, fierce demons, nor would he show restraint against the young demon cultivators filled with fear and pleading eyes.

A pure martial artist simply throws punches.

Those of higher technique live; those with lighter punches die.

On the battlefield, Chen Ping'an’s expression was solemn, his gaze indifferent.

Ning Yao merely reminded Fan Dache with one sentence, “Stay away from him.”

Chen Ping'an’s thoughts grew fewer, as all prior considerations faded away, drawing ever closer to the state of “forgetting oneself” that Li Er described.

He didn’t use the Earth-Shrinking Talisman, nor did he employ the Initial and Full Moons techniques. He didn’t even summon his Pine Needle or Thunder, which could anchor his form.

As for his two main flying swords, Cage Bird and Well Bottom Moon, they were of great use, and he would never reveal them prematurely.

At that moment, Chen Ping'an had completely forgotten that he was a sword cultivator, possessing four flying swords, and even two main flying swords.

At the thickest point of the demon army’s formation, his presence had not yet arrived, but his fist intent was already there.

Ning Yao continued searching for those high-level Golden Core and Nascent Soul demons.

Fan Dache still found himself with little to do. Fortunately, compared to when Ning Yao had led the formation, everyone simply followed her on their swords. This time, as Chen Ping'an led with his fists, Fan Dache found more opportunities to strike.

Earlier, with Ning Yao wielding her sword, the formation had been too swift.

The sword cultivators on the north and south battle lines were still far from the Golden River, not even halfway through their assault. As they progressed, the speed of breaking formations and killing enemies would only slow down further, and it was highly likely that they would need to retreat before reaching halfway, returning to the Sword Qi Great Wall to regroup with the second wave of sword cultivators, who rested atop the walls, ready to take turns in this grueling war of attrition.

In the vast battlefield between the Golden River and the city walls, the fastest group of sword cultivators advancing southward had barely reached the halfway mark, thanks to the assistance of the Nascent Soul sword cultivator Qi Shou.

Diezhang and his three companions were heading back north, engaging in a gruesome battle with the demon army alongside a dozen sword cultivators from the southern line.

The four young genius sword cultivators stood in a row, keeping a distance of seventy to eighty zhang apart. They no longer pursued speed or depth in breaching the formation but began to inflict as much damage as possible on the demon army. Thus, each sword cultivator began to step onto their swords: Zhen Yue, Hong Zhuang, Jing Shu, and Zi Dian, summoning their respective main flying swords, making their way back to the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Chen Sanqiu’s main flying sword was named “White Deer.” One of its innate abilities was the appearance of a great white deer, as large as a house, carrying spirit mushrooms in its mouth. On the battlefield, a white deer shimmering like snow would appear, gathering spirit energy, showcasing remarkable powers.

On the battlefield, that massive, snow-white deer wreaked havoc, its killing power immense.

It was said that before Chen Sanqiu had forged his main flying sword, he had a dream one afternoon in which a doe knelt before him in submission, willingly recognizing him as its master.

Thus, Chen Sanqiu was renowned among the younger generation of the Sword Qi Great Wall, and it was no surprise.

With a good family background, a pleasant demeanor, good looks, great interpersonal relationships, and excellent potential, the only drawback was that Chen Sanqiu’s drinking habits were somewhat poor; otherwise, one could hardly find fault with him.

Moreover, the White Deer, an extraordinary creature, was often linked to ethereal literary fortunes. Therefore, the ancient sword “Jing Shu,” which Chen Sanqiu possessed, complemented him well. Because his main flying sword was one of the rare few possessing dual innate abilities, besides summoning the white deer, it could also invisibly enhance Chen Sanqiu’s literary fortune. Thus, Chen Sanqiu was not only a natural sword talent but also inherently a scholar.

It’s worth noting that in the Haoran world, there were only two Confucian saints with Sword Immortal status among the three major academies and seventy-two schools.

Unfortunately, Chen Sanqiu was born in the Sword Qi Great Wall, where scholars were few and far between. The most critical factor was that Chen Sanqiu’s surname was Chen, preventing him from going to that foreign land filled with schools and the sound of books.

Every sword cultivator who could earn the title of genius at the Sword Qi Great Wall had their story.

As long as they were sword cultivators who enjoyed drinking, anyone could get drunk, even to the point of dying, and have their reasons.

Ning Yao kept a distance, neither too far nor too close, following Chen Ping'an, who was solely focused on throwing punches.

Ning Yao vaguely sensed a thought from Chen Ping'an, perhaps something he himself was oblivious to at that moment.

If my fists soar high into the heavens, anyone who stands against me, Chen Ping'an, on the battlefield south of the Sword Qi Great Wall won’t need to draw their swords; they will all perish.

Ning Yao didn’t think this was a bad thing, but she also felt it might not be the best. The reason was simple: he was Chen Ping'an.

So Ning Yao called out, “Chen Ping'an.”

On the battlefield, Chen Ping'an immediately ceased his punches and paused, turning his head in confusion.

Fan Dache felt a momentary destabilization in his sword heart, a strange sensation that flitted away.

Ning Yao said, “Keep throwing punches; I’ll be right behind you.”

Chen Ping'an hesitated, unsure why Ning Yao would say that, but he nodded with a smile.

The robe he had borrowed from Pang Yuanji had already been shredded and put away, and this one had been damaged to the point of being unnecessary to fold away. He simply dispersed it with his fist intent, watching it scatter like dandelion fluff.

Not only that, but he also stored away the green shirt robe from the Ning family, leaving him now clad in merely the most ordinary long robe.

Chen Ping'an took a deep breath, expelling a mouthful of congealed blood. Unbeknownst to him, within a radius of several dozen zhang around him, there were no living demons left on the battlefield.

He shook his wrist and lightly clenched and relaxed his fists. His hands, now bare of skin, felt entirely normal. The pain was natural, but this familiar sensation brought him a sense of reassurance.

What’s the point of practicing martial arts or honing skills without feeling a bit of pain?

Chen Ping'an gazed into the distance, lifting his eyes, only to discover the large character carved on the city wall—familiar beyond recognition.

**Fierce.**

The character was poorly written.

Instinctively, Chen Ping'an looked up at the sky.

It can arrive late, but just don’t fail to arrive.

Even if it’s just to return to the Sword Qi Great Wall, half of my hometown, and take a look, as for whether to draw swords, we can decide after they come.

Chen Ping'an reached out to grab but remembered that the sword from the Sword Workshop had already shattered.

So he took out the法刀 of the Mountain-moving demon from the pocket dimension, slim and sharp, with a bright and pure treasure light.

Gripping this unclaimed法刀, a top-tier treasure, he weighed it lightly. If it was heavy enough, then he would continue leading the formation.

A moment later, Fan Dache couldn’t help but turn to look behind him.

Ning Yao was rubbing her temples.

In front of the two, Chen Ping'an was wielding his blade in a frenzy.

Fan Dache thought this must be akin to robbing a thief.

In an instant, Ning Yao shot out a sword.

It wasn’t to rescue Chen Ping'an; even if the attacker was a hidden Nascent Soul sword cultivator.

And the one coordinating the assassination against Ning Yao was precisely that earlier mysterious Jade Purity Realm Sword Immortal.

In the case of ordinary mountain deity companions, if a higher realm cultivator were to choose, even if they wouldn’t save a lower realm one, there would inevitably be some hesitation.

Yet Ning Yao had no such thoughts; her sword heart grew ever clearer and brighter.

She could kill her enemies, but she could also stay alive.

Ning Yao believed in herself, and she believed in Chen Ping'an.

Having intentionally suppressed her breakthrough at the Golden Core bottleneck for many years, Ning Yao now casually crossed into the Nascent Soul bottleneck.

After Ning Yao struck, she could still spare a glance at the city wall.

Chen Qingdu stood atop the wall, hands clasped behind him, a smile on his face.

Beside him, Wei Jin chuckled bitterly, “Why does the elder Sword Immortal intentionally suppress Ning Yao’s breakthrough?”

Chen Qingdu laughed, “There’s no rush. No need to compete for those superficial titles. Does it matter to become the first Sword Immortal under thirty in history?”

Wei Jin, who became a Sword Immortal at forty, still couldn’t comprehend, “Ning Yao isn’t forcing her growth; she is naturally progressing. Elder Sword Immortal, why would you use the entire Sword Qi Great Wall’s sword path to suppress her at the Nascent Soul bottleneck?”

Chen Qingdu replied with a grin, “Am I Wei Jin?”

Wei Jin was left speechless.

He started to reminisce about the times spent with his predecessors on the wall.

The implication in the elder Sword Immortal’s words was that you are the real Chen Qingdu?

Chen Qingdu continued, “Suppressing the sword path? You underestimate Ning Yao too much.”

The gray-clad elder from the Wildlands, regardless of how fierce the battle was, remained indifferent, meditating within the military tent.

At this moment, the elder opened his eyes, directly engaging Chen Qingdu with a smile, “Now, that’s breaking the rules.”

Chen Qingdu responded, “Not satisfied? Come up to the wall and have a go?”

(End of Chapter)

 ### Chapter 764: Kindred Spirits

On the other end of the Gengzi ledger, there was no response. Chen Qingdu's expression turned somewhat regretful. After all, the entire wilderness world was under the influence of that old fellow, and here he was, merely occupying a Sword Qi Great Wall. Was he really too afraid to ascend the wall for a battle?

It seemed that if a man wasn't a sword cultivator, he was simply not up to par.

After a moment of silence, Chen Qingdu suddenly asked, “Is it really that difficult to break through the bottleneck of the Jade Purity Realm?”

Wei Jin replied candidly, “For me, it is indeed very difficult. Back then, when I fortuitously encountered Senior Ah Liang, breaking through to the Nascent Soul bottleneck was already a stroke of luck. I felt guilty for taking credit for a feat that was not entirely mine.”

He had expected the Sword Immortal would mock him a bit, but to his surprise, Chen Qingdu nodded. “Reaching the Immortal realm is no easy feat. In fact, for sword cultivators, every realm has its challenges.”

Wei Jin inquired, “Senior Sword Immortal, could you offer me some guidance?”

Chen Qingdu turned to this renowned sword master of Baoping Continent and acknowledged him as a young man troubled by his emotions. As for Wei Jin, being able to ascend to the upper five realms of sword immortals by the age of forty in a world where sword luck was relatively sparse, was an impressive achievement, especially within the Sword Qi Great Wall.

How did Wei Jin manage that? Apart from his innate talent, it was largely thanks to that rascal Ah Liang, who imparted clever strategies to him. The ancient records of the Sword Qi Great Wall were like gold standards for sword cultivators in the wilderness world, but only if one could actually turn the pages. Ah Liang had no trouble with that; he had almost finished reading them all, charmingly calling it the scholar's way of stealing knowledge, which could also be seen as a form of cultured thievery.

Ah Liang assisted Wei Jin in taking risks and breaking through prematurely, allowing him to become a prominent figure in Baoping Continent's sword cultivation. Strictly speaking, his methods weren't particularly noble and didn't showcase exceptional skill. Having lived for ten thousand years, Chen Qingdu could naturally see through Wei Jin's cultivation foundation. The notion that strong practitioners relied on strong luck held some truth; as long as Wei Jin reached the upper five realms and remained on Baoping Continent, he could easily dominate the continent, sitting atop the mountains, with winds and storms at his command. He could freely seize the sword luck of Baoping Continent. With his innate talent, he could take his time over the next hundred years to steadily advance; unless something unexpected occurred, attaining the Immortal realm was inevitable.

What was remarkable about Wei Jin was his ability to know when to retreat. After a brief encounter with the Northern Julu Continent's Celestial Xie Shi, which solidified his Jade Purity cultivation, he immediately abandoned the easily obtainable path to the Dao and instead came to the Sword Qi Great Wall. If not for the sudden emergence of the new Hidden Official, Wei Jin might have perished in this foreign land, leaving Baoping Continent with nothing more than a distant, vague legend of a sword immortal.

Chen Qingdu had always appreciated such a young man.

He dared to fight for great fortunes and was willing to risk death!

In contrast, there was another little rascal who was quite reluctant to die. However, preferring to live a miserable life rather than face death was acceptable in Chen Qingdu's eyes—it was something he could relate to.

After hearing Wei Jin's earnest plea, Chen Qingdu did not rush to give an answer. He smiled and said, “Why did you only ask this today? You, Wei Jin, are quite clever; living in that little hut behind me, you should understand that this is my tacit approval. First, there was Cao Ci, then Chen Ping'an, and now you—it's not everyone who can be neighbors with Chen Qingdu.”

Wei Jin gazed towards the battlefield in the south and softly said, “As the only sword immortal from Baoping Continent, I hope to come to the Sword Qi Great Wall with a heart free of selfish desires, and ultimately leave with dignity. This is one reason. Moreover, I wish to trade my swordsmanship for insights from the Senior Sword Immortal. When Senior Ah Liang guided me, I don’t want our next reunion to leave him thinking he once aided a useless person who failed to achieve anything significant, becoming just another sword immortal who idly waits on the realm ledger, living off his past.”

There were some things Wei Jin left unspoken.

Once, when he drank with Senior Ah Liang, he had teased him, saying that those who were infatuated in this world often find it hard to be with their lovers, especially given that the threads of fate were so chaotically intertwined nowadays. One couldn't just force a girl into a wedding carriage. So, one should take a step back and strive to improve oneself. Let the girl he missed harbor a subtle regret; perhaps in the future, when she argued with her husband, she might reminisce and say, “That so-and-so was once my admirer.”

Chen Qingdu liked Wei Jin's straightforwardness and chuckled, “From now on, every now and then, when you accumulate a bit of merit in battle, I will teach you a sword technique of considerable rank, one that is foundational to the Dao of an old friend from my youth.”

Wei Jin clasped his fists in gratitude but said nothing.

To him, the heart of a sword cultivator lay in the act of drawing the sword.

Chen Qingdu shook his head. “Not very wise.”

The old man rubbed his chin, clicking his tongue. “Thanks to Senior Ah Liang, he spent a hundred years sharpening his ears. Now that he’s gone, there's another manager taking charge. It seems the transition from extravagance to frugality is truly difficult.”

Wei Jin sighed, “I can’t learn that.”

The old man laughed, “No need to learn; besides, you wouldn’t be able to.”

Wei Jin asked, “Will Senior Ah Liang return to the Sword Qi Great Wall?”

Chen Qingdu countered, “Have you ever thought about why Ah Liang taught you the methods for closing off and breaking through?”

Wei Jin replied, “I have pondered it, but I couldn’t quite grasp it.”

“Ah Liang didn’t just happen upon you; he sought you out on purpose and then taught you swordsmanship. He wasn't calculating that you would certainly come to the Sword Qi Great Wall, nor did he think you were lacking and merely gave you a handout so that you, the future master of sword luck on the continent, would feel grateful. Rather, he genuinely hopes that you, Wei Jin, can stand side by side with him in the future. This applies to you, and to all the kindred spirits who walk behind you—Ah Liang treats them the same.”

Chen Qingdu continued, “This answer encapsulates the essence of the sword technique I will teach you. Sword cultivators need to associate with the weak and seek guidance from the strong. Those who regard others as mere ants are themselves ants. Remember, back in the day, who wasn't an ant beneath their feet?”

Wei Jin seemed to grasp something.

The old man clasped his hands behind his back, glanced at the sky, then turned his gaze back to the southern land.

Sword cultivators are sword cultivators, soaring in the heavens while walking the earth.

When a sword cultivator, clearly an immortal, chooses to humbly identify as a mere sword practitioner, it carries a special meaning.

In Chen Qingdu’s view, Wei Jin was just a step short of that understanding. Although this young sword immortal had always been in the martial world, he never truly felt like he belonged; he saw himself as a transient in the mortal realm, ultimately destined to ascend the mountains as a celestial being, taking his sword along while striving to sever ties with all worldly affairs, fearing entanglements of fate.

Yet.

As Chen Qingdu gazed into the distance, he recalled a picture from his youth.

Sword cultivators ascend heights and seek guidance from the heavens; the highest among them become increasingly intertwined with the world. Gradually, step by step, they tug the entire realm upward, as if dragging the world along with them.

This was the essence of the early sword cultivators—this was true purity of sword heart.

With immense will and great aspirations, they shouldered heavy burdens and endured severe trials, determined to elevate all of humanity to greater heights.

Today’s sword cultivators and other practitioners of Qi all wish to cultivate a heart free of desires, severing ties with the mundane, hoping to become untainted celestial beings on the mountains. 

Even if the vast majority of cultivators think this way, it is still acceptable; however, if everyone were to adopt this mindset, that would be a significant problem.

Chen Qingdu clasped his hands behind his back and lightly tapped his palm, muttering to himself, “We need more of the former and fewer of the latter; both types must exist, and neither can be absent.”

---

On the southern battlefield.

That Jade Purity Realm sword immortal, a death warrior, exchanged a strike with Ning Yao, sustaining a minor injury. Yet, he showed no inclination to continue fighting, immediately employing a strange secret technique to escape. Where blood flowed on the battlefield, intricate ripples emerged, clearly the remnants of the demonic sword immortal's soul. His escape route was not a straight line; it seemed he had used some formation.

Ning Yao's second strike missed entirely. Moreover, a place sixty zhang behind her where blood had pooled began to ripple. For a sword cultivator, that distance was almost negligible, yet the sword immortal death warrior seemed intent on a desperate blow. Ning Yao, more ruthless, resolved to exchange injury for death. Even though she could have avoided it, she deliberately paused, giving the demonic sword immortal a chance.

However, the death warrior ultimately abandoned the opportunity, completely discarding any intent to assassinate and chose to retreat from the battlefield.

The golden robe Ning Yao wore was, according to the records in the Gengzi ledger, undoubtedly of immortal-grade quality, which was extremely restraining for a top-tier assassin like her who aimed for a successful strike.

Unable to locate her opponent, Ning Yao surveyed her surroundings. Noticing no sign of him on the nearby battlefield, she decided to cease her pursuit.

However, she had memorized the death warrior's escape route and silently deduced it in her heart. If she had another chance to confront him, her strikes would be more precise.

What truly vexed Ning Yao was that the Nascent Soul sword cultivator who had targeted Chen Ping'an also retreated decisively after a failed attack. The demon army acted as a natural barrier. When Ning Yao initiated her third strike, that Nascent Soul sword cultivator barely dodged it. With a hand gesture, the sword cultivator transformed into hundreds of sword lights that scattered rapidly. As Ning Yao raised her hand, the many discarded and broken weapons on the ground surged forth like flying swords, all in pursuit of the escaping sword lights.

The sky above the battlefield resembled a torrential downpour of fragmented flying swords.

Meanwhile, Ning Yao darted ten zhang away, avoiding the distant Chen Ping'an, and slashed forward.

However, the flying sword from the earlier attack on Chen Ping'an had missed. The so-called failure merely meant the sword had not killed him. Chen Ping'an was trapped in a great formation, and a sudden strike from a Nascent Soul sword cultivator left him with nowhere to hide. All he could do was avoid fatal blows; thus, the sword pierced through his shoulder, leaving a gaping wound. The sword cultivator's flying sword was not only sharp; it was the residual sword energy that posed the real threat, creating a subtle and intricate battlefield within the injured person's microcosm—a myriad of sword intents, like countless dragons crossing a river, with the sword energy flooding through his acupoints.

Injuries caused by a sword cultivator’s flying sword were notoriously difficult to heal, a universally accepted fact, and sword cultivators had earned their place as the most troublesome foes on the mountains.

On the battlefield, Fan Dache could no longer see Chen Ping'an.

The vast demon army surged from all directions, overwhelming the area, clearly intent on surrounding and killing the young man.

The first to recognize the young Hidden Official's face was a demon cultivator, who revealed his identity. Immediately, the army began to scatter, driven by a primal instinct for survival.

This was not only because the young Hidden Official had recently triumphed over Li Zhen, a disciple of the Tuo Yue Mountain, but he had also frightened Li Zhen, a top genius of the wilderness world, nearly to the point of losing his soul. This incident had already spread throughout the demon army, and the news was destined to spread slowly southward, becoming a hot topic across the vast wilderness, in towns and streets, year after year, like the grass on the plain, thriving and wilting in cycles. Even a hundred years from now, those who witnessed the events might recount the story over meals.

Moreover, the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall had become synonymous with the girl named Xiao Xian, who had braids like a sheep's horn.

Once the demon army remembered that this Hidden Official was not the same as the previous one, coupled with the fact that Chen Ping'an was alone, too deeply infiltrated into enemy lines, and Ning Yao appeared to have no intention of providing support, many demon cultivators who had lost close friends at the hands of that young warrior were resolute in their desire for revenge. They were willing to sacrifice their lives to injure the young man. Meanwhile, others, feeling that he was just one person and their army was strong, secretly unleashed spells or launched their life-bound items, confident of their success. There were also cunning Gold Core demons and sword cultivator death warriors, striking precisely and viciously, not hoping for a lethal blow but merely seeking to inflict pain.

On the battlefield, the chaos was infectious; individuals often followed the tide, whether to flee, transform, bravely fight to the death, or generously face death.

And then, with the injury inflicted by that Nascent Soul sword cultivator onto the young Hidden Official, the atmosphere was thick with murderous intent, overwhelming all around.

In the distance, Fan Dache murmured, “This formation shouldn’t have been opened so widely; it’s too perilous. In such a battlefield, isn’t danger everywhere? This is no mere contest of strength.”

If not for Ning Yao holding the line, the second manager’s reckless strike would have surely led to death.

Ning Yao said, “It’s precisely because I’m here that he would dare to strike like this. That’s the order of things; it must be understood this way.”

Ning Yao also knew why Fan Dache was so anxious—ultimately, he was worried about Chen Ping'an’s safety.

Ning Yao didn’t elaborate; after all, Fan Dache was not a pure warrior. The path of sword cultivation and the gradual ascension of pure warriors, while they may seem to converge, were fundamentally different.

This was true martial combat—fighting with strength and courage—merely a small path of martial arts. To contend against heaven and earth with one's own power and fists, that was the true grandeur of the Dao.

In the distance, the center of the encirclement had almost transformed into a slowly moving hill.

As Fan Dache was sheathing his sword, he couldn't help but ask, “Is everything really okay like this?”

“Something is wrong on their end,” Ning Yao replied.

Fan Dache fell silent.

He could only continue striking from the edge of the battlefield, doing his best to relieve some of Chen Ping'an's pressure.

In truth, it didn’t hold much significance, but one had to do something.

In dealing with others, when one lacks the ability, seeking peace of mind is a good habit to cultivate.

Ning Yao wielded her sword, weaving through the battlefield. A golden line wove through the demon army, its brilliance lingering. There were both straight paths and crooked golden trails, extending thousands of zhang. Wherever she passed, remnants of limbs and corpses were severed by the golden long sword, which itself formed a natural array, laden with potent sword intent. The surrounding sword energy overflowed, causing the demon army great distress; many five-realm cultivators simply lay down to avoid the increasingly dense golden lines.

Many Dragon Gate and Gold Core demon cultivators quickly fled from the suspended golden sword formation.

Once Ning Yao gathered enough sword energy, she pinched a technique with her fingers and lightly swiped downward.

It was as if a storm had paused in mid-air, like an enormous pond just above the ground, before abruptly crashing to the earth.

On Chen Ping'an's battlefield, the ground shook, and the force of his punch roared like thunder.

Nearby demons splattered away as the small hill formed by the demon army seemed to shatter from within.

Fan Dache let out a sigh of relief, finally catching a glimpse of Chen Ping'an, who appeared somewhat disheveled, his clothes torn and bloodied, yet his overwhelming fist intent was almost visible, enveloping him as if protected by a divine presence.

Perhaps this was the most genuine embodiment of a martial artist's golden body.

Although Fan Dache was a sword cultivator who dreamed of becoming a sword immortal, witnessing this scene forced him to acknowledge the sheer ferocity of a martial artist entrenched in battle, unyielding even in the face of death.

After being struck by a brilliant spell on his back, Chen Ping'an staggered only a step before propelling himself forward, charging ten zhang ahead to clear a path with his fists.

He was struck midsection by a powerful demon cultivator with a heavy weapon, sending Chen Ping'an flying dozens of zhang, along with a barrage of spells and numerous life-bound weapons attacking him from all directions.

In the blink of an eye, as soon as Chen Ping'an landed, a small hill formed again on the battlefield, and he vanished from sight.

Fan Dache felt increasingly alarmed. Were the demon cultivators going mad? Were they truly so willing to risk their lives?!

Ning Yao continued to leave the frontline to the injured Chen Ping'an. At most, she would help with a few strikes, thinning out the demon army's ranks on either side with the sword immortal, cutting down some of their lateral strength.

As a piece of immortal-grade equipment, the sword immortal had developed a certain connection with Chen Ping'an, akin to a child beginning to speak. It was evident that it was now quite exhilarated. 

In the past, under Chen Ping'an's command, it had indeed felt stifled, being called upon at will by a master who wasn't even a true sword cultivator. What was crucial was that in every fierce battle, the sword immortal had never felt fully satisfied.

Ning Yao remained calm and composed, her sword heart steady, executing her strikes with precision; yet, that didn’t mean she felt no concern for Chen Ping'an’s predicament.

In the battlefield, what merit would there be for the Hidden Official of the Sword Qi Great Wall if he were to perish?

Among the sixty military tents of the wilderness world, there was considerable debate over this matter, with opinions roughly divided into three camps.

One faction, led by the Gengyin tent, believed that killing the Hidden Official Chen Ping'an should be regarded as equivalent to slaying a Jade Purity Realm sword immortal. Their reasoning was that, although Chen Ping'an held a high position and great power as the new Hidden Official at the Sword Qi Great Wall, commanding troops and strategies that inflicted great losses on the wilderness world, he was not a sword cultivator and, in terms of realm, was not particularly high. Although he had managed to defeat Li Zhen in a direct confrontation, he did not necessarily possess the combat power of a peak Nascent Soul sword cultivator. Therefore, adding the title of Hidden Official and considering him as a Jade Purity Realm sword immortal was quite reasonable.

Another major faction, led by the Dingmao tent, supported by the endorsements of two prominent demon lords, Yang Zhi and Huang Luan, contended that this young Hidden Official posed a significant threat, both in terms of real power and the symbolic significance to the Sword Qi Great Wall. Thus, killing Chen Ping'an should be considered equivalent to defeating an immortal realm sword cultivator, worthy of being regarded as a great sword immortal.

Beyond this, there was a solitary Jia Shen tent that proposed an even more shocking view: as long as one could kill Chen Ping'an, the merit should at least be regarded as between that of killing Dong Sangeng, Chen Xi, Qi Tingji, and Lu Zhi, or Lao Long'er and Nalan Shaowei. Even if the merit were to be equivalent to that of a sword cultivator from the Ascension realm, it would not be unreasonable!

The debate raged on. The Gengzi tent compiled opinions and ultimately decided that the merit for killing Chen Ping'an would be assessed as that of slaying a great sword immortal, but it should rank between Nalan Shaowei and Yue Qing, not to be simply seen as an ordinary great sword immortal.

Fan Dache's heart trembled.

On the distant battlefield, the first time Chen Ping'an was struck by a demon cultivator, he was sent crashing towards Fan Dache's direction with a double-fisted blow.

In mid-air, Chen Ping'an twisted his body, evading several crucial spells and magical artifacts. He braved the remaining attacks and landed gracefully, sliding back five or six steps. With a heavy stomp, he regained his balance, returning to the battlefield at an even faster pace, directly confronting a demon cultivator who was also a pure martial artist. This opponent was not only the leader of a demon army but also a cultivator, and after transforming into human form, he was tall and robust, armed with no weapons.

On the line, the two pure martial artists clashed head-on, their fists colliding, sending shockwaves that pushed back the surrounding demon army.

The distant traveling demon cultivator and Chen Ping'an each took a punch without retreating, instead exchanging blows anew. The impact resounded like muffled drums on the battlefield.

The traveling demon cultivator roared, signaling the nearby Gold Core and Dragon Gate cultivators to disregard their own lives and unleash all their magical artifacts and spells.

In the blink of an eye, Chen Ping'an switched his stance, delivering sixteen consecutive punches.

Since the opponent dared to stand still, he would not take a step back either. Regardless of their identities or factions, in martial combat, nothing was more exhilarating than trading blows without moving.

Direct and straightforward, as long as the martial art was superior and the punches heavy enough, the opponent would fall obediently, like acknowledging the superiority of one’s power in the art of fists!

Among the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage, Deng Liang was the most stable in temperament. Originally a wild cultivator who had later been accepted into the sect as a record-keeper and immortal teacher, he understood the taste of the muddy world and had been influenced by the ethereal aura of the mountain's cave abodes. Thus, he was naturally not prone to impatience.

Almost everyone’s calmness is honed gradually.

However, today, for some reason, Deng Liang suddenly overturned the writing desk.

Instantly, he became quiet, muttering an apology, and after a moment of sitting in a daze, he got up to tidy his desk.

Sword Immortal Chou Miao gently shook his head, signaling everyone not to speak.

With Chou Miao's stance, the other sword cultivators could only follow suit and ignore him. Even those like Xuan Can and Cao Gun, who were also outsiders like Deng Liang, remained silent.

Dong Budu shot a glare at Guo Zhujiu, who was making exaggerated gestures towards him.

What did it matter? Just because Deng Liang liked her didn't mean she should feel the same.

Deng Liang's expression was gloomy as he took out a wine jug and drank silently.

During the earlier process of seeking sword guidance at the Sword Qi Great Wall from the wilderness world, three young geniuses had discarded their life-bound flying swords.

Among the three sword cultivators considered outstanding even within the Sword Qi Great Wall, their paths were cut off without any doubt, and there were no further chances.

Subsequently, during this chaotic battle, four had been ambushed and killed by the sword immortal death warriors. As for the young sword cultivators not recorded in the ledger, there were even more.

This was still in the context of the Sword Qi Great Wall having two stationed sword immortals and over forty earth immortals temporarily descending from the city to support and lay ambush.

The spiritual energy of the Sword Qi Great Wall was rapidly dwindling.

The daily consumption of resources was an astronomical sum that no sect in the wilderness world could fathom. Once calculated into immortal money, even the cultivators responsible for managing finances would feel their hearts waver upon merely glancing at the figures in the ledger.

As the world shifted, it was being subtly accelerated by the wilderness world.

According to the hidden secrets revealed by that Hidden Official, every previous strike by the three sect saints had not been easy. After jointly crafting that golden river that cleaved the battlefield, it was more like a resolute choice, one with no turning back. Or perhaps they had originally had a path but chose not to take it.

The situation loomed like a tide; regardless of how hard the Hidden Official lineage struggled or how the sword cultivators on the city wall forgot about life and death, exerting their utmost to slay enemies, it seemed that delaying the momentum for even a moment would ultimately be futile.

Deng Liang, a wild cultivator, could accept failure, but he had never felt so stifled, humiliated, and indignant, eventually succumbing to a sense of despair, relying on wine to drown his sorrows.

The more he remained in the summer palace and accessed firsthand information, observing the overall situation, the clearer he saw the ebb and flow of the battles and the losses on both sides. The more profound his comprehension of the war’s trajectory became, the more helpless he felt.

Lin Junbi was busy with her tasks.

Chou Miao glanced at Lin Junbi, and the young sword immortal subtly nodded. Lin Junbi, a prodigy from the Central Land, had lofty aspirations.

Lin Junbi was unaware of how highly she was regarded in Chou Miao’s eyes.

After arriving at the Sword Qi Great Wall, the first lesson Lin Junbi learned was to lower her stance as much as possible.

In fact, while she radiated intelligence, wit, and spirit, making her exceptionally outstanding, she still didn’t seem as trustworthy as Chou Miao, who was more grounded and reserved.

The young sword immortal, laden with a plethora of legendary tales, had become a sword cultivator of the Hidden Official lineage, yet she was not the new Hidden Official herself. She was slightly lesser in stature, having never uttered any words that would cause people to gasp in awe or committed any acts that would leave others astonished.

Yet, she was able to command respect and inspire trust.

Everyone in the Hidden Official lineage likely contemplated who would become the next Hidden Official if anything were to happen to the young one. It would surely be Chou Miao, not Lin Junbi.

Lin Junbi bore no resentment over this. Recognizing her own inadequacies, she accepted it. She was never afraid to deal with masters; she learned quickly, and as long as it wasn’t a life-and-death situation, any sparring would only enrich her own skills.

Lin Junbi knew very well that Chou Miao’s ability to gain the crowd’s favor was not solely due to her high cultivation realm.

There were many aspects of Chou Miao worth emulating and learning from.

For instance, no one would think of Chou Miao as the kind of extraordinary and cunningly intelligent person.

Everyone’s first impression would certainly not be that way.

If Chou Miao is skilled in swordsmanship but gentle in temperament, without sharp edges, then the impression left by the young Hidden Official was that she was not particularly high in realm but could fight well. She had deep internal schemes yet was genuinely kind-hearted.

Moreover, with the diverse strengths of the sword cultivators in the Hidden Official lineage, Lin Junbi benefited greatly from her experiences there. So why would she leave?

Even if Chen Ping'an urged her to go, Lin Junbi might not choose to leave.

Lin Junbi glanced at the temporarily unoccupied main seat and gently shook her head. She would not leave, but she absolutely would not take on the role of the Hidden Official.

Chen Sanqiu observed the situation near the battlefield, took a moment to consider, then called for Dong Hua Fu to join him as they flew closer to Chen Ping'an. He also instructed Dong Pangzi and Diezhong to muster some strength; once they caught their breath, they would immediately return to support.

The two changed battlefields, forming a triangular formation with Chen Ping'an and Ning Yao.

Dong Hua Fu squatted atop the long sword and began to draw conclusions. “Compared to Sister Ning's opening formations, this is a bit slower.”

Dong Hua Fu thought for a moment and recalled the second manager's life-bound divine ability, which was accounting, and added, “But Ah Liang once said, men shouldn’t be too quick.”

Chen Sanqiu burst into laughter.

Unexpectedly, just then, the second manager was struck by a demon cultivator clad in golden crow armor, a punch that seemed to break through the formation, piercing through the army's arrangement that Chen Sanqiu had just thinned out. The demon cultivator fell not far from Chen Sanqiu, and after rolling over, stood up, shattering a life-bound artifact that clung to him like a parasite. With a sudden intake of pure qi, he stabilized his stance, but the wounds on his body burst open, blood flowing.

The clothing borrowed from the sword cultivators of the Hidden Official lineage had nearly all been expended. He wore the last remaining one, which was already in tatters, leaving his upper body almost exposed, with injuries revealing white bones. Chen Ping'an donned the last piece of the Ning family's green shirt robe and turned to look at Dong Heitan.

Chen Ping'an smiled.

Ning Yao smiled from a distance too.

Dong Hua Fu responded with a silly grin.

Chen Ping'an leaned back, narrowly dodging a severe sword light that attacked from behind. Before falling to the ground, he slapped the earth, flipped his body, took a step forward, and finally used the shrinking ground talisman for the first time, reaching the side of a sneaky demon sword cultivator who had attacked multiple times. With a sweeping arm, he severed the demon's head, then bent down to use the lifeless body as a shield, crashing sideways.

A demon cultivator with a dull expression, resembling a middle-aged man, picked up a broken sword from the ground—its quality was poor, barely resembling a sword at all. He stepped forward and struck down, lacking brilliant sword light or sharp intent, yet silent like the sword holder himself. Chen Ping'an did not even have time to activate the square inch talisman; his fist intent reached its peak, and he struggled to grasp the sword's edge, but still, he was struck down into the ground.

The man did not intend to use brute force to sever both of Chen Ping'an's hands and shoulders. Instead, he casually drew out the ordinary long sword and slashed towards Chen Ping'an's neck.

Chen Ping'an directly raised his left hand to block his heart, and the man was clearly slightly surprised. His sword would indeed change trajectory midway, shattering Chen Ping'an's heart. At the critical moment of changing his sword, the man took a step forward, his form becoming ethereal like a flying sword, appearing directly behind Chen Ping'an. The sword tip twisted casually, stabbing back, hitting Chen Ping'an's spine. Almost simultaneously, Chen Ping'an gathered his fists into a dragon form, the sword tip momentarily stalling before propelling him forward faster. Sure enough, the “second” sword-wielding man appeared right in front of Chen Ping'an, bringing down his sword straight down.

The man smiled slightly, increased his strength, and gripped the long sword tightly.

On the battlefield, nearly a hundred sword cultivators quickly surrounded Chen Ping'an in a circle, all holding swords, none wielding life-bound flying swords, with various stances aimed directly at Chen Ping'an.

Moreover, in six other locations outside the circular sword formation, there were men holding swords, seemingly waiting for Chen Ping'an to use the square inch talisman.

In addition, in front of Ning Yao, Fan Dache, Chen Sanqiu, and Dong Hua Fu, another vast circular sword formation, filled with sword-wielding individuals, emerged.

One person pointed his sword at Chen Ping'an, Ning Yao, Chen Sanqiu, and Dong Hua Fu, two young geniuses noted in the Gengzi ledger, plus another Gold Core sword cultivator not listed.

This man was truly targeting both Chen Ping'an and Fan Dache.

As for the outcome, he had already handed the choice to all the sword cultivators of the same age in the Sword Qi Great Wall; he didn’t care much for the result.

When a sword cultivator draws their sword, it is most important that they are true to themselves. The merits of the battle are secondary.

Each sword-wielding individual was real or fake, sharing the burden of combat power, requiring precise calculations.

The sword-wielding man seemed somewhat helpless, and his already elusive form burst apart.

The remaining sword-wielding individuals were targeted by at least two to three, up to five or six flying swords.

And that young Hidden Official remained immobile.

At the same time, the man who concealed his face and aura, who had vanished and reappeared, glanced at Chen Ping'an, sharing a knowing smile, and in the elegant language of the righteous realm, uttered, “Kindred spirits.”

This strange sword cultivator, who had appeared mysteriously and vanished like a ghost, was no longer around.

Chen Ping'an sheathed all his flying swords, returning to a single “Moon at the Bottom of the Well.” The essence of this flying sword's life-bound divine ability was the moon reflecting in a deep well; as long as ripples stirred in the heart lake, every draw and sheath of the sword would represent a cycle of the moon, shattering and then reforming, all depending on the thoughts of the sword cultivator.

Finally managing to nurture two life-bound flying swords, he found himself having to reveal the Moon at the Bottom of the Well ahead of time.

Chen Ping'an inwardly cursed the damned kindred spirits.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 765: Where is the Hometown of Sword Cultivators?

Ning Yao allowed Chen Ping'an to return to the city first, reminding him to be careful on the way back.

Dong Hua Fu felt that this statement was a bit unnecessary.

Speaking plainly had always been Dong Hua Fu's style.

Chen Sanqiu chuckled, "Between men and women, if there aren't a few unnecessary words, it would be troublesome."

Dong Hua Fu nodded in agreement and then asked, "Do you have any chance to say those unnecessary words?"

Chen Sanqiu responded with a smile reminiscent of the shopkeeper's.

Dong Hua Fu, fearing that the shopkeeper might hold a grudge, wasn't particularly worried about Chen Sanqiu—who dreamed of becoming her brother-in-law—so she added some fuel to the fire with her words. "The reason my sister became a sword cultivator under the Hidden Official lineage isn’t because she’s deliberately avoiding you, right? If that's the case, then fine, I'll help you out later. This is the least I can do for a friend."

Chen Sanqiu shook his head. "That's not the case. Your sister is straightforward; she likes what she likes and doesn't like what she doesn't. She wouldn't be so deliberate about it."

When you like someone, everything about them seems wonderful.

Moreover, from the time Chen Sanqiu was a child, wearing short pants, he felt that the neighbor's older sister, Dong Bu De, was genuinely good, not just because she caught his eye.

It was like when he first saw the words "childhood sweethearts" in a book; he thought that was the most touching term in the world, far surpassing any tranquil lakes or fiery autumn mountains.

If one were to say Dong Bu De was extraordinarily beautiful, that wouldn't quite be the case.

It was just that over the years, the more Chen Sanqiu drank, the fonder he became of her.

Before Chen Ping'an arrived at the Sword Qi Great Wall, during the previous skirmishes, as long as Chen Sanqiu finished his sword practice early, he would go watch Dong Bu De from afar. Once, during a particularly tense situation, he lent her a hand. Afterward, Dong Bu De thanked him and followed up with a blunt remark that pierced his heart. It was the second time she had made it clear that they were both sword cultivators and acquaintances. While it was fine to help each other on the battlefield, she advised him not to entertain any thoughts of becoming that mountain companion of hers; just thinking about it made her skin crawl. After that encounter, Chen Sanqiu returned to the city and, having drunk some wine, found himself pushing against walls and crashing into trees again.

Chen Ping'an was injured quite severely; it wasn't just superficial wounds but also serious internal injuries left by the flying swords of other cultivators and the attacks from various demonic practitioners on his life source. Despite this, his spirit seemed to be rising rather than diminishing. Ning Yao hadn't seen such a bright-eyed Chen Ping'an in a long time.

At that moment, his entire being was a chaotic mess of energy, which wasn't entirely a bad thing. As Li Er had once said, his junior brother Zheng Dafeng had some insights after visiting that Crab Workshop sign, and upon returning, he mentioned that a person's body was like an ancient battlefield site, so there was no need to seek outside for help—this wasn't just empty talk about cultivating the mind.

So right now, Chen Ping'an was essentially a martial training ground himself. He excelled at unraveling the threads of his own condition and using pure true energy to overpower the spiritual energy of other cultivators.

He picked up a damaged long sword of unknown origin. The sword itself wasn't particularly mystical; it was just extremely heavy, indicating the forging material must be of decent quality—worth a considerable amount of celestial currency. 

In the martial world of the minor states on Treasure Bottle Continent, this would be a genuine divine weapon, one that even the local water gods might fear.

Chen Ping'an took the lead, riding his sword northward, selecting a weaker point in the demonic army’s formation and occasionally throwing a punch along the way.

Instead of heading directly to the city wall, he flew upwards to the highest "horizontal bar" of the wall, sitting cross-legged. He took out his sword nurturing gourd and drank a few mouthfuls of osmanthus wine, watching the battlefield unfold closely. As he calmed his breath, he skillfully bandaged his wounds.

Every large character carved into the wall, especially the horizontal strokes, was an excellent place for cultivation.

However, when it came to the stage of the ant-like siege warfare, these natural sword cultivation grounds often turned into places of certain death.

Thus, those old sword cultivators who could practice here for hundreds of years must possess tremendous killing power and exceptional survival skills.

Not far from Chen Ping'an sat an elderly sword cultivator with his eyes closed, nurturing his spirit. The old man did not rise to greet him, so Chen Ping'an remained silent, not wanting to disturb the elder’s quiet meditation.

The elder appeared to be Yin Chen, a sixth-page infant sword cultivator from the third volume. Though he was advanced in years, he had been stuck at the infant realm, unable to break through. His temper was fierce, and he was a solitary figure, without close friends. Most sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall had close friendships, whether living or dead, but Yin Chen had none. Whenever he entered battle, he was full of killing intent, and once he drew his sword, he would not distinguish between friend and foe, resulting in a large number of kills among both demons and fellow sword cultivators alike. His accumulated military achievements were minimal, even less than many younger golden core sword cultivators, as much of his merit was erased. Consequently, Yin Chen's reputation was poor; few were willing to approach a monster who might even kill his own kind.

Each native sword cultivator noted in the first and third volumes had different annotations from the Hidden Official lineage. If the interpretations from the Summer Palace sword cultivators were too numerous, they would be mixed with a few extra sheets.

Regarding the highly ranked Yin Chen, there were surprisingly few insights recorded, with only a few notes from Chou Miao and Lin Junbi, which were entirely different from the general views of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

If battlefield friendly fire was common, almost every sword immortal would have experienced it. However, it could hardly be said that they bore the blame. Yin Chen was different; many times, the old man's sharp sword strikes were calculated to guarantee the deaths of a few sword cultivators.

According to the responsibilities of the Hidden Official lineage, the elder sword cultivator Yin Chen should merely guard his position and not engage in battle.

After bandaging his various wounds, Chen Ping'an summoned a purification talisman, swiftly erasing the bloodstains. After all, he was a guest; even if the host wasn't particularly welcoming, there was no reason for a guest not to show basic courtesy.

The elder opened his eyes, his voice hoarse as he spoke, "You're quite the amusing lad. I've seen a few pure martial artists at the Sword Qi Great Wall. Others throw punches, constrained by flying swords and magical treasures, but here you are, holding yourself back."

Chen Ping'an turned his head and smiled, "Elder Yin, you have a keen eye."

The elder asked, "You didn't feel any discomfort for not calling me 'Lord Hidden Official'?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Not at all."

Yin Chen gazed toward the battlefield front. To the north of the golden river was Ning Yao lending assistance, while southward were the sword cultivators tasked with forming the array. Yin Chen sneered, "Every time I see these so-called young talents, I can't help but feel a bit disheartened. It's impossible to compare."

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "More sword cultivators will feel the same way when they see you, Elder Yin."

In fact, Yin Chen had once been one of those young talents, and he was exceptionally outstanding. Back in the day, his glory at the Sword Qi Great Wall was roughly equivalent to the current Gao Ye Hou and Situ Weiran.

The practice of swordsmanship had gone smoothly for him, breaking through realms like cutting through bamboo, until he reached the infant realm, where he unexpectedly stagnated, wasting hundreds of years.

Yin Chen coldly laughed, "What can a useless person do besides looking up at others and drooling? For example, me—sitting here all year round, I've gone from a young useless one to an old useless one."

One who can be harsh even on themselves is practically unbeatable when it comes to arguing.

Chen Ping'an asked, "Did you see the sword-wielding man earlier, Elder Yin? Did you discern his roots?"

Yin Chen scoffed, "The Hidden Official lineage gets weaker with each generation. You, an outsider, have already reached a decent realm, yet relying on some superficial connections, you managed to claim Elder Xiao Xun's summer palace, overflowing with records and secrets, yet you don't even know this bit of information? Can't you at least make an educated guess?"

Chen Ping'an didn't mind the elder's harsh words. You can scold all you want, I'll just keep probing. He continued, "Is he the proud son of the Hundred Swords of Tuo Yue Mountain? Ranked about the same as Zhuo Qiao and Li Zhen?"

Yin Chen retorted, "I reckon the whole Sword Qi Great Wall has heard all sorts of nasty things about Elder Xiao Xun, right? Just a bunch of brats without fathers to teach them. If I were Elder Xiao Xun and I broke through the Sword Qi Great Wall, I'd hunt down every sword cultivator who insulted me—those who dared to curse me to my face would live, and those who didn't would die. That's how it should be. By the way, earlier, when the great demon Yang Zhi was slaughtering that southern traveling sword cultivator, you, for the sake of the greater good, must have taken quite a bit of flak, huh? How was that experience? If it happened again, would you allow those reckless sword cultivators to die?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Ah Liang once told me, if a person can avoid death, they should do so at all costs. If taking a few insults can save many lives, is there a more worthwhile deal than that? I think very few."

Yin Chen immediately fell silent.

It wasn't that the young man's logic was particularly sound; that wasn't the issue at all.

This young Hidden Official was a disciple of the scholarly lineage known for its seclusion, a junior brother of sorts, even having a good relationship with the elder sword immortal. However, the moment he got involved with that Ah Liang, Yin Chen felt a headache coming on.

For over a century, Yin Chen had been thoroughly exploited by that despicable fellow. It was like catching a fat sheep and mercilessly plucking its wool. Once the wool was gone, the sheep had grown thin, but now that the fat sheep was recovering its vigor, it was time to pluck it again. If Ah Liang only had those methods, Yin Chen could ignore him. However, that fellow could genuinely sit beside him, chattering away for hours just to say, "As long as I can have a word with Elder Yin, this trip to the Sword Qi Great Wall will be worth it." At that time, Yin Chen couldn't help but curse him to get lost, only for the other party to retaliate and pin him down for a good beating.

When Ah Liang left, he was in high spirits, striking a signature pose, running his hands through his hair, and leaving behind the words, "What a thrill! I’ve had over eight hundred battles, and still undefeated!"

Yin Chen had laid on the ground for half a day, bewildered.

After that, Ah Liang often came to find the old sword immortal, claiming to chat and bond, while sneakily boosting his win count.

Recall that Ah Liang, Yin Chen wasn't entirely resentful; after all, neither of them had ever really practiced swordsmanship together. Most of their interactions revolved around Ah Liang boasting about how popular he was with good girls in the world of Haoran. Yet, throughout it all, he never managed to mention a single girl’s name. However, the occasional serious words from Ah Liang often targeted Yin Chen’s bottleneck in the infant realm.

Regardless of how bad his temper was, Yin Chen still felt he had to acknowledge that kindness.

He might not be good at socializing, but he could still tell the difference between good and bad people.

Sometimes, perhaps because he was too discerning, he simply felt too lazy to socialize.

They didn’t know each other well, and with their vastly different personalities, there wasn’t much to discuss. Besides, Yin Chen didn't like drinking; otherwise, Chen Ping'an would have offered him a jar of bamboo sea cave wine.

Suddenly, Yin Chen said, "Is this how pure martial artists of the Haoran world practice their punches?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "The routes to practicing punches are actually quite similar; it all starts with getting hit first—just the intensity varies."

Yin Chen asked again, "In front of Ning Yao, you picked up so much trash, and you still have the audacity?"

Now that was a topic worth discussing.

Chen Ping'an smiled, "I have a habit of being a bit careless, but fortunately, Ning Yao doesn't mind."

Yin Chen queried, "You don't look particularly impressive; how did you win her over? I only heard that Ning Yao traveled through the Haoran world and didn't expect her to fall victim here. If I’m being honest, you’re nowhere near Cao Ci; I specifically went to peek at him on the city wall. His looks and punches are both noteworthy; you simply can't compare."

Now this was getting interesting; the old senior was complimenting someone.

Chen Ping'an promptly got closer to the elder, took a sip of wine, and chuckled, "While I admit my punches can't compare, I think our looks aren't too far apart."

To his surprise, Yin Chen suddenly turned hostile, "I’m nurturing my sword now; could you please step aside, Hidden Official? You're quite bothersome here."

Chen Ping'an, feeling somewhat dejected, rose and flew away on his sword.

Yin Chen rested his fists on his knees, chuckling. The scholars of the Haoran world were all infuriatingly arrogant.

Chen Ping'an made his way to the straw hut on the city wall, first greeting Wei Dajian, who supported half of the tavern's business, with a smile.

Wei Jin smiled, "What a splendid punch! It certainly looks impressive! You have the style of an invincible god of punches, but it was a bit slow on the attack."

He had literally pummeled a far-traveling martial artist from the Wild World to death with his bare hands. This achievement, compared to a sword immortal’s strike, was naturally minor, but it was still rare.

It would make for a delectable accompaniment to wine.

Chen Ping'an chuckled, "Next time I visit the tavern, I’ll treat you to a bowl of plain noodles to sober you up so you won’t talk nonsense."

Wei Jin pointed back at the hut, "The elder sword immortal isn't in a good mood. If you know how to speak, then be a bit more talkative."

After parting ways with Wei Jin, as soon as Chen Ping'an landed on the city wall, the elder sword immortal stepped out of the hut, hands clasped behind him. "Oh, the Divine Warrior Chen has arrived—my humble abode is now graced."

Chen Ping'an found it strange; the elder sword immortal hadn’t been this “polite” before. His impression of the elder was that he was dignified and sparing with words.

Chen Qingdu glanced at Chen Ping'an, noting he was injured but had reaped significant gains. He communicated through thought, "I owe you two secrets. I can tell you now."

Chen Ping'an composed himself.

What followed were two so-called secrets, each more astonishing than the last.

One was about the hometown of all the imprisoned sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall.

The earliest batch of ancient prisoners had origins split evenly between the Wild World and the now-established Fifth Realm.

Chen Ping'an was taken aback.

This meant that half of the prisoners and their descendants had, from the very beginning, been in their hometown.

Thus, having been born and dying at the Sword Qi Great Wall, it was all in their hometown?

As for the remaining half of the prisoners’ descendants, if they wished to return home, it would be related to the Fifth Realm. As long as they could survive, there was at least a chance to return home?

The second secret was even greater.

The elder sword immortal's explanation was shocking: the path to becoming a pure martial artist was actually a path to becoming a deity, which would also involve military cultivators.

Though Chen Ping'an had speculated on this before, hearing it from the elder sword immortal clarified many connections. For instance, he was no longer puzzled as to why there was a Golden Body realm in martial arts. In the world, all mountain and water gods sought to manifest a Golden Body as the foundation of the Dao. 

Not to mention those ghostly spirits achieving divinity, just the experience of living humans becoming deities, similar to the experience of Yang Hua, the water god of Iron Symbol River, "the form dissolves but the bones remain," was a necessary path. This was actually quite similar to martial artists refining their bodies and honing their bones.

Chen Qingdu didn’t lay everything out, knowing that this young man liked to think. There would be plenty of time to ponder over the earlier pages of this old history.

As they walked slowly, since they had already started strolling, they couldn’t turn back too soon. The elder spoke a bit more, "Since ancient times, there has been a distinction between gods and immortals. Why the order of gods before immortals? According to current definitions, if a person's soul does not dissipate after death, they are considered a god. Enjoying the incense and sacrifices of the human realm, they need no cultivation to stabilize their Golden Body."

"To not die as an immortal is akin to those cultivators who lie on the mountains now. Historians always trim and cut their histories, and over time, the truth becomes more and more distant. If you ever get the chance, you might want to visit the three great academies. Being that old scholar’s closed-door disciple means you’ll only be flipping through a few worthless old books, but it should still hold some weight."

Chen Ping'an merely listened and remembered, finding little immediate significance in these words. If he were to be more practical, they might even seem meaningless.

However, what came next was something that made Chen Ping'an perk up, fearful of missing a single word.

"First travel far and then reach the mountain peak, followed by the tenth realm of martial arts, which is further divided into three layers: Qi Flourishing, Returning to Truth, and Reaching the Divine. What does 'Reaching the Divine' mean? I remember there's a saying in your hometown, what was it?"

"Reaching the Door!" 

Chen Ping'an blurted out, "If a person’s skill is good enough, whether they're a farmer or a porcelain maker, they are often praised as having 'reached the door.'"

Chen Qingdu nodded, "Reaching the door—what door is that? How does one walk that path? Who will guard the door? The answers are all in your hometown… what was it again?"

Chen Ping'an replied, "Yuzhe."

Chen Qingdu smiled and nodded, elaborating further on the three layers of the tenth realm.

Yet the elder's expression occasionally showed a hint of nostalgia.

In the Treasure Bottle Continent, there was an old friend who had been trapped in that "Ten Thousand Year Light Yin" for a long time.

Thus, Chen Qingdu remarked, "Cui Zhan from Xiuhuo is indeed formidable."

Chen Ping'an responded, "During the first Heart-Questioning Match, we passed through safely because Mr. Qi was present. When he wasn't there for the second match, I couldn’t hold out no matter what. That was still because Cui Zhan didn’t exert full effort."

Chen Qingdu said, "All the hardships that are hard to endure and yet survived are like a pit dug in one’s heart. The larger the pit, the more it can bear in the future."

Chen Ping'an nodded.

But it was also possible to spend a lifetime filling that pit. For instance, the more the world owes someone in their childhood, the more that person will strive to make up for it as they grow older.

Leaving the city wall, Chen Ping'an flew his sword towards the private residence of the summer palace, beginning to rest and heal.

Just two days later, Chen Ping'an made a trip to the summer palace, coming and going freely, holding a jade token without needing to consume a single Spatial Shrink Talisman.

He chose a secluded spot to observe Bai Mama teaching the children how to punch, explaining what it means for "the whole body to be a punch," what the intention is, how to learn, and how to practice.

Among the children was one he recognized—a little girl named Yuan Zao Hua, to whom he had given two folding fans. She was the only child capable of genuinely tricking the shopkeeper’s celestial money with her skills.

The other children were not strangers to Chen Ping'an either, as they had all been carefully selected as martial seeds by him and the Hidden Official lineage. One of the children had already been taken to the Central Divine Continent by Yu Jianfu, while the others who were still learning punches were all here.

There were many sword cultivators at the Sword Qi Great Wall, but pure martial artists were few and far between.

If the Sword Qi Great Wall were to fall, becoming part of the Wild World, would all those martial fates be left for the Wild World?

Of course not.

Yet, Chen Ping'an understood that temporarily clinging to hope, pushing these children to compete for the title of "strongest" was a slim chance. Moreover, the Sword Qi Great Wall inherently had a significant advantage; the Dao clashed fiercely, which he hadn't understood before but began to after being pointed out by the elder sword immortal on the city wall. The female martial god Pei Bei from the Central Divine Continent was likely well-prepared, while Cao Ci, training purely, had never sought the martial fate. In this regard, Chen Ping'an felt he couldn't compare to Cao Ci at all. Now, as long as the martial fate was willing to come, he wished he could welcome it all at once, calling it "relatives" and "family," welcoming them with open arms.

However, even if these children rushed to practice punches without earning martial fate, it wouldn’t matter much. As long as they had a skill, laid a solid foundation, they would have greater chances of survival no matter where they ended up. In a chaotic world, wanting to secure a foothold often had little to do with status.

At the training ground, Bai Mama threw a punch. The distance was short, just half an arm's length, but the intention behind the punch was heavy and natural.

At the level of a seventh realm martial artist, the so-called moves had already become a competition of the depth of punch intent, akin to a manifestation of a simple Dao.

With no warning, Bai Mama struck toward a stout boy standing nearby, who remained motionless, wearing an expression that seemed to say, "Go ahead, if you can."

This was Jiang Yun, hailing from a well-off family, distinguished by his exceptional aptitude.

After Bai Mama withdrew her punch, the boy, oblivious, was already drenched in sweat.

This was a rare potential talent.

Bai Mama threw another punch, almost touching the forehead of a girl from Yu Hu Street. Although she was slightly less capable than Jiang Yun, she didn’t move, but her figure swayed slightly.

Ten or so children stood in a line, and Bai Mama walked past each one. Some kids stepped back; others gritted their teeth and stood firm.

Yet Bai Mama hadn’t thrown a single punch.

But Chen Ping'an could tell that when Bai Mama approached several children, the intent of her punch had already reached them. Unfortunately, only one child named Xu Gong from Mu Meng Alley had the right instinct. As Bai Mama’s intent stirred, he had already stepped back early, distinctly opposite Jiang Yun, but both had the potential to develop their punch intent sooner.

Looking at Yuan Zao Hua, she appeared tense, but still didn’t notice Bai Mama’s quietly radiating punch intent.

Chen Ping'an felt that none of this was particularly concerning. The path of martial arts did emphasize aptitude and foundations, but it wasn’t as harsh as that of Qi practitioners, nor was it as reliant on luck as sword cultivators. You couldn't become a sword cultivator by just enduring hardship, but practicing punches, with a certain level of talent, could allow one to progress steadily, slowly seeing results. Of course, the third realm would be a significant threshold, but these children would definitely surpass the third realm eventually, just a matter of time and effort.

Leaning against the corridor pillar, Chen Ping'an watched the children, noticing that those who were eager to learn often came from impoverished backgrounds like Yan Qi Alley and Mu Meng Alley, while those who were less interested were usually from affluent families like Jiang Yun’s.

The children began practicing standing stances. Bai Mama occasionally helped them with their postures, and then one child would end up rolling on the ground, crying out in pain.

Watching this, Chen Ping'an, who had initially been calm, couldn't help but feel a sense of schadenfreude and chuckled.

However, seeing Yuan Zao Hua and a child from a poor alley fall to the ground in pain made him feel a twinge of sadness.

Bai Mama glanced over at her son-in-law's direction, her expression kind. The old woman’s gaze held a hint of inquiry.

Chen Ping'an quickly waved his hand, signaling that he was merely here to observe.

To his surprise, Bai Mama smiled and said, "Lord Hidden Official, someone here said they want to learn punches from you, complaining that my punching style is too delicate. Why don’t you teach them?"

Just as Chen Ping'an was about to decline, Jiang Yun raised his arms across his chest, shouting, "Where is the Hidden Official?!"

Damn it, who is the Hidden Official here?

Chen Ping'an glanced at the little boy who had sat up, silently raising a hand, his arm shaking as he wiped the dust and sweat from his face.

Bai Mama wore a smile.

Reluctantly, Chen Ping'an walked to the training ground.

He didn't do much, just briefly shared some insights on the six-step stance, keeping it concise. 

Jiang Yun thought he was just getting started, only for the young Hidden Official to fall silent. The child couldn't help but ask, "Is that it?"

Chen Ping'an nodded, "Punch theory is never too complex; it’s like how thinner books often contain greater knowledge."

He spoke only halfway.

In the philosophies of the Three Teachings and the Hundred Schools, the more fundamental the tenets, the more elaborate the annotations became over generations, eventually flourishing and becoming all-encompassing.

However, when dealing with children, the more intricate the explanation, the more bewildered they would become.

Bai Mama laughed, "Lord Hidden Official, if you’re not in a hurry to return to the summer palace, it's just about time for the standing practice to finish up. You could teach them the Shaking Mountain Punch stance."

With outsiders present, she naturally couldn’t call him son-in-law.

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment; staying here for half an hour would be fine, so he nodded in agreement. "This stance originates from the Shaking Mountain Punch."

Jiang Yun interjected, "Wait, that name isn’t impressive enough; Shaking Mountain? Aren’t all the sword cultivators of the Sword Qi Great Wall capable of leveling mountains with a single strike?"

Chen Ping'an smiled, "Then why don’t you teach me your punching technique?"

Jiang Yun frowned, "Speak properly and make some sense!"

Chen Ping'an chuckled knowingly and continued, "The name of the punch might not sound great, but let me elaborate a bit."

He broadly discussed the plight of martial artists in the Haoran world, stating that those not from prestigious backgrounds were often mixed in their techniques. As long as they could crack bricks and shatter stones with their punches, they were already doing quite well, so the term "Shaking Mountain" actually carried significant weight. His words mingled with his own observations, capturing the children’s attention. After all, it was a rare opportunity to slack off, avoiding the punishment of standing while dodging hits; who wouldn’t prefer that?

After finishing, Chen Ping'an demonstrated the stance a few times, helping the children correct their postures. After a stick of incense had burned, during the break, he first discussed the martial struggles in the city, then shared tales of the grandeur of martial artists at the peak of the ninth and tenth realms. The children loved hearing this, as the summer palace was essentially a cage; they couldn’t escape anyway. Jiang Yun once urged the little girl from Yu Hu Street to run away together. Just as they climbed the wall in the dead of night, they were dragged back by the ferocious wife of the innkeeper, punished to stand, causing the young girl to faint and Jiang Yun to fall asleep standing.

While Jiang Yun and the girl were being punished not far away, there were two children who proactively stood in stances, only to be quickly sent back by Bai Mama.

Training in martial arts should never be done to the point of exhaustion.

Whether one is poor in academics or rich in martial arts, training requires a good teacher to guide the way. Strengthening one’s body is also costly; otherwise, it’s easy to go astray, and practicing punches without proper guidance can lead to injuries and deplete one's vitality. Before the punch intent manifests, it feels like one is possessed by a ghost, which is the greatest suffering for many martial artists without a master to guide them.

Chen Ping'an gauged the time and took his leave.

Bai Mama continued to teach the children.

Jiang Yun muttered under his breath, "What a letdown when you meet them in person."

Bai Mama smiled, "When the day comes that you believe you’re worthy to ask the Hidden Official about punches, you’ll understand what despair truly means."

Jiang Yun shook his head, "Never mind. That shopkeeper is too clever. Once I reach a higher realm, if I catch up to him, I’ll definitely test the waters first. As long as he agrees to my request to spar, I won’t fight back."

Bai Mama shook her head. The Jiang family was rather straightforward; how did they raise such a foul-mouthed brat?

Jiang Yun glanced at the old woman, wondering what on earth his grandfather had seen in such a woman.

Chen Ping'an returned to the summer palace and then called upon Chou Miao, heading to the Spring Banner Hall of the Upside-Down Mountain, making a stop at the Plum Blossom Garden. The account book that the rosy-cheeked lady sent to the summer palace was quite substantial, so Chen Ping'an brought along two additional items from his trip to Upside-Down Mountain, borrowed from Yan Ming and Nalan Caihuan. In the empty Plum Blossom Garden, Chou Miao watched the eager Hidden Official moving things and couldn't help but ask, "Is this how you act in the Ning residence's treasury as well?"

Chen Ping'an couldn't be bothered to argue.

How could that be the same?

Upon reaching the Spring Banner Hall, he carefully reviewed the account books while Wei Wenlong quietly explained some of the nuances. Chen Ping'an noticed that Mi Yu the sword immortal seemed somewhat drowsy.

The outcome that Chou Miao and Lin Junbi had feared most had yet to materialize.

The ferryboats across the Eight Continents remained uninterrupted, enabling them to smoothly reach Upside-Down Mountain.

On their way, Chou Miao suggested they could raise their bids appropriately, and Chen Ping'an agreed, discussing the details with Yan Ming, Nalan Caihuan, and Shao Yunyan. Some key resource prices remained unchanged, or else the financial flow of the Sword Qi Great Wall would be under too much pressure. Even with the substantial assets of the Spring Banner Hall and Plum Blossom Garden added in, it still fell short. However, for some of the second-rate "extra" supplies from each ferryboat, they could afford to provide more concessions, taking it step by step.

Upon returning to the Sword Qi Great Wall, this was Chen Ping'an's first close encounter with the mirage to the north of the city. He didn't step inside but merely observed from afar.

Chou Miao looked up at the sky and conveyed through thought, "Setting aside the strength of your strikes, can you achieve the level of the elder sword immortal?"

Chen Ping'an shook his head, "It’s difficult to achieve."

Over at the Sword Qi Great Wall, Ning Yao's group of sword cultivators led the way back to the city.

Everyone was injured, with Die Zhang suffering the most.

Chen Qingdu stepped out of the straw hut.

Chen Sanqiu called out to his ancestor, and Chen Qingdu responded with an "Mm."

That was all.

If an outsider were to encounter the Chen Sanqiu during a drinking session, it would be hard to imagine that this charming young drunkard was actually the descendant of Chen Qingdu.

The elder sword immortal Chen Xi had once privately inquired of the ancestor Chen Qingdu whether he could allow Chen Sanqiu to leave and follow some Confucian sage to study in the Haoran world.

Chen Qingdu only asked one question.

Would Chen Sanqiu still carry the Chen surname afterward?

Ultimately, Chen Xi left the city wall in disappointment.

Chen Sanqiu respectfully took his leave and was the first to mount his sword and depart.

The Chen clan's descendants had always been like this.

Having an ancestor proficient in swordsmanship was tantamount to not having one, or even worse.

Dong Hua Fu, Yan Zhuo, and the others also took their leave, planning to return to the city for a few days of recuperation, while Die Zhang needed a longer time to recover.

Only Ning Yao remained.

Chen Ping'an flew his sword to the city wall.

Sitting beside Ning Yao on the city wall, Chen Ping'an gently swung his legs.

Ning Yao asked, "For the past year or so, you've been staying in the summer palace, hiding your thoughts and avoiding me?"

Chen Ping'an hesitated.

Ning Yao said, "Unless you’ve developed feelings for someone else, there's nothing you can't say."

Chen Ping'an chuckled wryly, remaining silent for a moment before saying, "I hadn’t planned to talk about it, but I suddenly realized that what I thought was best might just turn out to be the worst. After all, when two people like each other, it’s really not just one person’s matter. So I thought I should discuss it with you. After you hear it, you can hit me, but don’t get angry."

After hearing this, Ning Yao nodded.

Chen Ping'an shared what he had discussed with the elder sword immortal regarding a certain promise.

Ning Yao didn’t respond.

Chen Ping'an softly asked, "Not angry?"

Ning Yao countered, "What’s the use of being angry?"

Chen Ping'an thought for a moment and realized it seemed to be of no use.

He just didn’t dare to say that.

Ning Yao raised an eyebrow.

That was that.

She didn’t have to say it explicitly.

Chen Ping'an gently tapped his heels against the wall.

Being with Ning Yao, as well as everything that had happened before—from meeting her to liking her, then walking to her side, traversing mountains and rivers, and traveling far—could be tiring, but it would never be exhausting to his heart.

Ning Yao asked, "If you have such heavy matters in the future, just say it directly. Even if I get angry, I will let you know."

Chen Ping'an gently held her hand, and the two of them quietly gazed into the distance.

Chen Qingdu took a stroll, never going too far, walking slowly and then returning along the same path.

He glanced at the silhouettes of the young couple in the distance.

Chen Qingdu smiled, recalling a very interesting little incident.

The reason he had a good impression of Chen Ping'an when they first met years ago had nothing to do with anything.

It had nothing to do with Chen Ping'an daring to ask Cao Ci three rounds of punches—he could throw punches and could admit defeat; it didn't matter. 

It had nothing to do with the young man traveling alone to the Sword Qi Great Wall to deliver a sword to the girl he loved, either.

Even the connection between Chen Ping'an and that senior had nothing to do with it.

Chen Qingdu had seen that originally gifted young man, whose potential had been broken at the Bridge of Eternal Life, particularly when he looked into the boy’s eyes, full of vitality, which made Chen Qingdu feel... both amused and exasperated.

Unlike many old martial artists and senior figures who viewed Chen Ping'an with disappointment, Chen Qingdu might be the only one who saw Chen Ping'an as lively and full of vigor.

Years ago, when he was still a teenager, Chen Ping'an seemed to be silently asking the universe with an exuberant spirit.

Am I truly capable of becoming a great sword immortal? Can I make the girl I like love me and continue to love me? Can I protect the girl I like? Will I definitely not disappoint certain people? I can surely achieve all this, right?!

Chen Qingdu thought that was quite wonderful.

No wonder that old scholar had relentlessly pursued him before leaving, asking again and again, "Is my closed-door disciple good? Are you envious? I’m genuinely envious, aren’t I? Alas, it’s a pity I can’t be envious! If I were your brother Chen, I’d have given you a punch right away, otherwise, how could I quell my resentment?!"

 ### Chapter 766: Unknowingly Fifteen Years

At the Bull Horn Mountain Ferry, it was no longer just the military ferries of the Great Li transporting troops back and forth; more and more merchant vessels were coming and going. 

Pei Qian’s eyes sparkled, imagining all the heavenly coins rolling into Master’s pocket. 

On this trip "far from home," since they were on familiar territory, the girl in black beside Pei Qian, shouldering a small burden and holding a hiking staff, felt she couldn't possibly look more impressive. 

Zhou Mili felt a twinge of regret that she couldn’t stick two pieces of paper to her forehead—one labeled "Right Guardian of the Fallen Mountain" and the other "Mysterious Lake Monster." 

Not far away, Chen Nuanshu was chatting about trivial matters with Chen Lingjun, who was about to set off for North Julu Continent, and she noticed that Chen Lingjun kept yawning. 

Pei Qian crossed her arms, glancing around at her master's beautiful landscape, nodding in satisfaction. 

Zhou Mili quietly asked, “Chen Lingjun is leaving soon, shouldn’t we say a few words? Maybe shed a few tears to show our sincerity?” 

Pei Qian rolled her eyes. “Did you eat the Fallen Mountain’s rules for breakfast or something?” 

Pei Qian freed a hand to pat the little winter melon’s head and said earnestly, “My master once said, ‘Reason is like a big white bowl; everything else is just food to fill it. As long as the bowl doesn’t get lost, we can always find something to eat.’ But what exactly is ‘reason’? I can’t figure it out, and you, with your muddled brain, definitely can’t either. So we just need to remember the rules of Fallen Mountain, and we won’t go wrong.” 

Zhou Mili furrowed her brow but soon relaxed, understanding. She whispered, “Once we talk to Chen Lingjun, we’ll need to give him a parting gift, right? But we’re already so close, so let’s skip the pretentious stuff!” 

Pei Qian playfully tugged Zhou Mili’s cheek and laughed heartily, “What are you talking about?” 

Zhou Mili giggled along with her. 

Pei Qian stood still, taking a deep breath, then began to throw punches slowly, muttering to herself, “A single finger pokes a needle, a punch sweeps a wide area; throwing punches is like shooting arrows, retracting punches is like flying swords…” 

Zhou Mili asked, “What are you doing?” 

Pei Qian continued her slow punches, solemnly declaring, “After the Mad Sword Technique, I’ve created my own exceptional boxing style, and the mantra is all of my own making. It’s incredibly powerful.” 

Then Pei Qian started rambling, “In the world of boxing, aside from my master’s techniques being the strongest, there are two others that are quite formidable: one is the self-taught ‘Turtle Boxing,’ and the other is learned from the Bridge Sect.” 

Zhou Mili felt she wasn’t foolish; she just had her doubts, “So what makes your boxing so special? If you practice it, can you fly?” 

Pei Qian replied irritably, “That’s something only a martial artist at the Realm of Wandering can achieve. I’m still far from that; it’ll take years of hard work.” 

Zhou Mili stomped her foot, frustrated. “So long! How many sunflower seeds will I have to eat to get there?” 

Pei Qian sighed helplessly, “You think becoming an Eighth Realm martial artist is easy?” 

Zhou Mili looked momentarily stunned, holding her hiking staff and scratching her cheek, “But you’re Pei Qian!” 

Pei Qian beamed, withdrawing her fists and ruffling little Mili’s hair, “You little airhead, you may look small, but you’re quite sharp!” 

Zhou Mili swayed her head back and forth for a while before suddenly sighing, “Why hasn’t the Mountain Lord returned home yet?” 

Pei Qian smiled, “Didn’t I tell you? Over at the Sword Qi Great Wall, thanks to Master promoting you, there are now countless stories about the Mysterious Lake Monster circulating. That’s a whole other world! You should just enjoy it.” 

Zhou Mili began scratching her cheek again, “But I’d rather he not tell stories and come back sooner.” 

Pei Qian made a face, “When Master comes home, will you treat him to some pickled fish?” 

Zhou Mili frowned, timidly saying, “Just a small bowl, not a big one?” 

Pei Qian laughed but felt a tinge of melancholy. 

As they grew up, it became increasingly difficult to experience life as they once did. All the little worries felt like guests knocking on the door to one’s heart—they came quickly, but left just as fast. 

Pei Qian used to struggle to understand why Master didn’t want her and Sister Baoping to grow up too fast. 

Now, watching little Mili, Pei Qian finally understood. 

As Chen Lingjun prepared to board the intercontinental ferry, Pei Qian patted Zhou Mili’s head, “Come on, let’s say goodbye. Remember, Master said that if a friend is taking the fairy ferry on a long journey, we can’t wish them a smooth sailing.” 

Zhou Mili nodded vigorously, “Got it, got it!” 

A silly Chen Nuanshu, along with Pei Qian and little Mili, bid him farewell. 

Chen Lingjun felt a bit awkward but was also somewhat pleased, though he didn’t want to show it on his face. 

After Chen Lingjun left, the three of them waited until the ferry disappeared into the sea of clouds before returning to Fallen Mountain. 

Chen Nuanshu turned back to take a glance at the sea of clouds. 

Pei Qian softly said, “Don’t worry, everything will be fine. Chen Lingjun may seem careless, but he’s actually quite clever.” 

Chen Nuanshu smiled. Pei Qian took one girl by each hand. 

Now Pei Qian had outgrown both of them significantly. 

Finally, she was starting to look like a young woman. 

Inside the ferry, Chen Lingjun had nothing to do and was simply resting his head on the table in a daze. 

In fact, the moment Chen Lingjun stepped onto the intercontinental ferry bound for the Bridge Sect, he regretted it. He wanted nothing more than to jump off the ferry and sneak back. After all, with Fallen Mountain's vast territory, he could easily find a place to hide. It was likely that Wei Ban would find him annoying and wouldn’t want to bother with the old cook or Pei Qian. After a few days, he could just show up at Fallen Mountain with some excuse, casually pick a lucky day on the calendar, and forget about the Mysterious Lake, not even saying goodbye to his friends in Jianghu. Staying home and diligently practicing his cultivation didn’t seem so bad… 

On the table rested a large bamboo box, which was a rare display of generosity from Wei Daxian, who had even lent him a small item. 

Inside the box were many maps of North Julu Continent, some drawn by celestial beings on the mountain and some secret documents from various government offices, alongside a jumble of local records, as well as a few booklets personally penned by Chen Ping’an containing numerous important notes. As the old cook would say, it was as if he had written down every little detail, even where to relieve oneself. If he couldn’t successfully traverse Jianghu with all this, he might as well drown. 

Chen Lingjun was actually still scared. 

Previously, when he was at the Yujiang area of Huangting Kingdom, he didn’t like moving around. He had recognized the Yujiang Water God as a brother and enjoyed his share of power alongside him. Upon arriving at Fallen Mountain, he didn’t move either. Pei Qian and Zhou Mili would occasionally visit Hongzhu Town, but Chen Lingjun stuck around the surrounding hills of Fallen Mountain, wandering about, chatting aimlessly with the old celestial neighbors, and patrolling with that black snake, living a carefree life. 

Ever since that blind old man named Jia Cheng moved from Qilong Alley to Huang Lake Mountain to cultivate, Chen Lingjun often visited him. They got along well, and if bragging really had an effect, the entire Haoran world would be their private garden. 

However, Chen Lingjun was now clear that the other party treated him well primarily because of Chen Ping’an’s influence. 

Chen Lingjun didn’t dislike this arrangement; in fact, he enjoyed it. 

Even with the good atmosphere at Fallen Mountain, there were still distinctions between those who were close and those who were distant. 

He and Nuanshu, that little silly girl, were among the earliest “elders” of Fallen Mountain. 

Later came the old cook, Pei Qian, Shi Rou, and others, including that silly Ceng Yuanji, the naive girl Yuanbao, and the dimwit Yuanlai. Afterward, Chen Ping’an even brought back little Mili from North Julu Continent. 

Sometimes Chen Lingjun felt that these guys, like Wei Ban, looked down on him. It was no wonder they had such lofty aspirations; he could only blame himself for being complacent, enjoying a life of leisure, and boasting. 

There were many people and the atmosphere was lively—what a good thing. 

Being all alone and running all the way to North Julu Continent to cultivate? 

What a waste of time—Pale Bone Marsh, the Bridge Sect, the Mural City, Master Zhu Quan, and those two named offerings from Fallen Mountain—what a mess! The Mysterious Lake, Liu Zhiqing, Spring Dew Garden, Cloud City, the river spirit, Central Dragon Palace, and the farthest mountain… not to mention Lion Peak, the couple Li Er, Li Huai’s sister Li Liu, little Baoping’s brother Li Xisheng, and the Fire God Temple where his friend Liu Jinglong from Taihui Sword Sect was… 

Was he really heading towards a bright future by cultivating? Or was he going door to door, making visits and delivering gifts? 

He had to jump on a ferry! 

Chen Lingjun gathered his belongings and slipped down to the ferry's lower deck. Just then, Wei Ban appeared out of thin air near the ferry’s railing. 

Chen Lingjun laughed heartily, “Wei Daxian, why so polite? No need to send me off!” 

Wei Ban smiled, “The entire North Yue territory is under my jurisdiction; have you forgotten?” 

Chen Lingjun scampered over to rub Wei Ban’s arm eagerly, “How could I forget? Even if I had to pee, I’d hold it in, afraid of sullying the beauty of North Yue!” 

Wei Ban said, “The Mountain of the Crown Prince of North Yue is located at the northernmost tip of Baoping Continent. I’ll have a word with that mountain god and see you off as the ferry sets sail. After that, you’re free to jump whenever you like. You can take your time returning, and whether you land on Eastern Yue’s territory or Gan Prefecture Mountain depends on your mood.” 

Chen Lingjun was dumbfounded. 

In the bustling Qinfeng City, year after year, the celebrations continued unabated. Dynasties rose and fell, landscapes changed, but this city built at the foot of the mountain remained steadfast. One emperor after another showed great respect towards the Xu family. 

The Xu family had established a grand connection through their ancestor, allowing them to possess a fox kingdom worth half a blessed land. 

It was said that the fox fairy encountered by the Xu family’s ancestor back then already had seven tails—whether that number had increased since was unknown. 

The beautiful fox-fur beauties produced by the Xu family in Qinfeng City were priced exorbitantly, prized for their rarity and in high demand. 

They were a unique treasure of Baoping Continent, and as the intercontinental ferries between North Julu and Qinfeng City became more frequent, the Xu family’s wealth grew immensely. Especially in recent years, the head of the Xu family changed ancestral practices, allowing the fox kingdom to open the Mirror Flower Water Moon. One fox-fur talisman now commanded a price double that of before. 

The Xu family invited renowned artists to create the Four Beauties and Eighteen Maidens series, either through meticulous engravings or careful copies, along with a smattering of scholarly items like folding fans, which once released, sold out immediately. 

Some celestial beings on the mountain who weren’t fond of Qinfeng City expressed envy, claiming that Xu Hun was on the verge of selling spring palace paintings. If Xu Hun dared to sell those, then he would truly be a hero. 

They deliberately belittled Xu Hun, calling him a man who rolls in the realm of cosmetics. 

However, this man was, in reality, a formidable Yuanying realm warrior, and after acquiring that peculiar pockmarked armor, he became even more powerful, uniquely capable of outstanding feats among those below the Fifth Realm on Baoping Continent. 

In a private room of a tavern in the bustling city center, a young man continued to dine while a scholarly figure in a blue gown had already put down his chopsticks, standing by the window and watching the bustling street outside, filled with beautiful women. 

Liu Chicheng waved a folding fan, smiling, “This couple from Qinfeng City, one focuses on cultivation while the other manages finances, truly a perfect match.” 

The young man simply buried his head in his food. Liu Chicheng rarely touched his own chopsticks but ordered an entire table of dishes, leaving plenty left over. 

Liu Chicheng turned to the young man and asked with a smile, “Gu Can, you’ve never said why you wanted to come here and deliberately avoid Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi. Can you tell me now?” 

Gu Can paused his eating, swallowed, and looked up to say, “I have a friend who was almost killed by a man named Lu Zhengchun. That Lu Zhengchun is from the Lu family on Fortune Street, and it seems he’s been doing well in Qinfeng City with the Xu family.” 

In Li Zhu Cave, the major clans among the top ten surnames—Song, Li, Zhao, and Lu—were all great families. 

However, the small-town Lu family had too many ties to the fallen dynasty, suffering the most severe consequences. After Li Zhu Cave fell to the earth, the little town Lu family was left with nothing to show for it. 

Only Lu Zhengchun had followed a woman from the Xu family in Qinfeng City when he left the town in his youth. The Xu family treated him well, providing ample cultivation resources and even granting him a direct lineage identity as a protective talisman; they gave him face. 

Liu Chicheng had no interest in Lu Zhengchun, but he curiously asked, “Someone like you actually has friends?” 

Gu Can nodded, “I do have one.” 

Liu Chicheng chuckled, “It’s only Chen Ping’an, isn’t it?” 

Gu Can shook his head, “He has never regarded me as a friend; the age difference is too great. To me, he feels more like a half-relative. As for Liu Xianyang, he only became closer to me because of Chen Ping’an. Otherwise, we’ve never been on the same path, not in the past, and won’t be in the future. So he’s barely a friend.” 

When Liu Xianyang returns from Nanshuo Continent, he should become the direct disciple of the Dragon Spring Sword Sect’s Ruan Qiong. Liu Xianyang was brought away from home because his ancestors were the Chen family’s tomb keepers. 

What Gu Can admired most about Liu Xianyang was his innate ability to adapt to his surroundings, never suffering from any discomfort. 

As for himself, once he arrived at the Book and Letter Lake, he had lost his greatest asset—patience—completely. 

Looking back at that seemingly glorious time on Qingxia Island, Gu Can realized he had been walking step by step towards a dead end. 

Being young was no excuse. 

Gu Can looked at the dishes on the table and resumed eating. 

Suddenly, Liu Chicheng said, “Once you reach Baidi City, it’s best to sever these ties.” 

Gu Can remained calm, eating without saying a word. 

Liu Chicheng didn’t believe he could change Gu Can’s character; it would probably depend on his older brother’s teaching methods. He changed the subject, “Earlier, when you said ‘doing well,’ how well is that? Since he’s around your age, is he a Jindan Sword Cultivator? Or a Yuanying Qi Practitioner?” 

Gu Can replied, “Currently, he’s a Fourth Realm Qi Practitioner. Within ten years, he hopes to reach the Cave Dwelling realm. He helps the Xu family manage a small part of the trade from the fox kingdom. His cultivation isn’t fast, but he can pile it up with heavenly coins.” 

Liu Chicheng closed his folding fan and tapped his own head, laughing, “Future little brother, are you kidding me or telling a joke?” 

Gu Can’s expression was calm; he didn’t drink, ate slowly, and savored each bite. “If killing someone means I have to run away, will I ever have a stable place to settle down in this life?” 

Liu Chicheng was dumbfounded, laughing and shaking his head. “A waste of space like you, and you think you’re worth killing? I’m easy to talk to; just nod, and I’ll deal with it for you. It’s just one Xu Hun; not even at Fifth Realm, it’s a trivial matter.” 

Gu Can retorted, “What if? Why take the risk?” 

Liu Chicheng fell silent. 

Gu Can put down his chopsticks and smiled, “But if I really have to deal with an enemy, I’ll make sure there’s no one left to collect the body.” 

Furthermore, he had to ensure that no one could find fault. 

As for others, there were only two types—Chen Ping’an and everyone else. If he had to choose, he wouldn’t care about the latter. 

In any case, Chen Ping’an would never be able to completely sever ties with him in this lifetime. 

Liu Chicheng grinned brightly. 

This kid was growing more and more likable. 

Being a protector was just like a maiden stepping into the bridal sedan for the first time; it was only a matter of willingness, and he found it quite comfortable. 

This made Liu Chicheng ponder about taking a disciple. 

Gu Can asked, “If I really become your little brother, can I learn the most outstanding techniques and divine abilities?” 

Liu Chicheng chuckled, “Baidi City has a rich collection, so if you become my little brother, you can certainly learn; you can pick whatever you want. Whether you can master it is another matter.” 

Gu Can said, “I want to learn it all.” 

Liu Chicheng pointed his folding fan at Gu Can and laughed, “You’re young and ignorant, dreaming foolish dreams.” 

It wasn’t that he didn’t know Gu Can had excellent cultivation aptitude; otherwise, he wouldn’t have thought of taking him to Central Divine Continent as a stepping stone for reentering Baidi City. However, his older brother’s Baidi City was no ordinary dojo. 

Liu Chicheng had deep grievances against his older brother, but he didn’t bring up those old grudges. His brother was indeed the person Liu Chicheng most respected in his life. 

After that came Grand Master of Longhu Mountain, and then there was Cui Chen, with whom he had played the game of colorful clouds. 

Just these three. 

Liu Chicheng couldn’t help but remind him, “My older brother is unpredictable; you might just reach the pinnacle of success or fall into the mundane world, or worse, lose several lifetimes. Don’t think it will come easy. My older brother once spent six hundred years polishing a potential closed-door disciple. For that poor soul, it was eight lifetimes spent making garments for the last lifetime’s Baidi City disciple. In the end, when that person reached their ninth lifetime, for some reason, they were still abandoned by my older brother. He is best at multitasking—cultivating, playing chess, managing Baidi City, refining tools, and taking on disciples... He excels at everything and remains composed in every aspect.” 

Gu Can nodded, “Then I’ve found a good master.” 

Liu Chicheng laughed heartily. 

Gu Can stood up to settle the bill. 

Suddenly, Liu Chicheng exclaimed, “What a stunning girl!” 

Gu Can didn’t pay attention. 

Liu Chicheng exclaimed in surprise, “Not often seen, not often seen. That silver-white gourd, if I’m not mistaken, is one of the highest-ranked seven sword-nurturing gourds.” 

Gu Can frowned, quickly walking to the window to look at the young woman leisurely walking by with a red dress, hanging a wine gourd at her waist and wielding a narrow blade. 

It was Li Baoping. 

Why was she in Qinfeng City? 

Gu Can said, “We’re in no rush to leave; let’s wait until she leaves Qinfeng City before we go. Regardless of any disturbances during this time, I owe you a favor.” 

Liu Chicheng asked in confusion, “Do you know this girl?” 

Gu Can remained silent. 

Liu Chicheng calculated and suddenly cursed, quickly covering his nose, which was still bleeding. 

His expression turned serious, and he rarely showed such seriousness, “Don’t get involved! Consider this a suggestion from your future little brother!” 

Gu Can gazed at the red-dressed woman’s retreating figure, replying, “I must get involved. If something happens, you save her, and I’ll take care of myself.” 

Liu Chicheng glared, “What are you thinking?!” 

Gu Can closed his eyes, beginning to calculate everything about the intelligence in Qinfeng City. 

Liu Chicheng sighed, leaning against the window, self-deprecating, “This busy life of mine…” 

Before Zheng Dafu went to the Yang family shop, he visited a tavern, where the liquor vendor was an old friend. They were still a bit short of being lovers. 

The woman was bold, and the townsfolk called her Huang Erniang; her real name had long been forgotten. 

Years ago, when a drunken man knocked on the widow’s door at night, she opened the door and swung a kitchen knife, nearly chopping him to death. Afterward, she paid a hefty sum, but after that incident, men who used to hang around her, even daring to peek over the wall, all disappeared. For the sake of the second son, risking the life of the eldest didn’t seem worth it. 

Moreover, in the tavern, Huang Erniang didn’t mind any crude banter; it was all back and forth, mostly men begging for mercy. When serving food and drink, she would let drunkards touch her hand, but they’d only receive a kick in return and a few playful curses. This business was profitable; if a handsome young man came in to drink, the treatment would be different. The bolder ones wouldn’t even receive a glance. Ultimately, who was taking advantage of whom was open to interpretation. 

The tavern thrived, bustling with patrons. Years ago, Master Ruan, who had transformed from a blacksmith to a celestial being, often came here to buy liquor. Over time, Huang Erniang’s drinks became a golden signboard for the little town, drawing many outsiders hoping to bask in the divine aura of the Great Li’s foremost offering, Ruan Shengren. The business was flourishing, much like the cakes from the auspicious shop in Qilong Alley, which were also thriving. 

Zheng Dafu stood outside the shop, feeling a bit troubled. With so many scruffy men staring, he guessed Huang Erniang would definitely feel too embarrassed to tease him. Moreover, now that the shop had expanded, hiring two workers, Zheng Dafu felt that drinking wasn’t as enjoyable as before. 

It was not like when the shop was quiet, and he was its biggest patron. When Huang Erniang saw him, it was as if she had seen her own man return home. She would always sway her hips, round the counter, and greet him with “Dafu Brother.” Sometimes she’d pinch his arm and whisper a few words of playful scolding, making him feel like a piece of peach blossom cake. 

She insisted on wrapping her arm around his as they entered the shop. How could such a heavy weapon exist in the world? It was quite painful; Zheng Dafu was afraid he’d hurt his arm. Every time he sat down, he had to rub it for a long time before he could lift the wine bowl. 

With seven or eight tables filled with people, Zheng Dafu planned to return when it was less crowded. Unexpectedly, at one table, all local men were present, and one of them waved, “Yo yo yo, isn’t this Dafu Brother? Come sit with us, but let’s be clear, you’re treating today. How many drinks have you mooched from us at every wedding? Now that you’re helping the celestial beings on the mountain, what a big shot! Truly, when a man has money, he stands tall.” 

Zheng Dafu, whose stature was hunched, hurried over to sit on the long bench next to them, laughing, “What do I treat? I’m saving up for a wife, not like you, Liu Dazhong, who sold two ancestral houses and bought two big houses and several shops in the state capital all at once!” 

“Dazhong” was a local term meaning someone who is clueless. 

The Liu man wasn’t angry; he was used to bantering with Zheng Dafu, and their back-and-forth was just a lighthearted exchange—whoever got angry lost the match. 

The man hadn’t visited the town in years; he had sold both large ancestral houses long ago and didn’t dwell on the past. When visiting the graves, he used to pass by but later became too lazy to even visit the grave mound. The road was too far; during the Qingming Festival, he just burned more yellow paper outside the big house in the state capital, thinking he had fulfilled his filial duty. 

The man lowered his voice, “Did you know that widow in Mud Bottle Alley is doing quite well now? She’s genuinely rich and noble.” 

He raised his thumb, “In terms of family background, that charming widow can be compared to none.” 

He immediately regretted it, “If I had known back then, I would have tried harder. Now, in the state capital, I could have had not just a few houses and shops but entire streets under my name!” 

Zheng Dafu poured himself a bowl of wine, which wasn’t as good as the liquor personally served by Huang Erniang. The taste was lacking. Zheng Dafu raised his wine bowl, toasting the whole table, downing it in one gulp. The few present were about the same age as Liu Dazhong, former neighbors who had all built their own businesses in the state capital and were enjoying lives they hadn’t even dared to dream about before. The old-faced women who entered first and the younger, alluring concubines made for a lively household, with the occasional witty maid adding to the noise—every day was busier than the previous New Year’s celebration. 

Zheng Dafu raised his wine glass, and aside from one relatively honest acquaintance who returned the toast, the others ignored him, pretending not to see. 

Zheng Dafu didn’t care; he was just there to drink for free—what did he have to lose? 

He quickly poured another bowl of wine, wiping his mouth and smiling, “Not too clear. I wasn’t very familiar with the Gu family’s lady back then, as you know.” 

Liu Dazhong teased, “I find it strange. They’re both charming widows, but the Gu lady in Mud Bottle Alley is soft-natured. Why didn’t you try to court her? Why only Huang Erniang?” 

Zheng Dafu chuckled. 

Another man on the long bench, known for being shrewd and miserly, casually asked, “Dafu, I heard you’ve been hanging around with that kid from Mud Bottle Alley? Your prospects look dimmer now, huh? Once a door guard, you’re now just helping a younger generation. Aren’t you ashamed? Besides, with your current situation, it doesn’t look like you’re doing well. Why don’t I lend you a hand? We’ve been good brothers for years, and you still have that little shack on the east side of town, right? I can help you find a wealthy buyer in the state capital.” 

Zheng Dafu just started to mix the ingredients and didn’t refuse; he dragged it along, knowing he could still drink for free next time they met. 

In the end, the entire table lost patience with Zheng Dafu, and when they left, they didn’t settle the bill. 

Zheng Dafu called over a familiar face, who then called over his own acquaintances to drink, and Zheng Dafu thought it was time to slip away. 

He didn’t expect the woman to be sharp-eyed, smiling, “Dafu Brother, are you short on cash or just lacking something else? If it’s cash and you can’t pay the bill, we’re good friends, so just forget about it. But if you’re lacking something else, I can’t help you.” 

Zheng Dafu kept walking, pretending not to hear. 

Huang Erniang slammed her hand on the table, “Zheng Dafu! Get back here! You think you can eat my tofu and not pay? You think the King of Heaven lent you the guts to do that?” 

Zheng Dafu turned around, sauntering over to the counter, and said softly, “Short on cash, short on cash. When am I not short on cash? As for the other stuff, Huang Erniang, you should know me well enough. I’m the courageous and robust Zheng Dafu, not just a name.” 

Huang Erniang leaned against the counter, munching on melon seeds, “Why aren’t you gambling anymore? Did you fall into the pigsty?” 

Zheng Dafu laughed, “I gamble just for fun, never to make money. Have you ever seen me win at gambling?” 

Then Zheng Dafu added earnestly, “Money earned at the gambling table is just a piece of farmland by the river. Life and death money, after turning for sixty years. A skillful trade, money from craftsmanship, three generations of inheritance. A small piece of land, farming money, lasting for thousands of years.” 

Huang Erniang rolled her eyes, “You just love pretending to be a scholar.” 

Zheng Dafu glanced at the woman’s attire and reached out, “Miss, what fabric is this? So sturdy, let me have a look.” 

The woman just continued eating her melon seeds, not dodging or avoiding him. She truly didn’t believe this guy would dare to touch the fabric on her chest. 

As expected, Zheng Dafu withdrew his hand, feigning innocence. He wiped the table and complained, “Miss, it’s not that I’m scolding you, but you really should find someone more diligent to help out. Look at this table, it’s greasy; even a fly would struggle to take off. If you’re not careful, you could end up crushed by two mountains.” 

The woman merely scoffed, “You have the nerve to call me ‘Miss’? Count how long it’s been since you took care of this shop!” 

Zheng Dafu leaned on the counter, turning to look at the noisy tables, laughing, “What’s the point of taking care of it now? It’s not like I need those few bowls of wine.” 

As he spoke, the woman, seizing the opportunity while the hunched man was looking elsewhere, had her eyes turn red for a moment, but she quickly concealed it. 

In the blink of an eye, many years had passed. 

When she first opened this shop, she was still a young girl, even prettier than she was now, without those crow's feet at the corners of her eyes, and her hands were still tender. She recalled the days she bravely served drinks to guests, with nearly all the drunkards’ eyes fixed on her chest, except for one young man, who not only looked at her chest but also admired her delicate hands, saying many charming words that sounded like they came from a book—words she couldn’t quite comprehend, but they brought joy to her heart. 

The shop managed to survive the early years of hardship, and that young man helped a lot, not just by drinking. 

However, when she was at her most beautiful, she was too busy being flattered by those words. Now, as she aged, she understood more about human affairs, and she wasn’t as beautiful anymore. 

She only felt that Zheng Dafu was different from other men. 

Both his eyes and mouth were indeed not honest, but his hands were honest. 

The woman only learned much later that he was the true honest man. 

Zheng Dafu turned around, “Old habit, put it on the tab, and by the way, give me another bowl.” 

The woman slammed the bowl on the table, personally scooping wine into it. Facing the wine jar, as she turned and bent over, she knew that man was definitely watching her. 

Huang Erniang poured the wine and leaned back against the counter, looking at the man taking small sips, softly saying, “That Liu Dazhong and his group are eyeing your house; be careful. It might be that they came back to the town specifically for you this time.” 

Zheng Dafu nodded, “You’re still caring.” 

“Don’t take it lightly,” she urged, her tone slightly more serious as she frowned, “I’ve heard that these people have money now, and they’re not so respectable in the state capital. Money in good people’s hands is heroic, but in the hands of these scoundrels, it becomes a tool for harm. Your little house may be small, but the location is good. Just east of the town is the Immortal Tomb, which has now turned into a Martial Temple. Over the years, how many high-ranking officials have gone to burn incense and worship? How impressive? Don’t you know? But I also want to advise you, if you find a suitable buyer, just sell it; don’t hold on too tightly. Be careful if the authorities come to buy; when that happens, the price will drop. If it falls too low, will you sell or not? If you don’t sell, will your life be peaceful?” 

Zheng Dafu grunted in acknowledgment. 

If we’re talking about dirty secrets and annoying matters, there are plenty in the marketplace, and every household has its share of filth. But if we talk about those who are clever and kind-hearted, there’s a whole lot of them. Every household has a few bowls of clean rice, right? 

Suddenly, the woman felt a wave of sadness. “We’re getting old.” 

Zheng Dafu laughed, “That’s true; your son is now a scholar, right? I heard he’s even earned the nickname ‘Little Scholar’? How about it, Dafu Brother never lies; that kid looks like a good material, a proper seed of knowledge. The Spring Festival couplets at the tavern were written by him, right? Quite impressive; you should just look forward to enjoying the blessings. The family treasure lies not in wealth but in the good deeds one accumulates.” 

Huang Erniang glanced at him. 

Zheng Dafu pretended to be shy, blocking his face with the wine bowl, “Miss, your gaze isn’t very proper; Dafu Brother feels like he’s walking out without clothes on.” 

Huang Erniang had no choice but to roll her eyes. 

She truly had to thank him for teaching her about raising children. In those early days when the young widow was carrying a little burden, she truly felt like she would rather cut off her flesh than let the child eat well and dress warmly. As the child grew older, she couldn’t bear to scold him at all, and he became wild, daring to skip school. She felt it wasn’t right but didn’t know how to teach him; she urged him, but he didn’t listen. Every time he promised to do better, he still often went to the river to catch fish or climbed mountains to catch snakes. 

Then one time Zheng Dafu was drinking and joking around, he concealed a saying: “To earn money, one must be precise; be generous to others, but be strict with one’s descendants.” 

Huang Erniang took that to heart. After a thorough beating, the child became obedient. 

Suddenly, Huang Erniang said, “Half-heartedness leads to indecisiveness; there are all sorts of chaos. What a coward.” 

This had once been Zheng Dafu’s way of cursing at the tavern. 

In reality, it didn’t have much force; it was overly sour and didn’t hurt or itch. 

However, Huang Erniang found it amusing and remembered it. Unlike the women who would scold first and scratch later, and those rural men, their insults seemed to come from a different place. 

Zheng Dafu pretended he didn’t understand and began to lament, “A single man’s woes, cold and lonely. How poor am I? Even a starving mouse has to move away. Mosquitoes and lice can barely sip on a little wine. After saving enough for a wife, which girl would be willing to come knocking?” 

Huang Erniang laughed, asking, “What age girl are you looking for?” 

Zheng Dafu glanced at the woman, grinning, “Age doesn’t matter; as long as they’re old enough, it’s fine.” 

Huang Erniang threw a handful of melon seeds at him. 

Zheng Dafu dodged, and there was a time to finish the wine bowl. Putting it down, he patted his face, “What a saying: ‘Drinking like a long whale sucking streams; drunkenness like a jade mountain about to collapse.’ Miss, you’re fortunate.” 

Huang Erniang scoffed, “You’re just a simpleton. If you get drunk and fall into a latrine, drown, or eat to the point of bursting, it’s all on you.” 

Zheng Dafu replied, “I’m leaving now; I’ll definitely settle the debt later.” 

Huang Erniang suddenly asked, “Are you going far?” 

Zheng Dafu replied, “Not too far.” 

That lotus root blessed land wasn’t far, just near Fallen Mountain. 

Huang Erniang lowered her voice, “Haven’t you suffered enough? What’s so good out there?” 

Zheng Dafu turned his head and smiled, “I once saw a saying in a book: ‘Huang Si Niang’s flowers bloom along the path; they can’t compare to Huang Erniang.’” 

Huang Erniang asked, “Can’t you just stay? The wine bill is still outstanding.” 

Zheng Dafu shook his head and left. 

The woman watched as the man, who had his arm around another, gradually walked away, until he became increasingly indistinct. 

Zheng Dafu arrived at the Yang family shop to lend a hand. His sharp-witted junior sister Su Dian and the clueless junior brother Shi Ling Shan had both gone out to gain experience. 

Currently, only a Yang family descendant was watching over the shop. Zheng Dafu had thickened his skin over the years; although he still received no warm treatment from his master, it was fine as long as he stayed in the front shop, avoiding the back courtyard where the old man was. 

Approaching the shop, Zheng Dafu discreetly dispersed the smell of alcohol from his body. As he entered, the young assistant was dozing off. Hearing Zheng Dafu move a small stool, he woke up only to fall back asleep. The Yang family had been annoyed with Zheng Dafu for years, not wanting to get involved with him, a door guard who returned after nearly losing half his life on a distant trip, only to continue guarding the door. How much potential could he have? If not for the old Yang family’s few words, even a slovenly man like Zheng Dafu wouldn’t have been allowed to help at the shop. 

The Yang family hadn’t been doing well these years, and even the Yang family’s several branches were struggling. Among the four surnames and ten clans, aside from a few that moved to the Great Li capital, those remaining behind were all thriving in the state capital, leading to jealousy and ambition among the younger generations. The old Yang family’s grandfather was growing cold-hearted, unwilling to intervene, letting these unworthy descendants fend for themselves. 

The only thing the old man relied on was that medicinal recipe in the back courtyard. 

However, only three people in the family could handle this business, three generations just right, and there were no worries about a lack of successors. 

The more descendants there were, the more the head of the family would favor those who truly had potential, while the less fortunate would be supported but not overly so. Those who could make money would only grow wealthier. 

Zheng Dafu dragged a stool to sit at the shop’s entrance, enjoying the sun without cost. Whether basking in the sun or mingling below the mountain, both were good. 

Zheng Dafu looked up at the sun, wondering if all matters could be seen clearly? 

He gazed for a long time; it had been like this since childhood. After looking long enough, it didn’t hurt the eyes anymore; it felt nothing. Later, when Zheng Dafu practiced boxing and martial arts, he stopped giving it much thought. 

Zheng Dafu withdrew his gaze, patting his knees, “Last year I hoped this year would be good; this year is still a torn cotton jacket. This year I wish for next year to be good, and next year…” 

The young man behind the counter grumbled, “You’re so annoying.” 

Zheng Dafu turned his head, laughing, “Am I dead?” 

The young man glared, “How can you talk like that?!” 

Zheng Dafu looked confused, “Do I not use my mouth? Am I supposed to use my butt?” 

The young man slammed the table, “Zheng Dafu, keep your mouth clean!” 

Zheng Dafu chuckled, raising a hand and lightly patting the table a few times, patiently saying, “Keep it down; our common folks’ tables are either for placing rice bowls or incense burners. Nothing else matters. For example, that abacus, it’s nothing serious. So don’t slam the table; it’s disrespectful to the heavens and spirits; that’s unacceptable.” 

The young man mocked, “Don’t talk nonsense here; you’re a good-for-nothing who’s spent his life guarding doors.” 

The sharpness of words could hurt more than knives. 

However, Zheng Dafu’s most frequent sparring partner was not with his master Li Er’s martial arts but rather this verbal sparring. 

There weren’t many townsfolk, but the best tongue-fighters were plentiful. 

Mud Bottle Alley, Apricot Blossom Alley, these places were rich in talent, with many outstanding figures. 

Just like that quiet Chen Ping’an during his youth, he never really made a move; in fact, this skill was being accumulated day by day. 

Zheng Dafu immediately became amused; Su Dian was too stubborn, Shi Ling Shan was too naive, but finally, a conversationalist had arrived. Feeling pleased, Zheng Dafu moved his stool closer to the threshold, smiling and saying, “Yang Shu, I heard you love going to the Iron Symbol River Water God Temple to burn incense? Do you know the real rules for burning incense? Speaking of which, this matter should be done according to the old traditions, right? Do you know why you should hold the incense in your left hand? And do you know that you’re left-handed? That’s not ideal.” 

The young man named Yang Shu felt a bit shaken, but his expression remained dismissive, too lazy to respond. 

Zheng Dafu cheerfully continued, “Fifteen loves the neighbor’s wife. At thirty, he favors someone else’s son. At fifty or sixty, he cherishes his daughter-in-law. The Yang family’s third branch has a great family tradition.” 

Yang Shu’s face flushed red, and he grabbed the abacus, smashing it towards that bastard. 

The Yang family’s third branch had indeed been poorly reputed in Fortune Street and Peach Leaf Alley; they were the type of wealthy people who “never tied their belt.” 

Zheng Dafu caught the abacus, “This is your Yang family’s money-making tool; don’t break it. If it’s damaged, who will pay for it? I’m a barefoot man; you have a little wealth. Even if you splash dirt on me, what use is that? Who do you think will end up paying? You’re about to wade into muddy waters in the state capital to earn some dirty money; I’d say it’s better not to go. The family’s prosperity relies on etiquette and righteousness, not on wealth or poverty. Study a bit, if you can’t, then have a few sons; at least there’s hope for your descendants to bring glory.” 

Yang Shu’s face turned pale with rage, trembling all over. 

Zheng Dafu shook his head, raising a hand, “Don’t get into a fight with me; I don’t hold back. One punch from me, and you’ll be practicing drunken boxing, self-taught.” 

Yang Shu turned to walk past the counter, not wanting to fight but to head home. 

Just then, the curtain lifted, and the old man said, “Yang Shu, are you really going to argue with a gatekeeper? You don’t mind losing your dignity?” 

Yang Shu snorted, but with that, he had a way out, still leaving the Yang family shop. However, he slowed his pace, walking more steadily. 

As Yang Shu brushed past the doorframe, finally walking away, the old Yang man emerged at the entrance, saying, “Is it fun to argue with a waste of space? Do you think he can understand human language?” 

Zheng Dafu had already stood up, trying to straighten his back as much as possible. 

The old man who took on disciples held respect for teachers and valued incense; this was paramount. 

Zheng Dafu followed the old man to the back courtyard. The old man lifted the curtain. Once past the threshold, he casually let it drop. Zheng Dafu gently supported him, and once he passed through, he continued to hold it, lowering it gently. 

The old Yang man sat on the steps in the main house, tapping his smoking pipe, reaching for his waist pouch. 

Soon, he began to exhale smoke. 

The fine bamboo pipe was a gift from someone, and the tobacco leaves were given by the little brat Li Huai. Over the years, the once vibrant green pipe had been rubbed and smoked into a light bamboo yellow. 

The old Yang man said, “What significance does a small lotus root blessed land hold?” 

Zheng Dafu replied, “At least it’s in the Haoran world.” 

The old Yang man glanced sideways at his disciple. 

Being too clever was never a good thing. 

Zheng Dafu helplessly said, “I’m listening to my master.” 

Well, it seemed he was truly going far now. 

The old Yang man said, “Once you get there, start anew. The road will be harder, but as long as the road isn’t difficult, there will be many people. The reason why Fan Junmao became the Lord of South Yue and not you is not without reason.” 

Zheng Dafu listened to the teachings. 

The old Yang man asked, “Why do you think it is that the Confucians opened a fifth realm at this very moment? That realm had been discovered long ago.” 

Zheng Dafu answered, “To prevent the impending war, all the schools of thought won’t help but instead pull each other down. Now that a new realm has appeared out of nowhere, those with the ability should compete for it.” 

The old Yang man further asked, “Do you know why only the Haoran world can accommodate both Daoism and Buddhism? Do you think the Qingming world and Confucian academies have a standing?” 

Zheng Dafu’s expression turned grave; he knew that this question couldn’t be answered solely through his own thoughts. 

The old man waved his hand, dispersing the smoke, asking, “Have I ever cursed the three sages as pixiu?” 

Zheng Dafu nodded. 

The old man laughed, “I just don’t know which one will slap me first.” 

Now, his master didn’t mind saying more to him. 

Yet, Zheng Dafu missed the early days when “the master spoke little, just ten characters” were such bleak times. 

Zheng Dafu suddenly froze. 

The old Yang man sneered, “Have you finally remembered? You think you’re not as smart as Li Er but still refuse to accept it.” 

Li Er had once reminded Zheng Dafu to think carefully about why his master always spoke less than ten words to him. 

Back then, Zheng Dafu could only guess that it was because his master found him bothersome and didn’t want to say more. 

Ten. 

The martial artist’s ten realms. 

Once, at the pinnacle of the Wandering Realm, he had traveled south to the old dragon city, guarding that dusty shop. Later, he met Chen Ping’an, then broke through, almost—just almost—breaking through two bottlenecks, directly reaching the Tenth Realm! 

The old Yang man coldly laughed, “If you had the ability to make me say one more word back then, you would have already reached the Tenth Realm. How could there be so many complications now? You wander east and west, asking Qi Jingchun and idly chatting with that old Yao, and what good does it do? Are you at the Tenth Realm now or still at the Eleventh Realm? Hmm, multiplied by two, and it’s almost enough.” 

Zheng Dafu was more accustomed to this kind of master. 

However, Zheng Dafu found it rare to retort, “Both Mr. Qi and Old Yao have great knowledge. My own understanding is lacking, and I can’t grasp the subtleties.” 

“Did I say you understood well?” 

The old Yang man pinched some tobacco leaves, his face full of disdain, “The most damaging thing to a house is what? Broken window paper? A rotten door? These are not big issues. Even the impoverished households of Mud Bottle Alley and Apricot Blossom Alley can afford to fix this. Just look at Chen Ping’an’s old home; the little brat can take a machete and go up and down the mountain, replacing the old with new in one trip. No matter how well you learn others’ principles, if you think you understand them thoroughly, it’s just a matter of sticking up door gods and hanging spring couplets, which will fade after a year of wind and rain.” 

Zheng Dafu said, “It’s about replacing beams and pillars, making major renovations.” 

The old Yang man nodded, “Do you think others' principles are that easy to learn? To replace the original beams and pillars means a complete renovation of the heart, which is the true meaning of self-cultivation, competing with oneself; that requires endurance.” 

The old Yang man sighed, “Let’s not even talk about the distant past. Take Qi Jingchun, who spent a century in Li Zhu Cave pondering his heart and never managed to think of a ‘reasonable’ path. Now look at Chen Ping’an; how many principles does he think he knows? Not many—just a few. How to be a person, how to understand this world through learning, how to cultivate and survive in this world, and how to get along with the world and live better. Just these three matters, just a few principles. Is it so difficult to be a good person? Simple as can be, but is it easy to put into practice? It’s hard.” 

The old Yang man could roughly guess the academic trajectory of Qi Jingchun back then. 

The Dao Ancestor once said, “Lose the Dao and then gain virtue; lose virtue and then gain benevolence; lose benevolence and then gain righteousness.” 

Qi Jingchun was probably contemplating how to solve this matter, possibly attempting to reverse it, not in order, but still in order. 

Even what Qi Jingchun was thinking could be much greater. 

Unfortunately, everything had become just a fleeting memory. 

Zheng Dafu asked, “What about the disciples?” 

The old Yang man retorted, “The master leads the disciple in, but cultivation relies on the individual. Do I need to teach disciples how to eat and relieve themselves?” 

Zheng Dafu said, “Once I reach that world, I’ll think it through properly.” 

The old Yang man raised his hand, shaking his sleeve, and a pocket-sized temple that had been refined and hidden was tossed out. The old man waved his hand, and the golden light sparkled, vanishing into Zheng Dafu’s brow. 

Zheng Dafu remained motionless. 

The old Yang man said, “Return things to their rightful owner; it's not a bother to me, as I wouldn’t even glance at it, just a headache.” 

Those golden lights were Zheng Dafu’s soul. 

Zheng Dafu stood up, cupping his fists in gratitude, “Thank you, Master, for imparting the teachings and guarding the path.” 

The old Yang man continued exhaling smoke. 

Zheng Dafu immediately sat down. 

Standing there felt disrespectful. 

Zheng Dafu turned his head, and not long after, a spirited young man in a Confucian robe entered, carrying a bamboo box and a hiking staff. 

Zheng Dafu stiffened his face. 

The dust-covered young man hurried to the old Yang man’s side, squatting down and kneading his shoulders, clicking his tongue, “Rest assured, rest assured, these muscles and bones are still strong, just like a young man. It wouldn’t be too much to marry a wife. Dafu, you’re really something; as a disciple, you don’t even consider picking out a wife for your master? Is it that hard to find a wife, or is it equally hard to find a master’s wife?” 

The old Yang man didn’t mind. 

Zheng Dafu was used to it. 

The biggest bravery in this world is probably only Li Huai daring to treat the old man this way. 

The old Yang man asked, “Are you going to the Piyun Mountain Forest to study at the Deer Academy again?” 

Li Huai straightforwardly sat down on the ground, “That’s secondary; I want to duel with Pei Qian, but it’ll be a battle of wits. After a few years, we’ve both accumulated a lot, and now we’ve scheduled a showdown at the plaza outside the Master’s Hall on Zise Peak, a grand event of top experts clashing in the martial world. She went to the Sword Qi Great Wall, and we met at the academy; she said she was going to prepare her treasures for a rematch.” 

Li Huai lamented, “It’s a pity that Li Baoping has gone off on her own adventures; if I lose to Pei Qian, that’s fine. But if I accidentally win, without Li Baoping to back me up, I fear I won’t be able to leave Fallen Mountain.” 

Zheng Dafu laughed, “You still have people you’re afraid of?” 

Li Huai nodded, “Of course, I’m afraid of Qi Jingchun, afraid of Baoping, afraid of Pei Qian; there are so many teachers at the academy that I’m afraid of.” 

Zheng Dafu jested, “What about Chen Ping’an, is he someone you fear?” 

Li Huai thought seriously, “If he’s around, I’m not afraid.” 

On Fortune Street, there were scholars like Li Xisheng, who was traveling to Daisui Mountain, and Li Baoping, who was studying at the Great Sui Cliff Academy, along with Zhao Yao, who went to Central Divine Continent. 

In Peach Leaf Alley, there was Xie Ling, the direct disciple of Dragon Spring Sword Sect, and Wei’s servant girl Tao Ya, who was headed to the Great Li capital, as well as Lin Shouyi, who was focused on both cultivation and studies. 

In Mud Bottle Alley, there was Chen Ping’an, who went to the Sword Qi Great Wall, and Gu Can, who had stirred up waves at Book and Letter Lake, now began to hibernate again. 

There was Song Jixin, who became a prince of the Great Li, and the maid Zhi Gui. 

In Apricot Blossom Alley, there was a young genius leader of the continent, Ma Kuxuan. 

The siblings Li Liu and Li Huai. 

The businessman Dong Shuijing. 

At the Yang family shop, there were also Su Dian and Shi Ling Shan. 

The town’s luckiest often had heavy roots, like Li Huai and Gu Can. Back in the day, the old locust tree had the most leaves, actually belonging to Gu Can, who had secretly stuffed a large pocket. When he returned to Mud Bottle Alley, Chen Ping’an reminded him, and only then did he realize how many locust leaves he had. 

The strongest fate probably still belonged to Chen Ping’an. 

But all of this, the children and youths of Li Zhu Cave’s streets and alleys, had unknowingly passed nearly fifteen years. 

Everyone had their own circumstances, opportunities, and achievements, not all of which were smooth sailing. 

Unknowingly, fifteen years had passed, and many children in the town had already reached the age of adulthood, while the group of young men from back then were now nearing thirty and standing firm. 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 767: Standing Beneath the Bright Moon

A tall young man and a strikingly beautiful woman entered the Dragon Prefecture of the Great Li Dynasty, a land that had become a feng shui treasure after the destruction of the Li Pearl Cave and its subsequent roots in the earth. 

This place was filled with numerous mountains and rivers, brimming with stories, and it was one of the finest cultivation grounds in the Baoping Continent. Yet, everything about the mountains and rivers felt shrouded in a mist that made it hard to see clearly.

As the two made their way along the Iron Talismans River towards Huaihuang County, they passed a bustling temple dedicated to the Water Goddess. Due to their identities and cultivation backgrounds, neither dared to enter and burn incense. When they finally caught sight of the eastern city gate, the young man sighed in relief and remarked, “We’ve finally arrived. Miss Ma, should we visit Mr. Chen at the mountain first, or should we pay a visit to Gu Can’s home in the state city? It might be harder to find Luopo Mountain, while the state city is relatively easier to navigate.”

This pair had not had an easy journey northward through Longzhou. The main reason was that Gu Can had suddenly instructed them to go north alone, while he and the peculiar scholar named Liu Chicheng were headed to Qingfeng City to visit the Xu family. This left the timid Zeng Ye feeling quite anxious. Years ago, he had been pulled from the fiery pit of Maoyue Island by the steward Zhang Ye and brought to the small hut at the mountain gate, where he met that accountant. His life had since undergone a tremendous transformation. Afterward, he met Gu Can, transitioning from fear to familiarity, and now to dependence—all in the span of just a few years. For someone who preferred quiet meditation, it felt like a mere moment.

At some point, Zeng Ye, who used to have nightmares just from a casual glance from Gu Can, now found himself feeling uneasy without Gu Can by his side, as if he were walking on unstable ground while exploring mountains and rivers. 

In fact, Zeng Ye, who was naturally suited for ghostly path cultivation, had made rapid progress over the years. He could even be considered exceptionally quick, though he had remained inconspicuous due to Gu Can’s presence. 

Zeng Ye was now a legitimate Qi Condensation cultivator, someone who could be regarded as a “mid-tier immortal lord” in the martial world of ordinary vassal states. 

Because he practiced esoteric techniques that leaned heavily towards the yin, Zeng Ye was able to approach various mountain temples and immortal peaks while Gu Can was with him. However, once they parted ways, he lacked the confidence to do so, especially with Ma Duyi by his side, who exuded an ethereal presence. She relied on a talisman made from fox fur to walk among mortals, and to those profound cultivators on the mountains, both Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi could easily be seen as unclean and heretical beings.

Ma Duyi had a jade token hanging at her waist, a peace talisman left for them by Gu Can. After some thought, she smiled and said, “Let’s head to Luopo Mountain first. We’re quite familiar with Mr. Chen, so we shouldn’t be turned away. Even if Mr. Chen isn’t there, it shouldn’t be too hard to find someone to share a cup of tea with, right?”

Zeng Ye grinned and replied, “Sure, I was thinking the same.” 

There are always some people whose thoughts bring a sense of reassurance.

After passing through Huaihuang County and asking locals for directions, they faced a language barrier and struggled to communicate. After much effort, they finally found a shopkeeper who spoke the Great Li dialect, but even he couldn’t provide a clear address for Luopo Mountain. He only offered vague directions, saying to head past the small town until they reached the Pearl Mountain, a small hill, and then look for an opportunity to ask the mountain’s immortals for guidance.

Once they entered the spirit-filled continuous mountains, it took them quite some time to find the grayish mountain that was part of Luopo Mountain’s domain. After heading south, they arrived at the foot of the sheer cliffs on the southern side of Luopo Mountain, not far from the main gate to the south. However, Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi were met with an unfathomable scene. 

First, they saw a little girl dressed in black, facing away from them, gazing up at the clouds hanging like a white belt high on the cliffs. The girl carried a golden small yoke on one shoulder and a green bamboo walking stick on the other, shouting loudly, “Pei Qian, Pei Qian, don’t jump wrong this time! It’s such a hassle to fill the pit!”

Zeng Ye glanced around the little girl, noticing the ground was pockmarked with pits. 

That green bamboo walking stick looked very familiar!

Suddenly, the black-clad girl turned around, her eyes locking onto the two outsiders, and she dashed away in an instant.

Zeng Ye quickly looked up.

A dark spot broke through the clouds, accompanied by a whistling sound as it plummeted down. In an instant, a slender figure landed heavily on the ground, causing a massive thud that shook the earth and sent dust flying.

Zeng Ye focused, staring into the distance.

In the huge pit, a slightly dark-skinned, slender girl crouched down slightly, slowly rising to her feet. She turned to the little girl, who was huddled at the edge of the pit, and reproached, “Little Rice Grain, what’s going on? If it weren’t for my keen eyes, you would have fallen into the pit if you had taken a different route. What would happen if you got hurt? Didn’t I tell you to stay put…”

As she spoke, the astonishingly agile girl casually took a few steps and positioned herself between the little girl and the two outsiders.

Ma Duyi noticed that the girl was wearing a pair of crudely woven straw sandals, with blood trickling from her feet.

Unable to help herself, Ma Duyi glanced at the cliff before looking back at the girl.

Was she attempting to commit suicide by jumping off the cliff, or was this just a game?

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi were not purely martial artists, so they didn’t understand the intricacies of that girl’s cliff-jumping “ground slam.”

She was using her body to test the ground.

She had to condense all the divine intent of protection into pure physicality, utilizing the momentum from her fall, as if delivering the heaviest punch from the heavens to the earth.

In the girl’s words, it was about delivering a heavy blow to the ground!

This method of training was something the girl came up with herself. Warm Tree, of course, disagreed, thinking it was too dangerous. Pei Qian was still at the fifth realm bottleneck, and her body wasn’t resilient enough. Little Rice Grain believed it was feasible, and since it was two against one, they could try. Warm Tree wanted to consult the old chef, but by the time Pei Qian stepped onto the six stone slabs laid out on the bamboo building, she leaped and disappeared from sight.

Zhou Mili was crouched at the edge of the cliff, and Warm Tree was getting anxious. The old chef had already appeared at the cliff’s edge, glancing at the ground, tsk-tsking.

Warm Tree breathed a sigh of relief, seeing it wasn’t a big deal.

Soon after, Pei Qian climbed up the cliff, limping a bit but with her eyes sparkling as she laughed, “That felt great!”

Zhu Lian said nothing and turned to leave.

And so, more pits appeared on the ground.

Zhou Mili made a playful gesture at Pei Qian, scolding her for making Warm Tree angry.

This was the scene that Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi witnessed today.

If this was how Luopo Mountain entertained guests, it was certainly a unique approach.

Pei Qian glanced at the two unfamiliar visitors and asked, “Was the sound of the abacus on the left or the right?”

Zeng Ye was baffled.

Ma Duyi replied, “Facing the mountain gate, it’s the left side’s accountant.”

Only then did Pei Qian smile and clasp her fists, saying, “I am Pei Qian, the first disciple of Luopo Mountain, pleased to meet you, Daoist Zeng and Sister Ma!”

Ma Duyi was somewhat astonished—what a clever girl! Her insight was exceptional! It was known that Gu Can had privately stated that Liu Chicheng had cast an illusion to help conceal their yin presence, but Gu Can had also said that this matter should not be revealed to Zeng Ye. While traveling, Zeng Ye should be careful where he stepped. Ma Duyi had laughed and scolded in jest, “Are you worried I might accidentally stir up trouble?” Gu Can had only smiled and remained silent, handing her the invaluable peace talisman.

Only then did Ma Duyi refrain from confronting Gu Can. Ultimately, it was Gu Can who was more cautious and worldly. Sometimes, when she and Zeng Ye interacted without Gu Can nearby, she couldn’t help but feel that Gu Can learned too quickly, regardless of what it was. In matters of cultivation, there was no need to elaborate; with various local dialects and the heroes of the martial world they encountered, as well as the officials and common folk they mingled with, Gu Can always seemed to fit in perfectly, creating a significant distance between Ma Duyi and Zeng Ye.

At this point, Zhou Mili stood next to Pei Qian, tilting her head and frowning, then pretending to understand everything, nodding lightly as if she were well-versed in the ways of the martial world.

Since they were guests, it was inappropriate to return home via the cliff path. Pei Qian led the two visitors around to the mountain gate.

Of course, she didn’t forget to introduce the right protector of Luopo Mountain, Little Rice Grain.

Zhou Mili quietly reminded, “She is the right protector of Luopo Mountain, formerly the right protector of Qilong Alley, but now given to Xian…”

Pei Qian coughed lightly.

Zhou Mili immediately shut her mouth, standing on her toes with her palm covering her mouth, “Let’s not keep track of anything; I haven’t let anything slip yet.”

Pei Qian rubbed her little head, saying nothing. What was there to keep track of? Little Rice Grain and Warm Tree only had a record of their contributions; there wasn’t any small ledger at all. However, such matters couldn’t be spoken of; otherwise, Little Rice Grain would easily become proud.

Ma Duyi’s expression remained unchanged, though she was stunned for a moment. Zeng Ye, on the other hand, was relatively calm, as Mr. Chen had always approached worldly affairs with a tranquil heart, as long as there was no conflict with the principles.

Upon reaching the mountain gate, Zheng Dafeng was already absent.

Now, the young Yuan Lai was temporarily stationed there, responsible for guarding the gate.

Cen Yuanji happened to be practicing her fists, coming down from the mountain peak. She was now a fourth realm martial artist, though she had struggled a bit to break through the third realm bottleneck. The old chef said she was doing quite well, but Cen Yuanji was not entirely satisfied. Despite having a good relationship with her peer Yuan Bao, both of them were pure martial artists, and there would inevitably be competition.

Women often behaved like this; even in the best of relationships, there would be small competitions hidden within their charming gazes and smiles. Such emotions were merely human nature—more subtle and captivating than the blatant struggles of men.

Moreover, Yuan Bao’s teacher was Lu Baixiang, while Cen Yuanji had always regarded Old Master Zhu as her mentor. Since Old Master Zhu and Lu Baixiang had similar standings at Luopo Mountain, neither of them competed openly. However, as their disciples, she and Yuan Bao would still engage in a bit of rivalry.

The young man in the green shirt, Yuan Lai, was sitting under the wall, reading, taking advantage of his sister's absence. When Cen Yuanji arrived at the foot of the mountain after her six-step training, she lost interest in her book and turned her attention to the young lady.

Uncle Zheng had left many books for Yuan Lai in the study before his long journey and had told him earnestly that when he grew older, he could visit the old chef’s private library, where the knowledge would be vast. The young man was somewhat fascinated.

Seeing Pei Qian and the others, the boy had no choice but to pull his attention away from Cen Yuanji’s beautiful eyes and quickly walked toward the mountain gate. After hearing Pei Qian’s introduction, he bowed to the two visitors who were old friends of the young mountain lord. He suddenly realized that this was a scholar’s etiquette, and if his sister found out, he would be scolded, so Yuan Lai hastily cupped his fists and smiled.

After Cen Yuanji greeted them, she continued to practice her fists up the mountain.

Old Master Zhu had previously advised that as long as the path beneath one’s feet was correct, diligence would compensate for shortcomings. Practicing martial arts shouldn’t become a rigid endeavor; if one wishes to embody the intent of their techniques, they must find a source of vitality within their martial arts. This was the so-called martial artist’s practice of climbing high while establishing a purpose in their heart first. In the end, Old Master Zhu encouraged Cen Yuanji to contemplate what she truly sought from her martial arts practice; once she understood, training would no longer be a burden.

Upon reaching the mountain, Pei Qian discovered that the old chef was not at home.

Fortunately, with Chen Nuanshu around, there was no worry about neglecting the two guests.

As long as one was a guest of Luopo Mountain, there was no distinction between high and low status.

Zhu Lian had gone to the Sword Offering Platform.

Sword cultivators Cui Wei and the young Zhang Jiazhen were currently residing there.

Wei Ban stood at the foot of the mountain, slowly ascending with Zhu Lian, whom he called over.

Wei Ban laughed, “Fortunately, the current manager of the Longquan Sword Sect isn’t Master Ruan, but Miss Xiu Xiu. Otherwise, even I might not be able to cover everything.”

Zhu Lian’s expression was not relaxed, “Is that woman’s identity confirmed?”

Wei Ban nodded, “She is indeed the ferrywoman we were instructed to look for by Chen Ping’an, the ferrywoman of the Jiao Mountain ferry, Chunshui.”

Years ago, after the ferry across the continent sank in the territory of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, she miraculously survived and took on the alias Shi Qiao. On a small mountain peak of the immortals, she revealed the collusion between the Heavenly Monarch Xie Shi and the Song family of the Great Li Dynasty, framing the Zhu Ying Dynasty.

Regarding this matter, the Great Li Emperor’s imperial study had discussed it carefully. If it weren’t for the national teacher Cui Shao’s belief that the leak of such information would lead to a so-called exposure, or if Cui Shao was hoping to lure a big fish to bite the bait, otherwise, even if that ferry maid were secretly taken away, with the current intelligence network of the Great Li, a fifth realm female cultivator would find it hard to escape death even with a powerful rescue.

Zhu Lian said, “This situation is quite troublesome.”

Wei Ban laughed, “Of course, if it weren’t troublesome, would I have called you over? Such matters, seemingly big or small, ultimately tread on forbidden ground.”

Zhu Lian said, “It’s not too troublesome; I need to confirm one thing.”

Wei Ban nodded, “As long as you have a clear mind, that’s enough. I, on the other hand, have a notorious reputation, so I’m not worried about this matter.”

Zhu Lian shook his head, “It’s not that simple. Alright, I know the way; I’ll go myself. You return to Piyun Mountain and act as if you know nothing.”

Wei Ban frowned.

Zhu Lian said, “If you want to maintain good relationships, then don’t ruin them. Brother Wei, friends are friends, but matters are matters. Since we’re friends, some things shouldn’t involve you.”

Wei Ban laughed, “Then I’ll keep an eye on the Sword Offering Platform and, if anything stirs up, we can discuss a plan then.”

Zhu Lian nodded.

Being kind to friends should be met with kindness in return.

This is the code of the martial world.

Earlier, it was Wei Ban who had “detained” that group of people from the edge of the North Mountain Territory to the Sword Offering Platform, and he dissipated into thin air.

Zhu Lian soon saw a weary group arriving.

The Golden Pill bottleneck sword cultivator Cui Wei was confused, merely watching the inexplicably appearing people on the mountain.

A young man with the surname Dugu, a maid named Meng Long, and a woman named Shi Qiao.

After Zhu Lian arrived, he nodded to Cui Wei, who then took off on his sword.

Zhu Lian turned toward the woman with the real name Chunshui, asking, “Miss Chunshui, I have two questions that I’d like you to answer honestly.”

Meng Long, the maid, looked somewhat displeased.

The pale-skinned young man, however, remained composed.

Chunshui nodded.

Zhu Lian’s expression softened as he smiled, “First, did you come to find my young master on your own accord? Second, when did you have this thought? Was it after the ferry sank that you sought to find the only person you could trust in a foreign land, or was it that you were left with no other choice now?”

Chunshui’s eyes were clear as she replied, “I never thought about finding Chen Ping’an before. The reason I changed my mind now is that I don’t want to put Young Master Dugu in danger. I only hope that Young Master Dugu can survive, and I can be handed over to the Great Li Dynasty.”

Chunshui paused slightly and added with sincerity, “It may seem childish, but it’s the truth.”

Zhu Lian nodded, smiling, “I trust Miss Chunshui.”

Then, the stooped old man turned and smiled, “The exiled nobles of the Zhu Ying Dynasty, am I right?”

Young Master Dugu nodded, “Indeed. I wouldn’t dare deceive you, senior. My real name is Dugu Duanshun, but now I go by Shao Po Xian. As a person of a fallen nation, I truly don’t wish to die just yet; that’s why I resorted to this.”

Zhu Lian asked, “Do you believe that by coming to this unknown Luopo Mountain, you can survive, or is it a desperate gamble?”

Young Master Dugu replied, “The latter.”

The three of them had faced two ambushes during their flight; one was an unexpected encounter, while the other was a well-prepared attack from the Great Li’s accompanying cultivators.

Zhu Lian laughed, “What kindness do you owe to Miss Chunshui? Tell me, I’m just an errand boy here at Luopo Mountain, not very learned. I truly want to inquire from you, Young Master Dugu.”

Dugu Duanshun was momentarily speechless.

His reasons for saving “Shi Qiao” were certainly not noble; they were far from any chivalrous act.

Meng Long’s expression was pained.

How did her master end up in such dire straits?

After a moment of silence, Zhu Lian asked, “Where did the last ambush occur?”

Dugu Duanshun replied, “Around Nanjian Country, far from the Great Li’s Dragon Prefecture. The reason for the ambush was that among the Great Li’s accompanying cultivators, someone possessed the Zhu Ying Dynasty’s imperial jade seal, allowing them to trace me. After the ambush, I pretended to head south, and midway, I broke the dragon vein in my personal small world before quietly heading north. I believe I wasn’t being monitored by the Great Li.”

The young man’s words were succinct.

As for the dangers and costs involved, those were not for outsiders to know.

Zhu Lian asked, “Shao Po Xian, do you wish to linger in a small area or to generously risk your life for your country?”

Dugu Duanshun chuckled, “That question is unnecessary, old senior.”

Zhu Lian nodded, looking at the downcast young woman, he smiled and said, “Miss Chunshui, do you know that what you’re doing will bring major problems to my young master?”

Chunshui was about to speak when Zhu Lian interrupted, laughing, “What do you think? I have a good memory; once I hear something, I remember it, so I’m merely stating a fact now.”

Chunshui nodded, biting her lip until it bled.

She hid one hand in her sleeve, tightly clutching something, her arm trembling slightly.

Aside from repaying the life-saving grace to Young Master Dugu, she had her own selfish motives.

She hoped to deliver something to Luopo Mountain. After that, even if Luopo Mountain used her to negotiate with the Great Li’s Song family, she wouldn’t mind.

Zhu Lian chuckled, looking around.

The Sword Offering Platform was filled with wild persimmon trees. In winter, the bright red persimmons hung from the high branches, delightful to behold.

In her hometown in the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, persimmons had a nickname, quite elegant—the Frost-Resisting Marquis.

Finally, Zhu Lian said to the dazed young woman, “If my young master were here, he would be very pleased to reunite with Miss Chunshui after a long separation.”

After saying this, Zhu Lian left the Sword Offering Platform.

Meng Long quietly asked, “Young Master, what does this mean?”

Dugu Duanshun laughed heartily, “To live under someone’s roof and have a meal is not a bad thing.”

After Zhu Lian stepped down from the Sword Offering Platform, Wei Ban appeared.

Zhu Lian said, exasperated, “Are you a mountain lord who courts trouble?”

Wei Ban laughed, “I’m just bored.”

Zhu Lian, with his hands behind his back, slowly said, “That ‘Shi Qiao’ girl is definitely someone we need to save. As for the other two, we merely need to clarify one thing.”

Wei Ban asked, “That is, who told him that coming to this unremarkable Luopo Mountain would guarantee survival?”

Zhu Lian exclaimed in shock, “Brother Wei, you have a keen insight!”

Wei Ban responded with a polite smile.

Zhu Lian scratched his head, chuckling, “Well, I can find something serious to do. I can’t just be the cook who’s always blamed for the saltiness or blandness of the dishes. It’s about time for us at Luopo Mountain to actively resolve some troubles. Otherwise, unnecessary troubles will only grow.”

Zhu Lian scoffed, “Picking soft persimmons to squeeze?”

Wei Ban chuckled knowingly.

It seemed that the matter regarding the Water Goddess of the Yuyue River had not yet settled.

Wei Ban gazed toward Luopo Mountain and said, “Coincidentally, another guest has arrived.”

The two vanished into thin air, appearing atop Luopo Mountain.

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi then saw the handsome immortal figure.

As for the kind-looking old gentleman beside him, he was indeed overshadowed by the strikingly handsome young man with golden earrings.

Chen Nuanshu quickly got up to introduce Zhu Lian and Wei Ban, the head steward of Luopo Mountain and the North Mountain Lord of the Great Li, respectively.

Zeng Ye and Ma Duyi were nearly scared out of their wits.

Currently, among the Five Great Mountain Lords of a continent, Wei Ban ranked the highest in cultivation and also had the greatest reputation!

Pei Qian reminded, “Old chef, it’s almost mealtime; make sure to showcase your best skills.”

Little Rice Grain wiped her mouth, “Can we not?”

Zhu Lian gently called out, “Alright then,” and immediately went off to the kitchen in the back courtyard.

It seemed that the small kitchen was Zhu Lian’s little world.

Wei Ban felt helpless inside.

More reliant on his looks than Jiang Shangzhen, yet he insisted on being a cook.

At the Qilong Alley’s New Year’s shop, old friends were also reuniting.

Dong Shuijing, Lin Shouyi.

And there was that girl who had once worried about the nickname “Little Stone” spreading, who had moved to the Great Li capital with her family and had now married.

Shi Jia Chun.

Li Baoping’s closest friend once upon a time.

The New Year’s shop and the neighboring Grass Head shop had once been the family business of Shi Jia Chun.

Also, Shi Jia Chun and Shi Ling Shan from Taoye Alley were somewhat related, though Shi Jia Chun was of a higher generation. If they were to meet, she would have to call her aunt.

Life is unpredictable; the former classmates and friends had scattered after parting ways in the small town over a decade ago, and now they were all in radically different situations.

Shi Jia Chun was now happily raising her family. Her husband was from a prominent family, named Bian Wenmao, whose family had been settled in the Great Li capital for hundreds of years. Their ancestors were from the Lu Dynasty’s aristocracy, and perhaps due to their long lineage, combined with the saying that “trees move and people thrive,” the family in the Great Li had a respectable status. While their family’s officials were not particularly renowned, most of them held honorable positions, being well-known scholars from the early days of the Great Li’s literary scene.

Moreover, the family of the mountain deity, who was nominally worshiped, was not shabby either. One was an elder of the Changchun Palace’s ancestral hall, while the other had an unfortunate fate. Years ago, with a few long-residing friends in the mountains, he had a conflict with the sage Ruan Qiong while passing through the jurisdiction of the Li Pearl Cave. The outcome wasn’t good, but at least he survived, which was fortunate compared to another friend who died and vanished entirely.

This reunion was initiated when Dong Shuijing went to the Great Li capital for business and sought out Shi Jia Chun. She wanted to set a time for their old classmates to gather back in their hometown of Huaihuang Town.

But since Li Baoping happened to be traveling south, she missed it.

So Shi Jia Chun was now complaining about Baoping.

The group sat in the back courtyard of the shop reminiscing, while the shopkeeper, Shi Rou, brought over tea and snacks and then left quickly.

Listening to Shi Jia Chun’s chatter, Dong Shuijing laughed, “Baoping really doesn’t value your face at all; it’s quite unreasonable.”

Lin Shouyi nodded, “I’ll have Li Huai mention it to her later.”

Shi Jia Chun rolled her eyes, “Li Huai? Forget it, he has the audacity to speak grandly in front of Baoping!”

Suddenly realizing that her husband was sitting next to her, Shi Jia Chun quickly straightened her posture and composed her expression.

Bian Wenmao was a charming seed of a scholar with a well-chosen name, and now he was working in the Hanlin Academy, editing history books. Among the local officials of the Great Li, he was considered a refreshing figure. He wasn’t particularly outstanding, but at a young age, he had firmly established himself in the literary scene of the Great Li capital, working in the Hanlin Academy, which was often regarded as the “land of future ministers.” Once he gets promoted, his official rank wouldn’t be small.

In other places, Bian Wenmao would have been a top guest in any government office, but in Huaihuang County, where the two prominent families, the Cao and Yuan, had disputes, he found himself in a bit of a dilemma. 

Bian Wenmao’s impression of these two young men was one was very ordinary, while the other was somewhat decent.

The ordinary one was Dong Shuijing, who came from a merchant background.

The somewhat decent one was Lin Shouyi, who had studied at the Cliff Academy in Great Sui.

As for their family backgrounds, Shi Jia Chun had mentioned them in passing; they were just casual words. Dong Shuijing's family wasn’t very wealthy, but he had established himself early on. As for settling down, there were some uncertainties.

Lin Shouyi’s father had served under three different supervisors of the Dragon Kiln, and it was said he was also working in the Great Li capital now, but he had no connections with the Shi family, and Bian Wenmao didn’t feel it was worth pursuing a relationship with Lin Shouyi, who was an outsider. However, Lin Shouyi being able to study at the Cliff Academy and eventually entering the Great Li officialdom should mean he wouldn’t fare too poorly.

Li Huai rushed into the back courtyard, “Hey, it’s been so many years since we’ve seen each other, and you’re already talking bad about me?”

Shi Jia Chun turned her head, stunned for a moment. The once small and round Li Huai had suddenly grown into a tall young man.

Lin Shouyi and Dong Shuijing hadn’t changed much; they were still the same as before. But Li Huai? He was completely different from the impression he left in their childhood.

For instance, when he threw his shorts up a tree, Li Huai would roll on the ground crying just to call for Mr. Qi.

Shi Jia Chun stood up and teased, “Li Huai? Have you been eating well these years?”

Bian Wenmao slowly stood up, smiling but saying nothing.

Li Huai was a classmate with whom Shi Jia Chun had shared many stories, thus he was someone Bian Wenmao found least interesting. He could tell that this person was a dullard who hadn’t opened his mind in school; he had only gotten into the Cliff Academy due to his ancestors' merit. People like him would inevitably fall back to the ground sooner or later. Dong Shuijing, on the other hand, had some skills and was rumored to have connected with both Cao and Yuan.

Li Huai greeted Bian Wenmao and could see that he was not particularly fond of him. The atmosphere was polite yet distant. He couldn’t let his good friend Shi Jia Chun down, so he forced a smile.

Then he plopped down in front of Shi Jia Chun, grabbing a piece of pastry, mumbling, “Before Baoping leaves, she said she would stop by the capital to see you.”

Shi Jia Chun laughed, “At least she has some conscience.”

Lin Shouyi and Dong Shuijing sat across from each other. They had always had a good relationship but were somewhat at odds, which made Shi Jia Chun find it amusing. The reasoning was simple: they both liked Li Huai’s sister.

Shi Jia Chun didn’t believe that Lin Shouyi’s better background would guarantee that Li Liu would like him.

Shi Jia Chun had always felt that Li Liu, who often went to the school to pick up her brother, was a bit odd, though she couldn’t pinpoint why. Logically, Li Liu was older and had already been a young lady, appearing gentle and delicate, unlike the more spirited Zhi Gui from Ni Ping Alley. Both were beauties, but Shi Jia Chun felt that if they were to get along, the unsmiling maid Zhi Gui might be easier to approach than Li Liu.

Bian Wenmao had another social engagement in the state city, but as his wife rarely returned to the capital, he remained patient, not revealing any emotion.

After spending about half an hour at the New Year’s shop, Shi Jia Chun stood up to leave, heading to the state city where a carriage from her husband’s friend awaited.

Li Huai and the others followed her to the shop’s entrance just as Yu Lu and Xie Xie were coming down from the Lin Deer Academy, planning to go to Luopo Mountain together.

Earlier, Li Huai had gone once, returning to Piyun Mountain Academy, repeatedly lamenting his loss.

Bian Wenmao didn’t mind too much, politely bidding farewell to everyone as he helped his wife into the carriage, bowing one last time.

After watching the carriage depart, everyone returned to the back courtyard to continue their chat. Li Huai crossed his arms behind his head, “That Bian Wenmao thinks too highly of himself.”

Lin Shouyi calmly replied, “Shi Jia Chun is looking for a husband. As long as Bian Wenmao truly likes her, that’s enough. Shi Jia Chun isn’t looking for a friend for us.”

Dong Shuijing nodded.

Li Huai pouted, “I just think Shi Jia Chun could find someone better.”

Lin Shouyi shook his head, “There’s no reason to argue.”

Suddenly, Li Huai became anxious, “Is Baoping really safe traveling the martial world alone? She’s not a cultivator!”

Lin Shouyi thought for a moment but refrained from revealing the truth.

Yu Lu and Xie Xie shared the same sentiment.

The only one who was oblivious to the situation was Li Huai, who believed that his luck depended on whether he stepped on a dog’s poop.

Before heading to Luopo Mountain, Lin Shouyi asked Li Huai and the others to wait a moment. He went to the ancestral home, cleaning the courtyard and the ancestral hall. The young scholar recited the family teachings in silence.

Finally, he lit three incense sticks, mumbling, “Thank you, ancestors.”

Li Huai was impatient, saying he would head to Pearl Mountain to wait.

Not far from his ancestral home, Pei Qian and Zhou Mili were already waiting there.

Pei Qian remarked, “A general who has lost his army!”

Li Huai quickly retorted, “Even in defeat, there is honor; I dare not speak of bravery!”

Pei Qian nodded and led the way.

Pei Qian asked, “What about our two subordinates from the branch?”

Li Huai felt guilty, “Those two wrote the wrong articles and got scolded by the teacher, so they’re currently gnawing on their pens.”

Pei Qian shook her head, then pointed at Little Rice Grain beside her, “Zhou Mili will be the deputy leader of our branch from now on.”

Zhou Mili was stunned on the spot, her joy overwhelming! She now had a proper title!

Li Huai was thrilled.

Originally, the branch only had three people, and now it finally seemed a bit more substantial.

Afterwards, the group made their way to Luopo Mountain.

Upon reaching the mountain, Yu Lu stopped at the gate, saying he would ascend later to chat with the boy Yuan Lai, who was flipping through books.

Xie Xie also wandered off, meeting Cen Yuanji, who was practicing her punches on the mountain top, along with the standing Yuan Bao.

Xie Xie appeared somewhat dazed.

It was as if she saw her carefree self from years ago, practicing cultivation on the mountain.

After that, Pei Qian, after exchanging nods with the old chef and Wei Ban, took Little Rice Grain to the Lotus Flower Blessed Land, following the paths they had previously walked, hiking through mountains and rivers, reaching the capital of the Nanyuan Kingdom.

Passing through the Scholar’s Lane, they went to a temple to burn incense, and then sat in the corridor in a daze.

Zhou Mili merely accompanied Pei Qian; when Pei Qian was happy, she would say more, and when Pei Qian was not happy, she would stay silent.

Finally, Pei Qian chose a private residence, one she had secretly purchased with her own money, which the old chef also knew about but chose to turn a blind eye to.

It was the tranquil dwelling where the great demon Ding Ying had once stayed with Ya Er and the flower boy from Chunqiao Palace, Zhou Shi.

Pei Qian sat cross-legged there, mimicking her master’s actions, rolling up her sleeves, and began to meditate, nurturing her martial intent.

The reason she came here was to break through the martial path’s barriers.

Pei Qian intended to seize back whatever martial fortune belonged to her from the Lotus Flower Blessed Land through her own efforts.

Moreover, when the time comes, Wei Ban would open the gates of the blessed land, and Pei Qian would scatter all the martial fortune she had won from the Haoran World, just as her master had done, feeding it back to the Lotus Flower Blessed Land.

Old Master Cui may be gone, but there was no way to return home.

So she would take back the martial fortune that Old Master Cui had left behind here to Luopo Mountain.

In the central region of the Baoping Continent, a great ancient river leading to the sea was under construction, involving dozens of rivers and numerous mountains with mountain god temples and earth deity shrines.

Such an ambitious project, even the exiled elders couldn’t help but sigh. The Great Li rabble truly dared to envision what others wouldn’t dare to, and do what others couldn’t.

The Great Li court was exhausting the people and wasting resources, while the young emperor was so eager for achievements and grandiosity. Didn’t he fear that he might rise high today and fall into oblivion tomorrow? In the end, wouldn’t it be the common people who would suffer?

However, it was said that the Guanhul Academy’s highly reputed new Zhongyue and the historic Jiang Clan of Yunlin were both participating in the project, which only stirred more emotions.

Was it possible that the entire Baoping Continent would truly fall under the Song clan’s rule, becoming a land governed by a single family?

The Great Li court dispatched three officials from localities to oversee the construction of the great river: Guan Yiran, the direct descendant of the Guan family, Liu Xunmei from the capital’s Chi’er Street, and the civil servant Liu Qingfeng from the Qingsuan Kingdom.

Aside from the last one, who was unfamiliar, the Great Li capital’s officials were not strangers to Guan Yiran and Liu Xunmei. Both hailed from noble families and were young talents among their peers. Especially Guan Yiran, who had early on immersed himself in the borderlands, growing up among the dead as a military cultivator. Liu Xunmei was not bad either, having fought his way south.

Guan’s family had long held the position of a stable and esteemed minister in the Great Li’s Ministry of Personnel. The flowing positions of deputy ministers and officials were often just jokes, as it was said that once there were two governors from the Ministry of Personnel who met by chance, both were former deputy ministers from the Ministry.

As for Liu Qingfeng, he was largely unknown in the Great Li court. In fact, even the highly regarded old master of the Guan family in the Ministry of Personnel had little familiarity with Liu Qingfeng, having to sift through records. 

The evaluation of the Qingsuan Kingdom’s reopening of shipping routes was average; they only managed to achieve a fair rating. Merely having some minor contributions, he had been appointed as a local governor and unexpectedly needed to travel north, engaging with numerous mountain deities and immortal beings. His rank jumped from fourth to third, as the Great Li court appointed him as a temporary river supervisor.

Guan Yiran and Liu Xunmei’s ranks remained unchanged, making it seem as if they had become subordinates of a vassal state’s official.

However, Liu Qingfeng was not the first to be suddenly promoted from a vassal official to a prominent figure in the Great Li court. The former vassal Huang Tingguo had a county magistrate named Wei Li, who was also promoted several ranks to become the current governor of Longzhou. Among the mountain spirits, some land deity from the Red Candle Town territory became a city deity.

The Grand General of the Qingsuan Kingdom, Wei Liang, was rumored to have signs of a promotion as well, with whispers from the Great Li’s Ministry of Personnel.

The southeastern Qingsuan Kingdom of the Baoping Continent had inexplicably transformed from an isolated area into a favorable location for officials.

Officials were clearly divided into pure and corrupt streams. The most significant distinction among the people of the Baoping Continent now was whether they originated from the Great Li itself.

However, compared to Wei Ban’s swift rise to the position of mountain god of Piyun Mountain, and then to the North Mountain Lord of an entire continent, these changes in the officialdom were not particularly surprising.

The Great Li cavalry had been waging war to the south for many years, with many young faces rising among the military generals, including those from humble origins.

Yet, the rapid loss and promotion of the Great Li border troops had become commonplace, and the people had long grown accustomed to it. The civil officials and the mountain spirit’s genealogical system operated with strict discipline, which made sudden appearances of new figures quite eye-catching.

Today marked the first gathering of the three main officials overseeing the river construction. There were no welcome banquets; they simply convened by a large river.

Liu Qingfeng was accompanied by Wang Yifu.

Guan Yiran was perplexed, as the descendant of the upper minister, according to his great-grandfather, he was supposed to be responsible for a north-south ferry route, even arranging friends to accompany him. Yet, he found himself here, naturally receiving a scolding.

Liu Xunmei, flanked by two guards, Cao Jun and Wei Xian.

Wei Xian had followed the sword genius Cao Jun from the Ni Ping Alley, and alongside Liu Xunmei, who seemed nothing like a noble scion, he was doing well for himself.

Wei Xian, with the identity of a military cultivator, had gained a martial honor through genuine achievements and now held real power, being Liu Xunmei’s right-hand man.

Rumors had it that Wei Xian was well-known among the second patrol officer, Cao Ping.

As for Cao Jun, he was already quite famous in the Great Li military.

The three introduced themselves.

Guan Yiran and Liu Xunmei were close friends.

Thus, the only one who needed to be acquainted was the suddenly emerging Liu Qingfeng.

Not far away, a young man in white approached, riding on a child’s back, holding a branch, and shouting, “Giddy up!”

As he got closer, the young man laughed heartily, “I have a little donkey, who never complains of hunger!”

In Qingfeng City, a young woman in red led her horse out of the city, walking into the hills thirty miles outside the city under the night sky.

In the depths of winter, peach blossoms were blooming all along the way.

Li Baoping walked slowly while leading her horse, surveying her surroundings, enjoying the pleasant scenery.

Surrounded by green mountains, white clouds rose continuously from within the mountains.

A bit farther ahead lay her destination for this trip to Qingfeng City, a thatched cottage embraced by green water and wood.

Li Baoping glanced at the sky, where the large round moon hung high—was that not the biggest mooncake?

Thinking of this, Li Baoping suddenly smiled.

It felt as if she had transformed back into that little girl who once walked through green mountains and water with her little master uncle, her mind filled with such thoughts.

But back then, she had also carried a small bamboo box on her back, wearing little straw sandals.

The little girl in her red cotton jacket loved to revolve around her little master uncle, and no matter how far the mountains and roads were, she was never afraid.

Li Baoping’s gaze fell on the snow-white dagger at her waist and the sword-feeding gourd.

Li Baoping stood still.

The face amidst the peach blossoms stood beneath the bright moon.

(End of Chapter)

 **Chapter 768: Who Can Spare the World First?**

Li Baoping led her horse as she searched for someone—a fellow townsman and an elder, a friend of her grandfather's. One claimed to be unbeatable in the chess circles of Fortune and Prosperity Street, while the other touted himself as the top player of Peach Leaf Alley. The two would engage in their matches with utmost seriousness, as if the reputation of their respective neighborhoods was at stake. However, Li Baoping herself had little interest in chess. As for the prowess of her elders in the game, it was hard to say; what was more apparent were their ever-changing excuses for resigning, which were far less amusing than those of Mr. Qi.

Back in the day, the elder's ancestral home was at the very end of Peach Leaf Alley, not far from Fortune and Prosperity Street. Of course, for a little girl in a red cotton jacket, the small town felt like a vast playground with no distant corners. She would go to the Fairy Tomb to catch crickets, visit the Weaver Mother, scour Old Porcelain Mountain for fragments, fish for shrimp and crabs in Dragon Tail Creek, and gaze at the high-hanging mirrors of various households. She would leap down the steps in Dragon Riding Alley, and even from afar, she could smell the sweet aroma of peach blossom cakes and hear the chattering of swallows from a nearby nest.

Every tomorrow of Li Baoping's childhood seemed filled with endless fun and excitement, with each day packed to the brim. This compelled her to run swiftly, her feet moving like the wheels of a cart—never stopping. It felt as if running too fast would leave her childhood behind; as one grew up, childhood remained stationary, and every glance back revealed an ever-increasing distance, becoming more and more blurred.

Suddenly, an elderly man dressed in a high crown and flowing robes emerged from a thatched cottage. With a hearty laugh, he called out, “Baoping!” and hurried to open the gate, his face brimming with delight.

In what felt like just a few blinks, young Baoping had grown so much! Truly, a girl transforms greatly at eighteen, and she had become much more serene than before. 

Was she still that lively little girl who enjoyed climbing walls, twisting her ankles, unsure whether she had caught crabs to take home or if the crabs had simply decided to move in with her? 

Even so, the elder still genuinely cherished this junior. Some children always had a particularly good rapport with their elders. Here, Baoping from Fortune and Prosperity Street and Zhao Yao, who once served as Mr. Qi's attendant, were both among such children.

Li Baoping quickly approached the door, bowing respectfully. Straightening up with a smile, she greeted, “Grandpa Wei.”

The elder, surnamed Wei, named Benyuan, was once the head of the Wei clan, one of the four clans of the town's ten surnames. Before the Ruins of Lijuzhou collapsed, there had been correspondence with the outside world, and the messenger was a clear-eyed young lad in straw sandals. Although Wei Benyuan had only met him once, the memory lingered vividly. Sure enough, that boy from the alley had grown up; it hadn’t been twenty years yet, and he had already built a large enterprise and become Baoping's little master uncle. Such fateful connections were truly remarkable.

Wei Benyuan smiled upon seeing Li Baoping, “No need to tie up the horse; just let it roam free.”

Li Baoping released the reins and gently patted the horse's back, watching as the magnificent steed trotted off towards the creek for a drink.

“Where’s Sister Taoya?” Li Baoping asked.

Wei Benyuan replied, “Unfortunately, she went to the Fox Kingdom some years ago for training. She encountered a stroke of fortune and needs to hone her Dao heart. Once she becomes a Qi practitioner at the Ocean Observation level, I’ll have her accompany you on your travels.”

Li Baoping refrained from expressing any polite refusals; she wasn’t particularly keen on wandering the rivers and lakes with Sister Taoya. Being close to her was enough; she didn’t need constant companionship.

Being a good person didn’t mean being a pushover, nodding in agreement at every turn and never refusing anything. It was challenging to balance caring for oneself while also being considerate of others.

Moreover, Li Baoping had never liked being constrained. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been the last to arrive at school and the first to leave all those years ago.

Yet this didn’t hinder her respect for Mr. Qi.

The two walked into the courtyard, where stone tables and benches stood resilient against rain and sun—naturally made from celestial materials. The elder opened a small container and began to brew tea. The teaware was mostly porcelain, gleaming brightly; even those unfamiliar with fine craftsmanship would find joy in their beauty. These were some “second-rate” pieces acquired through connections at the kiln supervision office during Wei’s heyday in the town.

Just like Li Baoping's grandfather, who was a rare practitioner of the Dao in their small town, Wei Benyuan was also an early cultivator. However, Li Baoping’s grandfather focused on talismans and had exceptionally high attainments. It was unknown why he had declined the invitation from the Song clan's late emperor and had not become a court worshipper of the Great Li dynasty. In contrast, Wei Benyuan excelled at alchemy and had left his hometown early. The Wei clan's ancestral home remained unoccupied in the town, while the younger generation of Wei had spread out across different places, flourishing in their pursuits. The Wei family was lucky in terms of both fortune and the character and talents of their descendants, producing both scholars and cultivators.

Wei Benyuan had chosen this auspicious location on the outskirts of Clear Wind City, where peach orchards and streams harmonized splendidly, ideal for crafting alchemical furnaces. He hoped to break through the bottleneck of the Golden Core stage. This secluded paradise was a trade with the Xu clan of Clear Wind City; the former emperor had treated the local gentry well, allowing them to purchase the western celestial mountains at a very low price. However, Wei Benyuan found the noise and chaos of that location too bothersome and instead exchanged it for this long-cherished plot of ancestral land. Still, he had refused to become a vassal of the Xu clan, despite the repeated pleas of Xu Hu, the clan leader, and several attempts from the clan's matriarch.

Wei Benyuan felt a sense of concern. Li Baoping’s horse and the white scabbard of the dagger at her waist were both too conspicuous.

Unable to hold back, the elder asked, “Have you encountered any accidents on this trip?”

Before Baoping could respond, he continued in irritation, “That old Li really dares to be so careless! His poor chess skills and half-baked knowledge are bad enough, but now his mind is getting muddled too?”

Li Baoping laughed, “Grandpa Wei, I’m not a child anymore.”

Wei Benyuan replied, “I don't care how old Li is. If anyone bullies you, just tell Grandpa Wei. Although my realm isn’t high, I have enough connections to deal with such matters. Many are what I’ve left behind for my descendants, and I can’t take them to the grave…”

Li Baoping shook her head, “Really, Grandpa Wei, there’s no need for that. I haven’t made any enemies on this journey.”

Wei Benyuan joked, “Have all the suitors gone blind? Can’t they see how beautiful our Baoping has grown?”

Li Baoping sighed, “Grandpa Wei, please show a bit of elderliness.”

Wei Benyuan laughed, “Does my grandson really not see her worth?”

Li Baoping shook her head.

Suddenly, Wei Benyuan burst into laughter, “It would be strange if my Baoping liked that boy!”

Although the elder was never one to wear a stern face, he usually didn’t laugh so heartily with his own descendants.

He paused, having sensed Li Baoping's thoughts. He nodded, responding silently to indicate that there was no need to worry; there were no spies from the Xu clan in this area. The peach orchard itself was protected by a great formation, which even ordinary Golden Core practitioners would find hard to approach without making noise. Even though Xu Hu wasn’t a typical Golden Core practitioner, he possessed considerable strength and was well-versed in offensive techniques, known for his prowess throughout the continent. Thus, there was no need for concern about anyone using great powers to spy on the mountains and rivers.

Only then did Li Baoping take out two blue talismans and hand them to the elder, explaining, “These were sent by my brother from Northern Julu Prefecture. The letter didn’t say much; it only mentioned the names of the two talismans—one is a Golden Core talisman, and the other is a Mud Pill talisman. Originally, Grandpa should have delivered them in person, but since I was heading out, he let me take them along.”

Wei Benyuan accepted the talismans and, upon hearing their names, placed them on the table, shaking his head. “Baoping, although you are also a practitioner, you might not understand just how invaluable these two talismans are. I cannot accept them; doing so would mean I can never repay this favor in my lifetime. In cultivation, having a high realm is a great benefit, but it would make it awkward for me. If I must choose, I’d rather keep my heart than gain a higher realm.”

Wei Benyuan smiled, “It’s my own stubbornness. I appreciate your brother’s good intentions. He is indeed worthy of being the one I taught chess to since childhood; he truly doesn’t mean to be polite. You know what kind of person Grandpa Wei is, don’t you?”

The two blue talismans on the table, the Golden Core talisman, shimmered like a small door to a blessed land with golden light radiating from it, filling the room with a celestial glow.

The Mud Pill talisman featured a lotus symbol, resembling a high altar in a Daoist temple, surrounded by swirling purple qi, exuding an immense aura.

Li Baoping seemed to have anticipated this outcome, smiling, “My brother said that if you don’t accept the two talismans, I shouldn’t come to visit you again. I listen to my brother.”

Wei Benyuan waved his hand.

“Cultivation is serious business, especially regarding fundamentals; it’s not a child’s game, not something to be taken lightly.”

Li Baoping insisted, “I really do listen to my brother.”

Wei Benyuan frowned and asked, “Your brother is out there wandering in another land, and it’s certainly not easy for him. Why would he give away such good fortune?”

Wei Benyuan found it hard to criticize Li Xisheng, who was far away in Northern Julu, and Li Baoping, who was right before him; they were both excellent juniors, and he couldn’t bear to say anything harsh. So he began to scold the old Li again, “Old fool! Truly an old fool! Head filled with glue; no wonder his chess skills are so terrible, and his character is even worse!”

Li Baoping said, “Grandpa Wei, my brother is measured in his actions.”

Wei Benyuan thought for a moment, “I’ll accept them for now. Unless your brother makes it clear to me later, I’ll consider it as Grandpa Wei temporarily holding onto them for him.”

Li Baoping smiled, “That’s not my concern.”

Wei Benyuan reminded her, “Clear Wind City is a place where all sorts of people gather; if you plan to travel to the Fox Kingdom next, I’m truly worried. Smart people can be quite deceptive, so one must be cautious. Yet those who are both foolish and bad are the real troublemakers—they forget loyalty for profit, are swayed by appearances, and rely solely on gambling for success. It’s a chaotic world.”

Li Baoping nodded, “Alright, then let Grandpa Wei accompany me for a while. Otherwise, I fear that going to find Sister Taoya in the Fox Kingdom might bring me trouble.”

Wei Benyuan chuckled wryly, “With you putting it that way, it seems like Grandpa Wei is plotting something.”

Though Taoya was a servant of the Wei clan, Wei Benyuan had always treated her as his own junior. As for Li Baoping, she was even more like a granddaughter than a granddaughter.

Li Baoping laughed but said nothing.

Her grandfather once mentioned that Wei Benyuan’s inability to break through the Golden Core bottleneck was not due to a lack of talent but rather because he was too soft-hearted and kind. For a practitioner, being overly ambitious and seeking the Dao aggressively might not be wise, but being entirely without ambition was even worse.

Wei Benyuan asked, “Care to play a game of chess with me?”

Chess, fishing, and enjoying the reflections of flowers in water were regarded as the three great pleasures of the mountain dwellers, perfect for passing the time in leisure.

Li Baoping politely declined, “Grandpa Wei, you know I’ve never liked playing chess. Just watching you all play back then was already the limit of my patience.”

Wei Benyuan frowned and stood up, looking towards the summit of the green mountains, coldly laughing, “What’s this sneaking around? Can’t you show your face?!”

Had Li Baoping not come, Wei Benyuan might have had a pleasant exchange with the unexpected guest.

At the summit, a figure obscured by swirling clouds and mist looked down at the cottage nestled in the valley, smiling as he said, “The alchemical furnace is just starting up, and the celestial peaches are falling into bloom. Your alchemical skills may not be high, but you certainly know how to pick a place. The Xu clan treats you well, but it’s a pity you’ve chosen to court death, unwilling to even be a nominal worshipper. Ah, humans…”

After intentionally revealing himself to Wei Benyuan, this practitioner appeared nonchalant, exuding confidence, not in the least bit anxious.

His confidence did not stem from simply relying on his cultivation level; he had also meticulously laid down a formation surrounding the entire valley.

Breaking through Wei Benyuan’s mountain and water formation would require unraveling it thread by thread to find the flaw, and then striking with brute force. Once the formation was broken, there would be no more hiding.

Wei Benyuan gestured with his hand, trying to gather the mountain winds and water mists to obscure the stranger’s vision.

Unexpectedly, the practitioner, who spoke in the elegant language of Baoping Prefecture, seemed to possess profound techniques. The clouds that connected with the valley formation dissipated on their own.

Wei Benyuan looked around, realizing the other had some exquisite methods. The water in the creek began to shimmer with a ghostly green light, indicating the presence of hidden treasures.

That shimmering light quickly spread ashore, like a swarm of ants scattering.

Alchemy relies heavily on the balance of water and fire; the reason Wei Benyuan chose this place to forge his alchemical furnace was because of the vital water flow from the innate stream. Without hesitation, he silently recited an incantation, intending to use the technique of flipping the turtle’s back to shatter the water flow at the mountain's base, risking failure in alchemy to disrupt the opponent’s encroachment on the mountain and water formation.

The stranger didn’t care for Wei Benyuan’s clumsy tricks; his own treasured artifacts and unique secret techniques were not something a mere Golden Core practitioner could unravel.

After a moment’s thought, the practitioner worried that Wei Benyuan was trying to stir up some commotion to seek help from Clear Wind City, so he silently recited an incantation. The ghostly light that had come ashore immediately burrowed underground. Wei Benyuan’s “Mountain Flipping” technique couldn’t even stir the creek’s water.

The practitioner laughed, “Your techniques are quite good, but it’s a pity you’ve used them poorly. Once I capture you, I’ll imprison your soul and ask a few questions. What a delightful surprise! Fortune truly has come knocking, and it can’t be stopped.”

As his gaze shifted, he looked at Li Baoping and said, “The little girl’s family background is truly frighteningly rich; I didn’t even dare to act hastily before. I’ve followed you all this way and even helped you deal with two groups of minor cultivators. How do you plan to repay my life-saving grace? If you’re willing to pledge yourself to me as my personal maid, I wouldn’t mind. I’ll take a sword gourd, that auspicious blade, and those two unexpected talismans, and I’ll spare your life.”

Li Baoping patted the small wine gourd at her waist, “Come and take it if you dare. Enough with the nonsense.”

The stranger sneered, “A measly Golden Core who knows nothing of attack, who only knows how to brew some elixirs and make connections. At this critical moment, you can’t protect this little girl.”

Wei Benyuan’s heart sank in shock.

Firstly, he believed that the narrow blade Baoping carried was a treasure of the mountains, unaware of the true nature of the silver gourd. On the contrary, the man at the mountain peak seemed to know exactly what he was dealing with. He even called the narrow blade by its name, having followed Baoping for a while, clearly confident of his footing. This man’s cultivation level was at least at the bottleneck of the Golden Core stage, and if he were a venerable Nascent Soul who had been dormant for countless years, he would be even more formidable.

Wei Benyuan felt a deep regret; if he had agreed to become a vassal of the Xu clan, he would have had the means to signal for help, and perhaps the opponent wouldn’t have dared to be so bold. Yet now, the mountain and water formation that isolated him from the outside world had become a prison.

Taking a deep breath, Wei Benyuan steadied his Dao heart and spoke silently to Li Baoping, “Don’t be afraid, Baoping. Grandpa Wei will definitely protect you as you leave. If I destroy the alchemical furnace, it will create a great commotion, and they’ll surely notice in Clear Wind City. After you leave the Peach Orchard, don’t look back; just head to Clear Wind City. I may not be strong in combat, but with the right timing and location, I can definitely keep you safe.”

The stranger shook his head, “I find that hard to believe. If breaking through the Golden Core bottleneck is this difficult, what’s the point of living?”

Wei Benyuan felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave, knowing that this was definitely a deep-rooted Nascent Soul.

The Great Li cavalry had shattered the mountains and rivers of a continent, leaving many hidden cultivators from the mountains to come out and take advantage of the chaos.

Li Baoping said, “If I had known this would happen, I would have sent the talismans to you earlier.”

Wei Benyuan laughed in anger, “What nonsense are you talking about!”

Li Baoping didn’t explain further, her heart rippling, listening intently; some matters were perhaps best left unspoken.

The practitioner’s attention was still largely fixed on Li Baoping’s narrow blade.

In terms of earthly beauty, it seemed insignificant compared to the pursuit of eternal life. 

That narrow blade, named Auspicious Sign, was a divine artifact from the ancient Shu Kingdom, a national treasure capable of suppressing and gathering martial fortunes. Such a treasure could be classified among the “treasures of mountains and rivers.” Although it had the classification of a magical artifact, it was essentially a semi-divine weapon.

The sword gourd appeared to be of extremely high quality, but its exact nature was hard to determine for now.

In any case, after obtaining the goods, it would be wise to travel to another continent, as the current Baoping Prefecture was no longer a suitable place for wild cultivators to thrive.

Li Baoping whispered, “Grandpa Wei, if a fight breaks out, I can’t afford to lose this place of cultivation. It’s alright; I’ll have my brother compensate you later.”

Wei Benyuan couldn’t help but smile bitterly. Was this really the time for such discussions?

The practitioner had already found the way to break the formation and was cautiously weighing his options, feeling that all unexpected events had been accounted for.

When practitioners from the “Celestial Scribe” sect descended for training, they often liked to pay their respects to the mountain. Since this little girl’s backing was someone like Wei Benyuan, who didn’t even have the qualifications to become a guest in Clear Wind City’s Xu Hu’s court, it was very safe.

It was impossible for a formidable Nascent Soul practitioner not to be cautious.

No matter how high the realm of a wilderness cultivator was, they only had one life.

Those who rested in the halls of their ancestors, enjoying the fruits of their labor, even if their realms were low, had two lives!

Thus, it was a decisive moment to act.

In an instant, the practitioner’s figure shimmered uncertainly, growing as large as a mountain, taking on the form of an ancient mountain spirit. Not only that, but the golden body of the law avatar had green dragon-like arms wrapped around it, wielding a great halberd. The spiritual energy of the surrounding mountains and waters was in complete chaos, and this massive “deity,” embodying the essence of mountains and waters, descended from the peak towards the creek-side cottage, carrying the pressure of a mountain.

In mid-air, the golden body laughed heartily, “You little girl, what a big mouth! Your brother? If you’re trying to scare me with your ancestor, I might believe you a little! What, is your brother a true martial artist from Zhenwu Mountain, or the great swordsman of the Yellow River from Thunderstorm Garden?”

As Wei Benyuan was about to summon a precious Golden Core to fight with the Nascent Soul rogue, Li Baoping took a step forward, her thumb nudging the narrow blade out of its sheath by an inch. In her other sleeve, a different object quietly appeared. This object, once revealed, emitted no trace of aura, making it far less noticeable than the narrow blade.

But at that moment, the golden body of the law avatar inexplicably hovered mid-air, neither ascending nor descending.

It wasn’t as if the little girl had stumbled while jumping from a wall; she hadn’t even landed yet!

Li Baoping turned her head to look elsewhere.

Atop another green mountain peak stood a young man wearing a pink Daoist robe, floating gently in the air, extending two fingers and spinning them lightly.

With each step he took, a white cloud would drift in from the distance, forming steps that landed perfectly beneath the young man's feet.

The enormous law avatar, seemingly immobilized, began to flip, becoming a puppet in someone else’s hands.

Wei Benyuan felt shaken.

What a powerful figure at the mountain peak!

Was there such a person in Baoping Prefecture who possessed such a bearing?

A Taoist High Master? Or was it the Heavenly Sovereign of the Divine Script Sect, Qi Zhen? It was impossible; that lineage of Daoists had strict rules; their hats and robes could not have a single flaw.

Moreover, how could the esteemed Qi lord come to Clear Wind City for a stroll?

The young man’s brightly colored robe billowed as if made of clouds.

Finally, the young “Daoist” lightly leaped, sitting cross-legged upon the head of the golden body law avatar. His fingers curled, giving a soft tap, much like an elder admonishing a mischievous younger relative, “You like to act all high and mighty, huh? Your ancestor is right here, what a laugh.”

Wei Benyuan felt no sense of relief; instead, he grew increasingly anxious, fearing this was a conflict between tigers and wolves. If the latter harbored ill intentions, he wouldn’t be able to protect Baoping.

Wei Benyuan murmured, “Just casually severing the connection between heaven and earth, how am I going to deal with this? What should I do?”

The Nascent Soul rogue, rendered mute by the sudden turn of events, lamented internally. It wasn't that he didn’t want to escape, but he truly couldn’t move. The other party had casually created a barrier isolating the golden body law avatar, making it impossible to use either his Golden Core or Nascent Soul techniques to escape. How would he find a way out of this deadlock? Unless he was a sword cultivator of the Nascent Soul stage, but if he were such a sword immortal, would he need to hide and seek for hundreds of years?

The young Daoist casually sat atop the towering law avatar, smiling at Wei Benyuan, “Wei Benyuan, I owe your Wei family a favor from a long time ago. I won’t go into details; old stories are just dust, no need to dwell on them.”

Of course, Liu Chicheng was fabricating a story.

He had no choice; Gu Can didn’t want to reveal his identity, so Liu Chicheng had to come up with a flimsy excuse. However, mountain practitioners were generally gullible, and it was very believable.

For example, Wei Benyuan believed him to some extent.

Li Baoping, however, did not buy it at all.

Liu Chicheng tilted his head, continuing to restrain the golden body law avatar. A mere junior Nascent Soul practitioner could easily break free from this gentle restraint; he just didn’t dare to act impulsively.

This was correct.

After traveling with Gu Can, he had grown tired of the dullness. 

Thus, Liu Chicheng felt he lacked a companion to alleviate his boredom, and having a junior Nascent Soul practitioner from the mountains accompany him was a meager consolation.

If Liu Chicheng’s most despised “Celestial Scribe” practitioner were here, he would already be dead.

Attacking the young would lead to confronting the old? How old? Should he wrestle with someone from Baidi City? No matter how formidable a cultivator was, Liu Chicheng would stand still; his opponent wouldn’t dare to act.

In any case, he would be heading to the Central Divine Continent soon, and he didn’t want to leave behind any mess. Liu Chicheng was concerned that Gu Can wouldn’t focus on his cultivation.

Gu Can was a promising seedling; only by facing life-and-death situations repeatedly could he grow quickly.

He was not afraid of “pulling seedlings to encourage growth.”

This was exactly what Liu Chicheng’s brother most favored—promising talents.

Suddenly, Liu Chicheng squinted.

It seemed that his brother had a penchant for trouble?

And this little girl?

Moreover, his brother’s chess skills appeared to have hit a bottleneck, nearing a breakthrough. Just as he was preparing to return to Baidi City, he happened to encounter her. Wasn’t that fortuitous?

Liu Chicheng laughed heartily, turning his gaze towards a certain direction, speaking silently, “It’s not up to you anymore. Perfect, the three of us will head back together.”

Gu Can ceased hiding his figure, replying silently, “Liu Chicheng, I advise you not to do this; otherwise, once I succeed in my studies in Baidi City, you’ll be the first I kill.”

There was no impatience in Gu Can’s tone; his response was measured, just as he was in character.

Liu Chicheng smiled, “Am I afraid of you? I might fear you in the future, but that’s a matter for later.”

Li Baoping, sensing the tension, loosened the scabbard and tightened her grip on the peach talisman.

This was given to her by her brother, saying that in times of trouble, with a thought, the talisman would resonate. Even if a nefarious person had some skills, she wouldn’t need to worry if her heart remained calm.

Li Baoping shook the peach talisman vigorously.

Was her brother lying?

No response.

Li Baoping exhaled and rubbed her palm, yet still, no reaction.

Never mind.

Li Baoping planned to pull out a few sheets of paper from her sleeve, all copied from various texts, ones that resonated with her.

She didn’t blame her brother, Li Xisheng, but she felt a bit miffed that her little master uncle wasn’t around.

Li Baoping subtly wrinkled her nose.

Forget it, what else could she do? Tomorrow, she would no longer hold such feelings for her little master uncle.

Gu Can made no movement.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to intervene; it was simply meaningless.

The disparity in their realms was too great.

Gu Can felt a surge of anger within.

This unpredictable Liu Chicheng must die at his hands in the future.

So, Gu Can immediately communicated with Li Baoping, “Li Baoping, I am Gu Can from Mud Bottle Alley. Don’t act impulsively; just stay alive.”

Li Baoping shook her head, “I don’t want to die, but I will not live in disgrace.”

Then she smiled, “Isn’t it allowed for others to err in good intentions? Besides, it’s not a major issue. Gu Can, I must thank you. Stay safe, and remember to tell my little master uncle that I miss him dearly.”

Liu Chicheng glanced at the paper in her hand, noticing the characters flowing on it!

His brows furrowed, and his expression grew serious.

If it was related to the Academic Scribe, it could be troublesome.

After all, the entire Haoran world was a realm of scholars.

On the other side of the peach orchard, a scholar in a Confucian robe had initially chuckled at Li Baoping shaking the peach talisman. 

It was rare to see the little girl looking so innocent and adorable.

At this moment, he took a deep breath, stepping forward to Li Baoping's side, looking up at the golden body law avatar and the pink-robed Daoist.

Li Baoping exclaimed, “Brother?!”

Li Xisheng nodded, turning to smile, “Your brother is angry and doesn’t want to talk much.”

Li Baoping laughed, “My brother can get angry too?”

Li Xisheng smiled and nodded.

Liu Chicheng had an immediate sense of foreboding.

Yet, this young scholar didn’t appear to have a high realm. He didn’t seem to be using any tricks, so he definitely wasn’t a celestial being, nor was he at the Ascension stage… Liu Chicheng wasn't delusional.

Since leaving Baidi City, he had faced two significant setbacks in a thousand years; one was being personally suppressed by the Grand Celestial Master, and he didn’t even need that figure to summon any seals or draw swords—just pure technique would suffice. 

The reason the Grand Celestial Master acted personally was to signal to Baidi City and prevent Liu Chicheng’s brother from intervening.

The second time was in a small decrepit temple, where he inexplicably received a strike from a sword, a simple wooden sword that effortlessly broke through Liu Chicheng’s protective formation.

In an instant.

Liu Chicheng’s instincts were solidified.

Time stood still.

Outside his little world, a larger realm appeared.

Li Baoping, Wei Benyuan, the golden body law avatar, and Gu Can on the mountain peak—all thoughts ceased to move.

Except for Liu Chicheng, who had been intentionally left unrestrained.

In this tranquil moment, with the heavens high and the earth broad, millions of miles spread out.

Liu Chicheng felt helpless.

It seemed there was no way to fight back.

Clearly, he was up against an unreasonable opponent.

“Cultivators should always respect the heavens and maintain a sense of conscience,” Li Xisheng said slowly as he approached, “That’s enough; this is the view of a scholar.”

Liu Chicheng laughed, “Alright, alright, let’s discuss reason. I’m someone who listens well to scholars’ reasoning.”

Li Xisheng continued, “Now, I will speak to you from the perspective of Baoping’s older brother.”

Liu Chicheng was about to distance himself from the scene, using his little world to collide with the larger one to escape.

As for the matter of realms and the dignity of a Nascent Soul cultivator, he tossed it aside; it didn’t matter whether he picked it up or left it.

Suddenly, a middle-aged Daoist’s law avatar appeared between heaven and earth.

Liu Chicheng’s legs softened, and just as he was about to rise, he sat back down.

He struggled to suppress the almost shattered Dao heart, swaying unsteadily as he stood, bowing in silence.

Li Xisheng asked, “What good is an apology if you disregard the principles of the Dao?”

The towering middle-aged Daoist raised an arm and brought it down.

With one slap, he sent both Liu Chicheng and the Nascent Soul rogue’s law avatar crashing into the earth.

No technique, no divine artifact; the law avatar descended with just a single slap.

Liu Chicheng lay in the pit, his mind racing with a single thought: could the scholars of Baoping Prefecture please stop this?

As Li Xisheng withdrew his law avatar and approached the pit, looking down at the nearly lifeless pink-robed Daoist, he calculated with his fingers, sneering, “When you return to Baidi City, tell your brother I’ll come to play chess with him.”

Liu Chicheng felt despondent.

His brother had once jokingly mentioned that the art of chess was enough to prevent Baidi City from ever raising the banner declaring “First in the World to Spare” again. 

While Cui Zhan had a chance, it was slim, for that person wasn’t in the Haoran world but in the Azure Sky’s Baiyu Capital.

That was the second disciple of the Dao Ancestor, Lu Chen, the eldest disciple of the Master.

What kind of Daoist would he be, one could only imagine.

Liu Chicheng struggled to rise again, remaining silent. He was sincerely respectful, bowing properly in a traditional Daoist fashion.

Once Li Baoping “came back to her senses,” her brother Li Xisheng still stood beside her, and the pink-robed Daoist remained perched atop the golden body law avatar.

Everything was as it had been.

Liu Chicheng appeared to smile, yet he was drenched in cold sweat.

Time flowed backward!

Crucially, Wei Benyuan remained frozen at a certain point in the river of time, still motionless.

“Earlier, I spoke with that esteemed figure; everything is fine now,” Li Xisheng said softly, smiling. “This time I came, let’s not mention it to Grandpa Wei, or he’ll insist I play chess. Back in our hometown, there were only a few chess manuals, and Grandpa Wei’s constant ramblings about chess theory can be quite annoying.”

Li Baoping nodded earnestly.

Li Xisheng’s figure dissipated, returning to the remote vassal state in Northern Julu Prefecture.

Such intercontinental travel, given his current realm, was not easy.

Thus, swift come and go was necessary.

Li Xisheng suddenly smiled, “You’ve grown up without saying hello to your older brother.”

Li Baoping grinned widely.

Li Xisheng shook his head with a smile and vanished.

Wei Benyuan returned to his usual state.

Then Liu Chicheng immediately stood up, preparing to take his leave, claiming he was merely joking with the little girl.

As for the Nascent Soul practitioner beneath him, he had already retracted his law avatar, leaving alongside Liu Chicheng, who communicated silently with Gu Can, “I’ll be waiting for you in Clear Wind City. No rush; you go ahead and catch up.”

Gu Can stifled his doubts, riding the wind towards the thatched cottage, directly addressing Li Baoping, “Li Baoping, I’m sorry for today’s events. In terms of heart and matter, I bear half the blame.”

Li Baoping was taken aback.

This side of Gu Can made it hard to understand why her little master uncle had been so heartbroken back then.

Had Gu Can changed so much in just a few short years?

Li Baoping thought for a moment and told Wei Benyuan she would take a walk by the creek with this fellow townsman.

Wei Benyuan, still in the dark, nodded, “Be careful.”

Li Baoping walked alongside Gu Can by the creek.

The two had only crossed paths in their childhood but had never spoken.

One was lively, the other quiet. They barely acknowledged each other when they met in their hometown, merely passing by.

At most, the red cotton jacket girl would vaguely remember the small boy with a runny nose.

The small-nosed child thought the little girl in red seemed nothing like a wealthy child, as she didn't appear to enjoy the comforts of life.

These two were arguably the naughtiest children in the town, differing only by their backgrounds—one was born on Fortune and Prosperity Street, while the other in Mud Bottle Alley.

The girl in the red jacket dashed through streets and alleys, leaving even the geese in her wake.

The small-nosed boy, however, preferred to stay put under the sun, fishing for eels by the old locust tree, or sitting beneath it, shooting at yellow sparrows with a slingshot.

Gu Can’s family owned a few tea fields, and as a small child, he carried a bamboo basket that fit him well. He would pick tea leaves faster than those helping out, but he didn’t enjoy such work, flattening the tea leaves in his basket and then sneaking off to a shaded spot to rest.

After all, Liu Xianyang was his only friend; how could he not want to enjoy himself?

Yet it was still only the small-nosed boy from Mud Bottle Alley who was his only true kin in this world.

The creek was shallow, crystal clear.

The two remained silent for a long time.

Li Baoping finally spoke, “You should think more about the hardships of my little master uncle.”

Gu Can responded, “I’ve thought about it.”

Li Baoping smiled, “Don’t misunderstand; regarding you and the matters of the Book Simplifying Lake, my little master uncle hasn’t said much. He usually doesn’t like to speak ill of others behind their backs.”

Gu Can chuckled.

Of course, he wouldn’t misinterpret it.

Moreover, what good would it do to discuss it? Gu Can had never liked suffering, yet he was quite adept at enduring scoldings and beatings.

Deep down, Gu Can didn’t care at all about others' opinions.

Even Chen Ping’an didn’t know that Gu Can had visited Fortune and Prosperity Street and Peach Leaf Alley before him. He had heard Liu Xianyang mention that there were many wealthy people there, and that their pockets were often so full that they dropped coins on the ground. Gu Can had gone to pick up coins, but after failing to find any, he had lost patience, feeling quite angry when he caused a ruckus in Peach Leaf Alley, not letting a single peach tree escape his grasp. Whenever he encountered passersby, he would pretend to squat under the tree to watch ants.

Now reflecting on it, Gu Can thought those fallen peach blossoms, leaves, and branches should have been gathered and hidden away.

Li Baoping continued, “But since my little master uncle is so familiar with you, if you ever achieve even the slightest success, he wouldn’t hesitate to praise you a few times. The first time my little master uncle traveled far, almost all his discussions about our hometown revolved around you and Liu Xianyang. However, after returning from Book Simplifying Lake, he seldom mentioned you again.”

Li Baoping raised her hand, pointing to her eyes, “Here is where one speaks the most truth. My little master uncle didn’t say anything, yet he said everything.”

Gu Can responded with a quiet “Mm.”

Li Baoping said, “That’s it for our conversation.”

Gu Can didn’t linger, preparing to take his leave. He suddenly stopped, smiling, “Li Baoping, thank you.”

Li Baoping laughed and asked, “Now you remember to be polite?”

Gu Can’s eyes sparkled as he shook his head, “Not politeness; it’s because you were the first to accompany him out of his hometown. Without you by his side back then, he perhaps wouldn’t have reached Gu Can’s side later.”

Li Baoping laughed.

Gu Can laughed too.

Recalling the past, in that little temple filled with names on the walls, Liu Xianyang stood on a ladder while Chen Ping’an held it steady. Gu Can had tossed bits of charcoal to Liu Xianyang, writing their three names.

The positioning was quite elevated.

Finally, Gu Can said, “Li Baoping, you should see Chen Ping’an sooner than I will. When you do, tell him that Gu Can is in Baidi City, cultivating the Dao!” 

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 769: Young Zhu Lian

Outside Clear Wind City, on a small hill in a desolate area, beneath a solitary wild peach tree, two figures stared at each other, eyes wide open.

Liu Chicheng glared fiercely, not wasting any time to wipe the blood off his face.

The pink robe he wore was as vibrant as the peach blossoms. 

The Yuan Ying wild cultivator, who had been captured and brought here, revealed his true appearance—a short “youth” with hair as white as snow, his face showing signs of age.

What was peculiar, however, was the long string of ancient jade pendants and small bottles hanging from the white jade belt adorned with a dragon pattern around his waist.

This man swayed precariously, still doing his utmost to maintain his stance, fearing that with a mere tilt of his head, the man in the pink robe in front of him would slap him to death.

At this moment, he felt like a person about to indulge in a feast of rich dishes when suddenly the table was overturned, leaving him with no chopsticks and a head full of bumps from the falling table.

Until now, he still couldn't comprehend how he had fallen from the peak of the Yuan Ying realm to the pitiful state of just finishing his Golden Core stage.

What puzzled him even more was the remarkable skills of the man before him, who seemed to be injured as well. But the question lingered—had he even struck first?

He had once been a formidable figure, a hidden emperor behind several small nations, known for seeking treasures while concealing his identity. His reputation was not small throughout the entire Baoping Continent. He had clashed with Li Tuanjing from Thunder Garden, taking a few strikes yet miraculously surviving, and was pursued for miles by an old immortal from the Divine Scripture Sect without meeting his end. In his early years, he had been both an enemy and a friend to Liu Laocheng at Book Scroll Lake, having explored the secret realms of the ancient Shu Kingdom together, where he had suffered greatly due to an unequal division of spoils, almost losing half his life to Liu Laocheng. Even after Liu Laocheng ascended in status, he had still managed to ambush and kill several direct disciples of the Palace of Willow Island who had ventured out, leaving Liu Laocheng unable to find him, leading to his eventual retreat.

His life had been filled with excitement and bizarre experiences, but nothing could compare to the utter confusion he felt today. Who was this person? How had he attacked? Why had he come here? Would he die here today...?

Liu Chicheng shook off the blood on his hands and smiled, “Thank you.”

The “youth,” a wild cultivator of the mountains and rivers, seeing Liu Chicheng as a Daoist immortal, respectfully bowed and said softly, “I am Chai Bofu, with the Dao name Longbo. I believe you have heard of me.”

“An extraordinary figure, known for his assassination skills and escape techniques, who is also proficient in water techniques,” he thought. It was rumored that he had once fought with Liu Zhimao of Book Scroll Lake over a heavenly secret manual, their battle so fierce it nearly turned their brains to mush.

Liu Chicheng gritted his teeth and replied, “I’ve heard of your grand uncle. I am Liu Chicheng, a person of the White Water Kingdom. Have you heard of me?”

Chai Bofu braced himself and said, “I am but a shallow person; I have not heard of your esteemed name.”

Liu Chicheng fell back against the peach tree, his expression despondent. “Finding chicken droppings in a crevice and digging up dog feces next to rotten mud—after struggling to accumulate a bit of cultivation, I get slapped and it’s all gone! I don’t want to live anymore. Just kill me!”

Chai Bofu remained completely still, not pretending to be frightened, nor would he utter any heartfelt words. When dealing with high-level cultivators who were also reclusive, the most unwise thing to do was to act clever and overstep boundaries.

Liu Chicheng began to close his eyes to rest, repeatedly bumping his head against the peach tree, muttering, “Cut down the peach tree, spoil the scenery.”

Then, Liu Chicheng suddenly slapped himself hard across the face, as if waking up. His face broke into a smile. “I should be happy! Who in this world can survive such a calamity as I have? There must be blessings ahead, surely great fortune awaits!”

Liu Chicheng stood up, transforming from listlessness to vigor in an instant, straightening his back, shaking his sleeves, and producing three incense sticks. He then looked at the foolishly standing wild cultivator and glared, “Why aren’t you leaving? You’re wasting my time to burn incense and pray to the immortals!”

Liu Chicheng took a deep breath. “No, no, I must be kind to others, treat people with courtesy, and uphold the principles of a scholar.”

Chai Bofu stepped back, daring to stand firm only when he was a good twenty feet away.

There was no sense of grievance here; a wild cultivator from the mountains who could reach Chai Bofu’s level certainly had some cunning.

Li Tuanjing from Thunder Garden had once laughed, saying the deepest cultivators in the world were not the renowned immortal masters, but the wild cultivators, who had no choice but to resort to unconventional methods, otherwise, the Dao would be within reach.

Liu Chicheng gathered his thoughts, dispelled distractions, began to chant, and then rubbed the incense head slowly until it caught fire, seemingly performing three bows to heaven and earth.

In reality, the first bow was to the ancestors of the White Emperor City who had imparted teachings unto him.

The second bow was to the scholar in green robes from the ancient temple who had once presented a sword, his swordsmanship exceptional and his righteous aura unparalleled.

The third bow was to that imposing “middle-aged Daoist.”

Gu Can, cautious and meticulous, while riding the wind, noticed Liu Chicheng’s presence, which he had not deliberately concealed. He landed near the wild peach tree, and only after Liu Chicheng finished his three bows did he say, “What if? Why bother?”

Liu Chicheng remained silent, waiting until the incense had nearly burned out before he resumed his usual demeanor, smiling broadly. “Alright, alright, don’t rub salt into my wounds! My heart aches at the moment.”

Gu Can didn’t even spare a glance at the wild cultivator, but his next words revealed his true feelings, “What’s he keeping around for?”

Liu Chicheng asked with a grin, “Gu Can, do you wish to be my junior brother or my nephew?”

Gu Can replied, “It’s not for me to choose. Why ask?”

In these years, if a stranger met Gu Can for the first time, they would find him a gentle, courteous scholar, a well-mannered young man.

However, after traveling together with Liu Chicheng on their northern journey, they both knew each other's true nature very well.

When Gu Can said he bore no grudge for today, it was an insult to Liu Chicheng.

Gu Can spoke bluntly, “You once said that Mr. Qi had greatly benefited you, imparting you a piece of golden advice that cleared your path and broke down barriers, allowing you to smoothly ascend to the fifth realm. You have made a promise to Mr. Qi that when Chen Ping’an visits White Emperor City, you will owe him a favor, so you must act with kindness. Now weigh the consequences of your actions. What you did today is nothing but ungratefulness and creating enmity with me. Liu Chicheng, you truly live up to the reputation of a high figure from White Emperor City, acting as you please. I am increasingly looking forward to White Emperor City; this might be the only right thing you did today.”

Gu Can didn’t use secret words to communicate with Liu Chicheng.

Liu Chicheng glanced at the wild cultivator Chai Bofu, then withdrew his gaze, helplessly saying, “Is it that you want Brother Longbo to die so badly?”

Gu Can remained silent.

Liu Chicheng, patient, explained, “First, yesterday’s matters belong to yesterday, and tomorrow’s matters belong to tomorrow. For example, if Chen Ping’an wants to argue with me later, I’ll bring up my senior brother, and Chen Ping’an will die. Then I’ll use Mr. Qi’s kindness as leverage, essentially saving Chen Ping’an’s life and thus repaying a favor.”

“Second, regardless of current outcomes, my initial thought was simple: creating enmity with you, compared to helping my senior brother find another path of ascension, Gu Can, think for yourself, if you were me, what would you choose?”

“Lastly, I respect and fear my senior brother, but I cherish and long for White Emperor City. I don’t want it to merely be a stepping stone. Someone needs to appear to provide my senior brother with a reason to convince himself.”

Gu Can understood everything Liu Chicheng said, except for that last sentence.

No matter how twisted or convoluted Liu Chicheng’s reasoning seemed to Gu Can, it was evident that Liu Chicheng genuinely believed in his reasoning, speaking from the heart.

Gu Can could choose not to agree, but he had to present his own “reason,” whether through fists, Dao methods, or words.

Ultimately, Liu Chicheng always looked down upon Gu Can, his thoughts and vision reaching the highest point of White Emperor City, to the seniors, as well as to others of the same generation.

Liu Chicheng wished to take on disciples on behalf of his master, but his greatest enemies, or obstacles, were those same peers.

Chai Bofu felt a chill run down his spine; in the path of cultivation, after experiencing numerous hardships, he felt despair for the first time in his life.

The three words “White Emperor City” pressed down on him like a mountain, suffocating him.

In the world of nine continents, among countless wild cultivators, there was only one sacred ground in their hearts—the White Emperor City of the Central Region, presided over by the universally recognized foremost figure of the demonic path.

Yet here was this pink-robed Daoist, conversing with a young man, each sentence filled with references to White Emperor City, senior brothers, and junior brothers.

So, when the two fell silent, Chai Bofu finally spoke, “Senior Liu, Gu Can, how can I avoid death?”

The one truly asking was the youth with a low cultivation level.

Since Liu Chicheng had detained him here, his life was at least secure. However, Gu Can had enmity with him, both old and new.

Chai Bofu had heard of Gu Can primarily because of Liu Zhimao, the River Crossing True Lord. It was rumored that a few years back, Gu Can, as Liu Zhimao’s direct disciple, had a Yuan Ying water dragon, wreaking havoc at Book Scroll Lake. Then for reasons unknown, he suddenly went silent, losing both the water dragon and himself. Afterward, the entire Book Scroll Lake was occupied by foreign cultivators, becoming a territory of the Yuguizong of Tongyezhou. Those who were bold had likely been fed to the True Realm Sect, realizing the trend, as if taking a divine bath in Book Scroll Lake, washing away all the dirt of wild cultivators, transforming into proper disciples of sects.

Chai Bofu felt that his luck had hit rock bottom.

How had he encountered this little demon? How had Gu Can gotten tangled up with a river-crossing dragon like Liu Chicheng, connected to White Emperor City?

Liu Chicheng pointed at Gu Can. “For matters of life and death, ask my future little junior brother.”

The higher Gu Can’s Dao achievements, the smoother Liu Chicheng’s return to White Emperor City would be.

Gu Can said, “If you die, then you needn’t worry about dying.”

Liu Chicheng let out an incredulous laugh.

That statement was quite novel.

Chai Bofu spoke somberly, “Gu Can, why are you being so aggressive? Are you intent on killing me? Even if I have past grievances with your master, you are a wild cultivator, and so am I. This grudge means nothing.”

Liu Chicheng playfully asked, “Brother Longbo, what about you and Liu Zhimao?”

Chai Bofu replied, “It was over a secret text regarding the River Crossing…”

At this point, Chai Bofu suddenly realized, “Gu Can, could it be that Liu Zhimao truly regards you as someone to inherit his legacy? Has he learned that text and fears that my presence will disrupt your fortune?”

Chai Bofu muttered to himself, “Liu Zhimao is the most petty and narrow-minded; he would gladly eliminate all fellow cultivators in the world. How could he be willing to pass on the fundamental method of the Dao to you?”

Gu Can naturally would not expose the truth; Liu Zhimao had had little control over breaking through during his seclusion and could very well meet his end. Otherwise, why would he have passed the water technique to Gu Can, who would then attract the genuine owner of the technique, Liu Chicheng?

After being schemed against by Cui Chen, Liu Chicheng had once taken in a named disciple, a boy who had been a disciple of the old demon Mi, named Yuan Tiandi. Unfortunately, Liu Chicheng had invested some effort but had not achieved satisfactory results and felt embarrassed to keep him by his side. He left him on a small hill, allowing the boy to fend for himself, accompanied only by a little fox spirit. When Liu Chicheng parted from them, he didn’t give any aid to his named disciple, but instead, he gifted that little fox spirit a cultivation method and two protective artifacts. However, it was likely that her future cultivation would be lacking in diligence, and as for whether Yuan Tiandi could learn anything from her or what enmities might arise between them, Liu Chicheng cared little. The path of cultivation ultimately depended on destiny.

Liu Chicheng didn’t mind being the wild man of beautiful women but was unwilling to become anyone’s wild father. His past assistance to that little fox spirit wasn’t out of pity for her circumstances but rather a reflection of his own compassion.

After parting with Yuan Tiandi, Liu Chicheng wandered alone, not expecting that his River Crossing secret text would end up in the hands of wild cultivator Liu Zhimao, who had made quite a name for himself, earning the title of River Crossing True Lord.

In life, there were always times when one sowed flowers and got no blooms, while one could inadvertently plant willows to create a shade.

Gu Can glanced at Chai Bofu, suddenly smiling. “Forget it. In the future, let’s walk the Dao together and exchange techniques.”

Since Liu Chicheng didn’t want to kill anyone, and Gu Can was uncertain of his own abilities, he might as well keep Chai Bofu around.

Liu Chicheng didn’t think much of Chai Bofu’s level. Even if he returned to the Yuan Ying realm, what would it matter? Even if he became Liu Chicheng’s servant in White Emperor City, what significance would it hold? The cultivation in White Emperor City was not like what one would find in ordinary sects, where they depended on mutual support and ties.

The real reason Liu Chicheng spared this person was that he hoped his senior brother could exploit the relationship between Chai Bofu and Li Baoping to his advantage, helping his senior brother strategize against that “middle-aged Daoist.” Even if White Emperor City gained just a sliver of a chance to win, it would be a tremendous boon.

Liu Chicheng believed his little scheme had probably already been calculated by that “middle-aged Daoist.” No worries; when the time came, it would all be a headache for his senior brother.

Junior brothers had their duties, and senior brothers had their strategies.

The three of them then walked towards Clear Wind City without using wind for travel.

Liu Chicheng casually remarked, “Brother Longbo, your six life-bound items are rather flamboyant. Two of them are merely ranked as spiritual artifacts. What’s going on?”

Chai Bofu smiled bitterly. “For wild cultivators, starting out is the hardest. Among the wild cultivators of the lower five realms, having even one or two spiritual artifacts successfully refined as life-bound items is already a great fortune. Once my realm is sufficient and I have enough magical treasures, then I might consider forcibly replacing these deeply rooted life-bound items that are tied to my life. It can be done, but it’s too risky, especially if my enemies learn of it. Such seclusion isn’t just courting death. Even if I survive, if those gluttonous sect disciples catch wind, secretly coming at me, breaking my retreat, it would be a heavy loss.”

Chai Bofu sighed. “Before forming the Golden Core, if I provoke a low-level enemy, replacing life-bound items wouldn’t be a problem. Unfortunately, wild cultivators can only form a core after attracting the attention of some Golden Core peers and some sect disciples who cry out for help after being beaten. Sometimes, when I look around, I truly feel surrounded by troubles and enemies.”

When immortal sects “visit,” whether seeking revenge or visiting relatives, it’s not like being a common folk traveling a hundred miles away; no matter how vast the continent, once it comes to discussing establishing a sect, it feels small. In places with a bit better aura, there are local tyrants everywhere, and the mountains and rivers, deep waters and lakes—who isn’t occupied and managed by an immortal sect? Not to mention the sects of the immortal world, or the mountain gods and river deities. The reason wild cultivators find it hard to gain a foothold is that they lack advantages in timing, geography, and support.

Liu Chicheng nodded, indicating understanding.

Gu Can smiled slightly.

Chai Bofu, lost in thought, was suddenly seized by Liu Chicheng, his head pressed down, as the Golden Core was casually shattered. He collapsed to the ground, covered in blood, convulsing.

Earlier, when he fell from the Yuan Ying realm to the Golden Core, it was too abstract, and Chai Bofu hadn’t suffered too much. This time, falling from the Golden Core to the Dragon Gate realm was a genuine trial by fire.

Liu Chicheng grinned. “Alright, now you can safely replace your life-bound items, or else you’ll find it hard to break through that Yuan Ying bottleneck. Brother Longbo, don’t thank me.”

Liu Chicheng spun a finger, casually forming a formation to help Chai Bofu conceal his aura.

The techniques transmitted from White Emperor City were eclectic. Liu Chicheng once had a talented senior sister who had vowed to learn all twelve kinds of Dao techniques before she would stop.

However, every century, her complexion would grow worse, and eventually, she became the most irritable person in White Emperor City.

Chai Bofu sat cross-legged, his inner world in chaos. Today, with the Yuan Ying and Golden Core disappearing and shattering one after another, there was no need to discuss the damage to the foundations of the Dao; he needed to survive first before worrying about anything else.

Gu Can squatted beside Chai Bofu and asked, “I’m curious, why didn’t you pretend to be Xu Hun? Don’t you have any thoughts of framing him? How does one become a wild cultivator? What’s the hidden story here?”

Gu Can pressed down on Chai Bofu’s head. “You practice water techniques, and I happen to have the River Crossing secret text. If I take this opportunity to intercept your life-bound essence and water fortune, and refine your Golden Core fragments, it would be a perfect boon for my cultivation. Now, speak! What shady connections do you have with Clear Wind City or the Fox Kingdom that made you attempt murder and treasure theft so brazenly?”

The youthful Chai Bofu’s face turned pale as he recalled his once white hair, which, although aged, had been shining with vitality, a sign of life. Now, most of his hair showed signs of withering. With just Gu Can pressing down on his head, strands of hair fell away, turning to ashes before they even touched the ground.

Gu Can increased the force he was applying, using one of the foundational techniques of the River Crossing secret text to begin forcefully extracting Chai Bofu’s water fortune. Chai Bofu's inner world, already in disarray, was like a flood pouring in; Gu Can’s methods were like drilling a large hole in a collapsing dam, taking only the water fortune while letting the flood rush in, collecting it in his own pocket. As for whether that flood would burst through all the defenses, ruining Chai Bofu’s path of cultivation and whether he would have any chance to return to the Golden Core or Yuan Ying realms, Gu Can didn’t care in the slightest.

Chai Bofu immediately began to spill the beans. “I was once a fellow disciple of Xu Hun’s wife, back when we were both in the same sect! So, I wanted to deal a heavy blow to Xu Hun, the lord of the city, while not wanting to put Clear Wind City in danger, leaving Xu Hun without a chance to plead his case. If that young girl suffers here, Xu Hun, as the lord of the city, would be at fault for not offering protection and would bear the brunt of the blame. However, if I were to impersonate Xu Hun and steal treasures, then intentionally leave behind either the young girl or half of Wei Benyuan’s life, it would ruin the great prospects of the Xu family’s heir in Clear Wind City. I didn’t wish for my senior sister’s efforts to go to waste…”

When mentioning that senior sister, Chai Bofu’s emotions became complex, his expression reflecting a deep sense of regret.

Liu Chicheng chuckled. “Love-struck, indeed! I like it; no wonder I hit it off with Brother Longbo at first sight, not wanting to kill you.”

Gu Can pondered for a moment, then asked with a smile, “What about Xu Hun’s son?”

Chai Bofu snapped, “Xu Hun isn’t an idiot; why would he help me raise a son? My relationship with my senior sister is entirely innocent. Don’t you dare slander me!”

Only then did Gu Can withdraw his hand, saying, “What a shame.”

Gu Can suddenly extended his hand again, continuing to intercept water fortune and extract Golden Core fragments, and asked, “Do you not consider Xu Hun an idiot but think of me as a fool? Tell me, is your senior sister at a higher realm than you, or does she hold some leverage over you? Otherwise, with your genuine feelings, it doesn’t add up. Wild cultivators have their reasons for breaking the mold; since that child isn’t your son, your justification is lacking. Love between men and women? If you truly care, with Clear Wind City facing disaster, as it collapses, if Xu Hun were to seize your senior sister, would you not steal his wife and child? Could you really not do that?”

Chai Bofu opened his eyes, seemingly trying to see the young man’s face more clearly, smiling bitterly. “Although I’m a wild cultivator, I’ve never thought of myself as a naturally born wild cultivator. Gu Can, you’re quite the character!”

Chai Bofu paused for a moment. “My senior sister has always been deeply calculating. After we joined forces to kill our master, before she married into the Xu family of Clear Wind City, I only knew she had another sect’s inheritance, which was extremely obscure. I always feared her and never dared to provoke her.”

Gu Can turned to look at Liu Chicheng and smiled. “I have a low realm; it doesn’t matter if I’m seen as a fool. What about you? Do you still think this Brother Longbo is love-struck?”

Liu Chicheng chuckled. “It’s fine; I’m just a fool.”

Only then did Gu Can withdraw his hand and stand up, gazing toward Clear Wind City, which held great potential to become a major sect.

Chai Bofu felt his heart turn to ash. After being toyed with by Gu Can, he was now struggling even to maintain his current state in the Dragon Gate realm.

Gu Can said, “Let’s not go to Clear Wind City. We’ll head straight back to the small town.”

Liu Chicheng laughed. “As you wish.”

Gu Can added, “When we get to my hometown, I suggest you tread carefully.”

Liu Chicheng’s expression darkened.

Back then, Chen Ping’an, Qi Jingchun, and today, Li Baoping and Li Xisheng. 

Along with the person beside him, who was so eager to conceal his murderous thoughts, Gu Can was said to have teamed up with Ma Ku Xuan of Zhenwu Mountain and the young feudal lord Song Mu of Dali…

They all hailed from that small place.

Liu Chicheng immediately changed his mind, saying, “Let’s head north first. Brother Longbo and I will wait for you at the border of Lijuzhou. We won’t accompany you to the small town.”

Gu Can chuckled. “As long as you keep it low-key, there’s really no need to be so cautious.”

Liu Chicheng spoke heavily, “What if? Why bother?”

Gu Can asked, “What if Li Baoping were to go to the Fox Kingdom?”

Liu Chicheng laughed. “That girl is not as simple as you think. Just based on her own abilities, in the small Fox Kingdom, who dares to stretch out a hand? They would lose their tails.”

Gu Can’s expression turned gloomy. “Liu Chicheng, although I’m unclear about why you changed your mind earlier, don’t forget this trip is homecoming for me. Don’t let me walk to the Li family ancestral home on Fulu Street.”

Liu Chicheng smiled. “Oh you, your habit of refusing to acknowledge faces is terrifying.”

As soon as this topic came up, Liu Chicheng looked down at Chai Bofu, who was still sitting on the ground, and raised a foot to step on the “youth’s” Yuan Ying head, applying a little more pressure, pressing him into the ground, leaving just half his head exposed. Chai Bofu dared not move. Liu Chicheng crouched down, his large pink robe sleeves spreading out on the ground like an exceptionally vibrant peony opening up. Liu Chicheng impatiently said, “I’ll give you a stick of incense at most. If you still can’t stabilize your little Dragon Gate realm by then, I won’t protect you.”

Gu Can suddenly asked, “Have you been to the Suspended Mountain?”

Liu Chicheng didn’t lift his head and spoke without reservation, “Unless accompanied by my senior brother, I wouldn’t dare to go there at all.”

It wasn’t just a matter of cultivation level; the key was Liu Chicheng’s identity and roots, which made it unwise for him to approach the Sword Qi Great Wall.

Gu Can asked, “What about Liu Chicheng?”

Liu Chicheng replied, “Once we reach White Emperor City, I will return this skin suit to him. If luck is on his side, he might have the chance to become your fellow disciple.”

Over at the thatched cottage, Li Baoping and Wei Benyuan were also setting off toward the Fox Kingdom, which was allied with Clear Wind City.

Wei Benyuan naturally felt that his alchemical place was too dangerous; going to the Xu family of Clear Wind City would at least provide the girl with an extra talisman for protection.

Wei Benyuan summoned a symbol boat, elegant and refined. As he rode the wind, flowers of jade-green lotus appeared around the boat, suddenly sprouting and standing tall, then slowly dissipating, creating the illusion of a small boat parting a waterway through a lotus pond.

When Li Baoping boarded the small boat, taking advantage of Wei grandfather boarding first, with his back to her, she leaped onto the boat.

This long-lost playful move showed that her mood was quite good.

Seeing her older brother and ensuring the safety of Wei grandfather’s place of cultivation, she would also have the chance to meet her little master uncle again.

Once Wei Benyuan settled at one end of the small boat, Li Baoping stood ready, not sitting down. The scenic view was too beautiful to pass up; riding a horse while traveling gives a different perspective from being airborne.

Wei Benyuan chatted with Li Baoping about some hearsay, but the truth of the matter was likely unknown even to the Xu family’s younger generation.

That Fox Kingdom, home to tens of thousands of fox spirits, had a seven-tailed fox that had long hidden away. Seven hundred years ago, it split into three factions—one hoped to integrate with Clear Wind City and Baoping Continent, one sought a secluded little world, and the most extreme faction even wanted to completely sever ties with the Xu family of Clear Wind City. Eventually, under the leadership of the current patriarch Xu Hun, it transformed into a standoff situation. The third faction was hunted down, killed, and imprisoned, thus clearing the way for the continuous supply of foxskin talismans from Clear Wind City.

Moreover, after a woman took charge of affairs, she skillfully opened sources and generated wealth, steadily increasing the overall number of fox spirits. She had signed several secret contracts with Clear Wind City, one of which was a half-public secret: the Xu family had always leaned toward the Fox Kingdom for cultivation materials, but every fox spirit that failed to break through had to maintain its fox skin intact as repayment to Clear Wind City. Additionally, Clear Wind City had built many residences within the Fox Kingdom for tourists to enjoy, so that wandering sect disciples, pure martial artists, and cultured scholars wouldn’t need to spend their own money, all for the sake of winning the hearts of the fox spirits.

The Fox Kingdom had been meticulously crafted by the Xu family into a picturesque tourist destination, with calligraphy masters’ inscriptions on cliffs, poems from literati inscribed on walls, and the ancient residences of learned immortals, countless in number.

Wei Benyuan smiled. “The Xu family has a great knack for making money, but their reputation isn’t too good.”

Li Baoping had previously purchased some novels about scholarly fox immortals in Clear Wind City, beautifully printed, nearly rivaling the volumes of secular dynasties. However, she didn’t intend to read them and planned to gift them to Pei Qian later. As for the tales of the Jianghu and mountain spirits, Li Baoping had little longing for them now, far less than Pei Qian and Li Huai.

In these years, aside from studying at the academy, Li Baoping hadn’t been idle. She had inquired about some cultivation matters with Lin Shouyi and Xie Xie, and discussed some boxing techniques with Yu Lu. 

These three naturally shared everything they knew with Li Baoping.

Occasionally, when she ran into Li Huai on the road, it was just casual chatting.

The Fox Kingdom was located in a fragmented cave paradise, with vague historical records and a lot of hearsay that couldn’t be taken seriously.

Upon arriving at an entrance, Wei Benyuan disembarked the symbol boat at a wooden pavilion with a plaque reading “Branches of the Same Tree.” The couplets on either side had mostly faded, but the lower couplet was intact: “In this world, there are many passionate seeds.” The upper couplet’s ending read “Gentle Town,” which also had a backstory, said to have been cut down by a passing immortal with a sword. Some said it was Li Tuanjing of Thunder Garden, while others attributed it to Wei Jin of the Snow Temple. As for the accuracy of the dates, it was all for fun; who would bother to verify?

At the pavilion, many people milled about, mostly men, with scholars notably numerous, as the Fox Kingdom had one temple and one mountain that were said to be filled with literary inspiration. Pilgrims visiting to pray and burn incense found great success, hoping to achieve well in examinations. As for some penniless scholars purposely taking detours to the examination, hoping to earn some travel expenses, there were those too. The beauties of the Fox Kingdom were famously fond of scholars, and many downtrodden scholars willingly lived and died in this gentle town, often enjoying long lives. The fox spirits’ infatuation was no mere rumor; whenever the beloved man passed away, they sought not to be born in the same year and month but to die together.

To travel through the Fox Kingdom, there were interesting rules; one had to offer poetry or prose for passage. Poems, songs, essays, and even examination papers could suffice. As long as the talent was high, even a couplet would do. But if one wrote something that the discerning fox spirits found unsightly, then they would have to turn back. As for whether someone else wrote it on their behalf, it didn’t matter.

If one couldn’t produce decent writing, they would have to spend their heavenly money.

Li Baoping glanced at the magnificent building not far from the pavilion and frowned. Were the Xu family of Clear Wind City and the Fox Kingdom accumulating literary fortune through this? Accumulating little by little, what were they trying to accomplish? 

What could they actually do?

The Xu family of Clear Wind City had lowered their stature, marrying the legitimate daughter to a commoner, just to ally with the great Wei family of Dali. Was it that the Xu family had some ulterior motives regarding the future of the Dali court? Did they wish to position a capable Xu family descendant, one who could bear the literary fortune, to secure a place, step by step rising to the status of a minister, ultimately influencing some part of the Dali court and becoming the next great family?

Li Baoping began to recall the small-town journey with the Xu family mother and son. No, she had to ask her grandfather. Aside from that ugly armor, had the Xu family mother and son used any tricks to hide their true schemes back then?

There was one thing her little master uncle had always been indifferent to, but Li Baoping had always felt a small knot in her heart.

That was regarding the Mountain-Relocating Monkey and that little girl, who had borrowed shelter at the Li family in Fulu Street back in the small town.

If that were the only case, it would be fine. What she feared were the schemes and deceptions of those mountain people, twisting and turning for thousands of miles.

The Zhu River’s Zhu Lu father and daughter, her second brother Li Baozhen—two matters already. No more than three.

Wei Benyuan took out two pieces of snowflake money and led Li Baoping into the Fox Kingdom.

At the building, a woman lounged lazily over a writing desk, suddenly lifting her head, her spirit soaring as she immediately sent a flying sword message to the Xu family’s sword chamber in Clear Wind City.

Soon, a flying sword returned, providing a rough dossier. The wording at the end of the secret letter was not subtle, warning her not to have any unrealistic thoughts. The disciple of the Cliff of Immortals was also the direct granddaughter of the Li family’s Yuan Ying. She shouldn’t provoke her, as Clear Wind City was already a candidate for the sect and must avoid unnecessary complications. This made the woman unhappy, and with her long-fingered hand adorned with exquisite rings, she tore the confidential letter into shreds. Although unwilling in her heart, she still didn’t dare to defy the decision of Clear Wind City and could only lazily return to the desk.

That peach bud was cultivating near a waterfall in the Fox Kingdom. What Wei Benyuan referred to as opportunity was when the peach bud unintentionally passed by the waterfall, and unexpectedly, a ribbon of rainbow light floated on the water’s surface. Soon, a Golden Core fox spirit rushed over, eager to seize the opportunity, only to be struck by that ribbon, leaving it wounded and nearly pulled into the deep pool. Once that panicked fox spirit escaped, the ribbon floated back to the surface, gently nudging ashore, as if it had chosen its master, becoming this Wei family maid's colorful waist ribbon. Moreover, under its guidance, the peach bud picked up an inconspicuous dry peach branch in a deep mountain, which, after refining, became a hidden treasure.

Overnight, the peach bud became the luckiest individual in the Fox Kingdom in hundreds of years.

Within the Fox Kingdom, flying with the wind or taking a ferry was forbidden; one could only walk. Fortunately, there were three entrances to the Fox Kingdom. Wei Benyuan chose the one closest to the peach bud, hiring a horse carriage and renting a steed for the girl. One drove the carriage, while the other rode, all the while enjoying the scenery, making the journey far from dull.

Upon reaching the waterfall at the halfway point, the now lively peach bud felt a bit self-conscious when she saw Li Baoping.

After the three of them had tea, Li Baoping finished reminiscing and prepared to take her leave, saying she would head north to the capital of Dali to visit a friend. As for the horse left by the stream at the bottom of the mountain, it would rest now, having accompanied her over mountains and rivers.

Wei Benyuan was both amused and exasperated, while the peach bud was caught off guard.

Wei Benyuan asked, “Are you switching to the horse at the foot of the mountain?”

Li Baoping slapped her forehead, laughing, “I forgot to tell Wei grandfather; I’m now a Qi Refinement cultivator. My realm isn’t high, but I can ride the wind!”

Li Baoping added, “I can also ride a sword, though I prefer not to in general; the wind is strong up there, and it makes my cheeks hurt when I talk.”

The old man and peach bud exchanged glances.

Li Baoping thought for a moment and didn’t wish to hide, “I have some paper, and the words on them are dear to me; they can barely be turned into a symbol boat. But Mr. Mao hopes I don’t take it out easily.”

Wei Benyuan asked helplessly, “Is that all?”

Li Baoping shook her head. “Nothing more. I’ve just learned some boxing techniques from friends. I’m not a pure martial artist, so I can’t rely solely on my physique to travel far.”

Wei Benyuan rose. “Then let the peach bud escort you out of the Fox Kingdom. Otherwise, Wei grandfather will truly be uneasy.”

Though the peach bud’s cultivation might not surpass that of the elder at the moment, her two life-bound items were too mysterious, defensively and offensively balanced, and could already be regarded as the cultivation level of a Golden Core cultivator.

Li Baoping smiled. “Forget it, I won’t hold back Sister Peach Bud’s cultivation.”

She winked at Sister Peach Bud.

Peach Bud understood and blushed slightly, puzzled about how Little Baoping could tell she had someone she liked.

If she didn’t have someone she liked, why would a solitary woman, living in seclusion, apply rouge?

As for the elder, while he would be extremely concerned about Peach Bud’s cultivation, he wouldn’t care about such details.

Li Baoping said her goodbyes and left.

From south to north, she crossed mountains and rivers, passing through the Fox Kingdom, when suddenly a heavy snow began to fall. A young woman in a red cotton coat stood beside a cliffside path, breathing out mist.

The woman’s narrow blade and sword-raising gourd suited the heavy snow.

At that moment, it seemed the world was filled with only two colors: the pure white of the snow and the woman’s exquisite beauty.

In the Lotus Root Blessed Land of Nanyuan Kingdom’s capital, a young girl stood up, heading to the courtyard, striking a fist stance, then telling the little girl perched on the railing with her chin resting on her hands, “Little Rice Grain, I’m about to throw a punch. You go wander around in Scholar’s Alley and buy some sunflower seeds while you’re at it.”

The girl in black hesitated, “I’ll just take a look and won’t say a word; I still have some sunflower seeds in my pocket.”

In truth, it was her duty; as the right protector of the Fallen Mountain, she also served as the deputy leader of the branch. In such times, how could she not help Pei Qian guard the formation?

The young girl glared. “Once I throw this punch, I won’t hold back; is that okay?! Martial fortune doesn’t have eyes; it’ll flock around like rain falling from the sky. How big of a bowl of pickled fish will I eat tonight?”

Zhou Mili hurriedly jumped down from the railing, took a small shoulder pole and walking stick, and ran far away, suddenly stopping and turning her head to ask, “How many pounds of sunflower seeds should I buy?! I heard Sister Nuan Tree say that buying more is cheaper, while buying less won’t get a discount.”

Pei Qian replied helplessly, “Whatever you want.”

Zhou Mili frowned, lifting her small shoulder pole high in the air. “Then I’ll carry a sack on one end of the shoulder pole?”

The little girl felt she was being exceptionally clever.

Pei Qian nodded, though in reality, she was already speechless.

Zhou Mili glanced at Pei Qian, knowing the weight of the situation, then lightly stepped off and leaped over the courtyard wall.

After Little Rice Grain left, Pei Qian stepped out, stomping heavily, causing the entire Nanyuan Kingdom’s capital to tremble. Such an occurrence could not possibly be caused by a mere fifth realm martial artist; it was more due to the influence of her fist intent, causing the mountains and rivers to resonate, even the dragon vein of Nanyuan Kingdom was not spared.

Pei Qian twisted her arms into a strange posture, pausing briefly before lightly thrusting out her fist in a drumming motion.

Moments later, Pei Qian’s entire being seemed to move with her punch, pulled by the intent of her fist, as if her fist was propelled by her heart, aiming to deliver the final blow at the highest point. The girl’s figure soared, stepping into the air, then rushing toward the heavens, her speed like lightning. Ultimately, she arrived at the heavens above the Lotus Root Blessed Land, where the sun hung high, and Pei Qian finally delivered her final punch.

After that punch, beneath her feet lay a vast golden sea of clouds illuminated by the great sun, exploding into a scattering of brilliance.

Almost all the Qi Refiners who had embarked on the path of cultivation and had initially reached the middle five realms in the Lotus Root Blessed Land instinctively looked up at a certain spot in the sky.

Even the spirits and phantoms born from this new blessed land gazed up in confusion at the heavens.

At the same time, the Great Li Martial Temple, the Baoping Continent’s Martial Temple, and several other great martial temples across the other eight continents sensed the change.

Eight streams of martial fortunes surged toward Baoping Continent, ultimately converging with the martial fortune of Baoping Continent, crashing into the Tongye Umbrella held by the Mountain Lord Wei Ban.

In all the major martial temples of Dali, especially the one closest to the Fallen Mountain, the divine beings actively manifested, bowing and clasping their fists toward the Fallen Mountain.

Wei Ban, in his snow-white robe, struggled to maintain his stance, his feet rooted to the ground as he directly activated the power of the mountains and rivers, connecting himself with the entire Piyun Mountain. He had initially intended to help conceal his aura, but at this moment, he didn’t have the luxury to hide; merely standing firm while holding the Tongye Umbrella was already a strain on him. This great mountain lord of an entire continent had previously been perplexed by Zhu Lian’s insistence on holding the Tongye of the Tongye Continent, now both angry and amused, he exclaimed, “Zhu Lian! I’ll f*** your grandpa!”

Regardless of how many night tours he hosted, in terms of reputation, the Mountain Lord was simply exceptional; countless female deities, spirits, and fairies fell for him at first sight.

As for the old steward of the Fallen Mountain, it was best to forget about him; no one could remember his appearance well, at most only recalling his identity.

Zhu Lian stood at the cliff of a bamboo building, hands clasped behind his back, as the martial fortunes surged through the heavens and earth, rushing towards the Fallen Mountain. Despite the protective fist intent surrounding him, his long robe was still shredded by the dense and countless flying martial fortunes. Over time, the mask that had covered Zhu Lian’s face for many years also began to peel away, revealing his true visage.

Zhu Lian extended two fingers, pinching a strand of hair at his temple, squinting and smiling.

The young Zhu Lian, with such features, could captivate the hearts of beauties.

*(End of Chapter)*

 ### Chapter 770: No One at the Top

Pei Qian opened the courtyard door to find Zhou Mili standing there, a hiking staff in hand and a small shoulder pole balanced on her shoulder. One end of the pole carried a sack full of melon seeds. The little girl in black was chatting away with the stone lion at the entrance—a lively chatter from her, and a stoic silence from the lion, a perfect match.

Upon hearing the creaking door, Zhou Mili quickly turned to Pei Qian, about to ask something. However, Pei Qian gestured for her to stay quiet and then turned her gaze towards a distant rooftop.

There, a middle-aged martial arts master stood proudly atop a grand building with a sloping roof. Now that he had been discovered, he intended to leave and report back to the palace about the situation. In truth, he knew little; the young emperor was merely wary of the girl who had punched her way through the clouds, hastily ordering him to investigate. He had arrived too late; he saw the girl return to the earth, as swift and silent as an arrow, contrasting sharply with the earlier tremors that had shaken the capital. It was a silence that sent a chill through the master, a display of peak mastery, truly a transformation.

After the demise of the dark lord Ding Ying, Yu Zhenyi, who had turned to cultivating immortality, had vanished without a trace, rumored to have ascended to the heavens. Others like Chun Chao Palace’s Zhou Fei and the National Teacher Zhong Qiu had also gone on distant journeys. Top masters like the newly emerged Lu Tai, who had unified the demonic sects and was set to duel Yu Zhenyi, had faded into obscurity. Since then, there had been no top-tier martial artist appearing in the world of Jianghu for many years.

Was this “girl” not a legendary figure, a transcendent being with the ability to maintain her youth?

Was she an immortal who had descended from the heavens to roam this realm?

As the atmosphere of the Jianghu grew thin, the aura of the mountains thickened, filled with the strange and the bizarre.

Unexpectedly, the girl took just a few steps, leapt over the wall, and zipped across the rooftop, arriving effortlessly at the opposite roof facing the middle-aged master. They faced off, with Pei Qian standing slightly lower. The girl withdrew her fists, clasped her hands in greeting, and spoke in the refined dialect of the South Garden Kingdom: “I am Pei Qian, a disciple of the Falling Star Mountain. May I know what guidance you seek?”

The middle-aged martial artist, with a knife hung at his waist, reined in his awkwardness and returned the greeting. “I am Dong Zhongxia. I am currently a servant of the Wei family, the instructor for the Imperial Forest Army’s martial arts.”

Dong Zhongxia smiled and said, “No need for guidance; I am merely here on a patrol mission. Since it is indeed Miss Pei cultivating here, I can return to report without concern.”

The emperor had issued a secret decree that wherever a disciple of Falling Star Mountain was encountered, they must be respected.

The former emperor, Wei Liang, had unexpectedly abdicated in favor of his eldest son. After the new emperor, Wei Yan, took the throne, he initiated the imperial examinations, granting amnesty to various commoners and allowing their offspring to participate. He also established military examinations, permitting sons of soldiers and Jianghu disciples with three generations of clear lineage to compete. The edict specifically stated that these military examinations aimed to promote trusted individuals for national service. Additionally, shrines and temples were being constructed, with the Ministry of Rites tasked to sift through local records to commemorate loyal officials, hoping to honor their spirits for continued protection of the land. Furthermore, the Wei family began secretly supporting and courting practitioners of the Dao to help suppress the emerging demons and spirits, preventing them from causing harm, as the martial artists of various Jianghu sects, despite their prowess, were often at a loss against these unfamiliar entities.

However, Dong Zhongxia was among the newly emerging elite masters of Jianghu. At an age of enlightenment, he had recently broken through his martial arts bottleneck. After traveling abroad, he had suppressed several notorious demons, gaining fame, and was chosen by the new emperor to serve as one of the martial advisors of the South Garden Kingdom. Yet, he now realized that the emperor was the true master of martial arts, with profound cultivation.

Pei Qian smiled and asked, “So, Dong senior, are you not a native of the South Garden Kingdom?”

Otherwise, he would have recognized the peak fist style she had deliberately displayed, which originated from the former national master, Zhong Fuzi.

However, this indicated that Dong Zhongxia might not truly be the emperor's trusted confidant.

Dong Zhongxia nodded. “I hail from the Pine Whisper Kingdom and have only just arrived in the South Garden Kingdom.”

Pei Qian turned her gaze elsewhere, frowning slightly. Was there something he was hiding? Earlier, her punch had caused quite a stir, attracting the attention of a high-ranking figure from the South Garden Kingdom, fulfilling his duty as a court official. She treated him with respect, but the person accompanying Dong Zhongxia, upon seeing her emerge, mistakenly thought she hadn’t noticed and not only failed to withdraw but also audaciously employed a technique to eavesdrop, manifesting tiny droplets of water around Pei Qian and Dong Zhongxia to listen in.

Pei Qian bid farewell to Dong Zhongxia.

Dong Zhongxia was slightly surprised, realizing she truly wasn’t an immortal from a greater realm.

Pei Qian’s surroundings were still and silent, yet the dust on the roof suddenly scattered, and in the blink of an eye, Dong Zhongxia found himself unable to see Pei Qian’s figure.

Pei Qian had already crouched next to the eaves of a distant rooftop, staring at a young man who sat cross-legged, hands forming a seal, wearing a robe that was still scarce in the Lotus Root Blessed Land, topped with a jade crown, and a white jade short sword tucked at his waist.

The young man stood up with a smile. “I am Wang Guangjing, a guest from the Prince’s Mansion. I have the pleasure of meeting Miss Pei.”

Pei Qian inquired, “Are you not the Master Wang from the Prince’s Mansion? Weren’t you and the other two enlightened beings ordered to leave the capital and reopen the Longtan Water Cave?”

Currently, the capital of the South Garden Kingdom was a mix of dragons and fish, with many self-proclaimed masters, but true practitioners of the Dao were rare. Most were either quickly establishing their sects in beautiful locations or were aligning themselves with the monarchs of the three kingdoms to take advantage of their resources, which were as new as they were valuable. Falling Star Mountain had meticulously documented these events, and Nuan Shu would regularly transcribe them and send them to the ancestral hall of Jisefeng for archiving, with the original manuscripts stored with the old chef. Falling Star Mountain had secretly established two channels for collecting information in the Lotus Root Blessed Land: one personally crafted by Zhong Fuzi, well-known to both the old emperor Wei Liang and the new emperor Wei Yan, being one of the clauses of their contract with Falling Star Mountain; the other, run by Zhu Lian, deep within the Pine Whisper Kingdom.

Pei Qian did not fully understand these court affairs but was aware of the underlying tensions between the old and new emperors. Otherwise, the old emperor would not have been so close to his second son Wei Yun, nor would the new emperor Wei Yan have allowed his younger brother Wei Yun to hold the position of governor of the capital, especially not appointing a senior official who had favored the younger prince to serve as the national treasurer. If it had not been for the young emperor’s trusted aide, the Minister of Rites, who would later oversee the mountain and water deities, Pei Qian would have thought the old emperor was still in control.

Wang Guangjing, slightly taken aback, with an apologetic expression, said, “Before leaving, I was in a hurry to break through and made a significant error in my cultivation, necessitating a period of recovery in the capital.”

As Dong Zhongxia departed, he glanced back, a heavy heart.

That Prince Wei Yun was certainly not to be underestimated, especially with the retired emperor's backing, having gathered a considerable number of practitioners.

If Pei Qian, a martial artist, became entangled with the Prince’s Mansion, would that not incite further turmoil in the capital of the South Garden Kingdom?

Dong Zhongxia hurriedly returned to a hidden residence near the palace, once a place of cultivation for the National Teacher Zhong Qiu. There, he encountered a man in plain clothes who was secretly visiting, and his heart skipped a beat. He quickly lowered his stance and clasped his hands, softly saying, “Your Majesty.”

Emperor Wei Yan listened attentively to Dong Zhongxia’s words, smiling. “A mere snake and rat dares to speak of attracting attention in front of a dragon?”

How could a small pond in Prince Wei Yun’s residence possibly provide for a dragon accustomed to rivers? And what kind of hospitality could be expected?

Beside Wei Yan stood a graceful and charming woman, his sister Wei Zhen.

Wei Zhen softly asked, “Since that girl is from Falling Star Mountain, what is her connection to that Chen Jianxian? Brother, why not ask her?”

Wei Yan cautioned, “Such matters of state are not to be trifled with.”

Wei Zhen felt somewhat disappointed.

Now half a practitioner herself, she was deeply interested in the realm of Falling Star Mountain. Over the years, her explorations of the palace’s secret archives had only fueled her admiration.

On Pei Qian’s side, after listening to Wang Guangjing’s convoluted words, she maintained her usual expression but found it rather amusing.

Though she had previously suppressed her mind and body to appear younger, a mere girl from a small town, if one spoke of the human heart, even at the time she had just left the Lotus Root Blessed Land, Pei Qian was not a naïve child. Otherwise, those two seasoned constables from a small border town of the Daqing Dynasty would not have been so easily fooled by her fabrications, escorting her back to the inn of the Ninth Lady with respect. Even Li Huai and two other academy friends still regarded her as the “princess who fell into hardship.”

Pei Qian declined Wang Guangjing’s invitation, intending to return to the house and meet Zhou Mili.

Unexpectedly, Wang Guangjing remained persistent, bringing up Prince Wei Yun, claiming the prince greatly valued virtuous individuals, especially martial artists. Even if Pei Qian was unwilling to stroll over to the prince’s mansion, the prince could come to visit personally. If Pei Qian only nodded, the prince would surely find time to come.

Pei Qian felt a headache coming on. His words were full of empty threats or overly formal phrases. What kind of foolish guest was this Wang Guangjing? Was he helping the prince recruit people or drive them away?

Pei Qian then thought, despite Wang Guangjing’s falsehoods, his closed-door retreat was not an error; he had successfully advanced to the cave dwelling stage, making him one of the early fifth-stage Qi cultivators of the Lotus Root Blessed Land. In fact, he could be considered half an immortal. In this blessed land, the spiritual energy was growing denser, and more people were climbing the mountains to cultivate, yet those who could reach the fifth stage were still few and far between, each precious. The key was to progress quickly; the most gifted Qi cultivators would soon face the bottleneck of the Lotus Root Blessed Land.

Regarding when the Lotus Root Blessed Land could ascend to a higher tier, the old chef had once remarked that even if they could muster the funds for the “Grain Rain,” they should not rush, especially since Falling Star Mountain truly did not have that money.

At that moment, in the courtyard, all eyes were on Wei Bo, the Mountain Lord. 

Zheng Dafeng joked, “Slowly speak, but earn money quickly.”

Wei Bo smiled, “If you keep this up, I’ll flip the board.”

Suddenly, Pei Qian recalled the old chef’s reminder before departing: Do not imitate your master in every way; you have your own Jianghu to traverse. If you resemble your master too closely, he will always worry about you, seeing you as a child needing his support.

Pei Qian raised an eyebrow, feeling it made sense. Glancing at Wang Guangjing, she transformed her demeanor, no longer holding back as she had with Dong Zhongxia, and stated directly, “Stop trying to tug at Falling Star Mountain’s strings. I won’t meddle in the Wei family’s affairs. As for you, guest of the prince’s mansion, leave quickly and focus on your own cultivation. Remember my words: if others speak sweetly, listen well. Should you harbor ulterior motives and attempt to test me with tricks…”

Pei Qian raised her fist, lightly shaking it. “If I throw this punch, you may not catch it.”

Wang Guangjing feigned helplessness, “I’ve heard that Chen Jianxian is most reasonable. Miss Pei, as someone from my hometown and half an immortal…”

“My master said that using lofty ideals to harm good people is not much different from bullying with power.”

With a sudden push off the ground, Pei Qian appeared in front of Wang Guangjing in an instant. He barely had time to react before the girl’s fist was almost touching his forehead, barely an inch away.

“Still not leaving? Do you enjoy being carried away while lying down?”

Wang Guangjing’s white jade short sword, which resembled a paperweight, glimmered ominously.

Pei Qian didn’t even glance at it. “Do you know how many sword cultivators and sword immortals I’ve encountered?!”

Wang Guangjing stepped back, smiling. “Since Miss Pei does not wish to accept the prince’s good intentions, then let it be. The mountains are high and the waters are deep; we are all cultivators, and perhaps there will be opportunities to become friends in the future.”

Pei Qian retracted her fist, glancing at Wang Guangjing’s heart’s landscape, her demeanor shifting. She spoke in a deep tone, “Elder Cui once said, if a martial artist strikes, they should shatter the villain's malice and diminish their courage; one must strike decisively.”

Wang Guangjing chuckled wryly. “Why must Miss Pei be so aggressive? Do you want me to kneel and apologize? Have I shown any disrespect from beginning to end?”

Pei Qian felt conflicted, concerned that she might have misread the situation. She had misjudged the weight of her punch and acted rashly. 

Her embarrassment mirrored the awkwardness she felt before the Temple of the Water God of the Jade Liquid River.

Instead, she thought, it would have been more straightforward had Chen Lingjun handled it.

Suddenly, Pei Qian looked up.

A figure in a gray long robe arrived on the wind, floating down and pressing Wang Guangjing’s head, twisting his wrist and sending him spinning into the street.

Zhu Lian turned his back to the street, raised a hand, and casually waved, sending the unsteady Wang Guangjing flying ten feet down the street, his eyes rolling back as he fainted on the spot.

Zhu Lian chuckled, “There’s no such thing as being too cautious; you never know when a rat might spoil the pot.”

Zhu Lian leaned slightly back, glancing elsewhere. He noticed hidden practitioners lurking, preparing to rescue Wang Guangjing, and asked, “Does everyone from the Prince’s Mansion enjoy bringing home rat droppings?”

That Prince Wei Yun had been too restless for quite some time.

As for the retired emperor Wei Liang, his royal disposition remained unchanged. Even if he was keen on the Dao, he had never truly seen the grandeur of the world. Now a retired emperor, having shed his dragon robe, he had yet to fully achieve enlightenment and was up to his usual tricks. Of course, he might also have thoughts about bargaining with Falling Star Mountain.

If the current emperor Wei Yan hadn’t been reasonably benevolent, the Lotus Root Blessed Land would soon be in turmoil, and the ones suffering the most would be Fuzi Zhong Qiu and Cao Qinglang.

Pei Qian focused, puzzled. “Old chef, why do you suddenly have a different demeanor?”

Zhu Lian sighed. “The mountain winds are strong; it blew away my old face.”

Zhu Lian turned to look at the young immortal sleeping on the street, silently observing.

Pei Qian suddenly asked, “Old chef, is there a lack of freedom in Falling Star Mountain?”

Zhu Lian reflected, “You’ve grown up to ask such questions. I initially thought only the young master would ask me this upon returning home.”

Pei Qian laughed, “I just mentioned it casually; you can tell my master the answer later.”

Zhu Lian replied slowly, “The freedom to strike may not be great. But in life, the freedom of expression, the freedom to cook, the freedom to earn and spend money, the freedom to read and appreciate the scenery, the freedom to play chess with friends without seeking victory, and the freedom to watch younger generations grow day by day—aren’t all of these freedoms?”

Pei Qian found it uncomfortable not to hear the old chef’s familiar voice, so she quickly changed the subject. “What about that pretender Wang Guangjing?”

Zhu Lian said, “Yu Lu and Xie Xie have already taken leave from the academy and will be traveling together in the Lotus Root Blessed Land for the next two years. I’ll borrow someone from Wei Yun, and Wang Guangjing can guide them. With Yu Lu around, cultivating the heart won’t be a problem.”

Pei Qian was curious. “Did Li Huai not join in this excitement?”

Zhu Lian shook his head. “According to Brother Dafeng, if Li Huai were to step in, the practitioners of the Lotus Root Blessed Land wouldn’t have any significant opportunities.”

Pei Qian had an idea but didn’t dare voice it.

Zhu Lian asked, “Were you thinking of going to Lion Peak in Beiju Lu Zhou to find Li Huai’s father?”

Pei Qian nodded. “Although Senior Gu is no longer in the world, Uncle Li’s martial arts are still excellent, and he taught my master. I just want to practice my fists there. Coincidentally, Li Huai also wants to visit his parents and sister.”

Zhu Lian contemplated. “That’s doable.”

Pei Qian sat at the edge of the roof, feeling a bit lost. “But such matters should be approved by my master.”

Zhu Lian crouched nearby, softly comforting her. “If the young master were here, he would surely agree.”

On the street, a little girl carrying two bags of melon seeds approached, and Zhu Lian couldn’t help but chuckle. “Do you plan to eat melon seeds as your main meal?”

Pei Qian leapt forward, landing on the street.

As Zhou Mili made her way over, she carefully skirted around the unconscious Wang Guangjing. She kept her back turned to him, thinking, You don’t see me, I don’t see you; we’re all wandering in Jianghu, keeping our distances. Once past the sleeping man, Zhou Mili quickened her pace, balancing the two small bags, before stopping to steady them. She whispered, “Old chef, I saw Pei Qian chatting with someone from afar. What happened? You attacked sneakily? That’s not polite; next time, at least let me know before you hit someone. It wouldn’t sound good if it got out in Jianghu. I’ll crack some melon seeds to summon him awake, and you can come back?”

Zhu Lian nodded, imitating the little girl’s speech. “Sure, I like this.”

Since Zhu Lian had struck with great care, Wang Guangjing, in fact, had already awakened when Zhou Mili passed by. He was now acutely listening to the girl’s seemingly righteous but entirely unreasonable words, nearly brought to tears as the young immortal, both a guest and a behind-the-scenes strategist in the Prince’s Mansion, almost lost his composure.

Pei Qian pinched Zhou Mili’s cheek, and with a tug, the girl tilted her head and stood on her toes, gently tapping Pei Qian’s fingers, mumbling, “There’s no need for this; really no need.”

Zhu Lian stamped his foot.

Wang Guangjing’s entire body jolted up, no longer daring to pretend to be asleep. He stood, trembling slightly, “I pay my respects to the immortal.”

Zhu Lian nodded, his expression kind, and gave a light pat.

The strike sent Wang Guangjing flying straight to the end of the street.

Zhu Lian laughed, “This punch should make your courage shrink.”

Zhu Lian looked around, muttering to himself, “It’s a pity that when I first met Ding Ying, he was still a child. By the time I returned, he was gone. Otherwise, I could have taught him how to treat his juniors.”

He wasn’t just talking nonsense.

In fact, Ding Ying’s later actions followed Zhu Lian’s old path closely. Zhu Lian had previously single-handedly fought against nine others during the Jiazi agreement, wiping out more than half of the renowned masters on the list. The only reason Zhu Lian hadn’t killed Ding Ying was that he deemed the hope of ascension too slim, feeling that the meaning of ascension seemed trivial at that moment. He purposely gifted Ding Ying a rather appealing head, along with the corresponding martial fortune. It could be said that Ding Ying’s subsequent achievements, both in martial arts and character development, owed much to Zhu Lian.

During Zhu Lian’s time on earth, this world had first rank in literature and second in martial arts.

Pei Qian asked, “Shall we head back?”

Zhu Lian nodded, “Let’s finish a bag of melon seeds first, or Nuan Shu will surely scold you for buying too much.”

Upon returning to the residence, Pei Qian inquired about breaking through the sixth stage bottleneck, as well as how to deal with martial fortune in Beiju Lu Zhou. Zhou Mili reminded her to ask about the seventh and eighth-stage bottlenecks as well.

Pei Qian shot her a glare. “Does being anxious help you eat hot tofu?”

Zhou Mili looked puzzled. Isn’t even the hottest tofu a one-bite affair?

Zhu Lian still shared some precautions with Pei Qian.

Afterward, Zhu Lian quickly returned to Falling Star Mountain.

Pei Qian mentioned she had a few matters to attend to, stopping by Cao Qinglang’s ancestral home to help tidy up with Zhou Mili. Then, they went to Baihe Temple’s night market and indulged in the spicy, numbing delicacies the master had mentioned, ordering two servings of hot pot. After satisfying their appetites, they glanced at the imperial family’s library, which was much shorter than the Zhilian Tower back in Nuan Shu’s hometown.

Later, Pei Qian also visited a peer who had transformed into a young woman some years earlier. She had married a scholar who had successfully passed the imperial examinations and was now on a prosperous career path.

When that woman’s family set out in a carriage to a temple in the capital to offer prayers, Pei Qian followed from a distance, keeping herself hidden.

In the end, Pei Qian helped her master by visiting the Scholar’s Alley, where a once poor scholar had a story with a wandering woman holding a pipa. The lovers had never become a couple.

Asking the local shopkeeper, Pei Qian learned that the scholar had failed his examinations twice and had cried deeply, seemingly giving up entirely, returning home to start a school.

Who knows if that student would ever encounter a charming girl again in his life?

On the last day before leaving the South Garden Kingdom, Pei Qian quietly climbed to the rooftop at night.

Zhou Mili followed suit.

The slender girl and the not-so-small girl lay on the roof, gazing at the round moon.

Zhou Mili cracked some melon seeds and casually asked, “Why is it that the more one practices martial arts, the less one dares to strike?”

Pei Qian replied, “My master treats the lives of others as if they were fragile porcelain. He never explicitly says this, but I’ve always seen it.”

Zhou Mili nodded vigorously, “That’s quite right! So, there’s no need to rush into striking, Pei Qian, let’s not rush.”

Pei Qian smiled, “What do you mean by ‘we’? You’re not even practicing martial arts. Not practicing martial arts is tough enough. Look, my master once said not to start too early with martial arts. The only time I didn’t listen to my master, I faced a major setback. So, you see, you must listen to your master.”

Zhou Mili stealthily moved her hand with the melon seeds farther away, pretending to say something heart-wrenching. When Pei Qian reached for her, she missed, and the little girl burst into laughter, quickly pulling her hand back.

Pei Qian looked up at the sky, chuckling, scratching her head. She had thought that reaching the highest point would allow her to see Elder Cui again.

Zhou Mili whispered, “Pei Qian, when you go to Beiju Lu Zhou, remember to take a look at the Mute Lake for me.”

Pei Qian asked, “Don’t you want to go together?”

Zhou Mili shook her head. “I won’t have any friends there.”

Pei Qian ruffled Zhou Mili’s hair. “You silly head, getting confused over small matters but so clever with major issues.”

Zhou Mili sighed out of nowhere.

Pei Qian asked, “What’s wrong? Got something on your mind?”

Zhou Mili shook her head, her expression serious, “I don’t have any worries, so I’m troubled.”

Pei Qian delivered a light knock on her head.

Zhou Mili pretended to be in pain, rolling around on the rooftop, thoroughly enjoying herself.

Pei Qian lay quietly beside her, gently punching the sky, murmuring, “I guess I need to reach higher.”

Gu Can and Liu Chicheng traveled north with the recently demoted Chai Bofu.

Liu Chicheng indeed halted at the border between the two states.

Gu Can continued alone.

Liu Chicheng and Long Bo strolled leisurely in a bustling city of Chizhou. Liu Chicheng was there to admire the beauties of the mountains below, while the white-haired Chai Bofu was too busy healing from his injuries. He had previously misspoken and received a slap from Liu Chicheng, nearly losing his footing, compounded by the ever-watchful Gu Can, who seemed ready to dig a hole for him. The once formidable Yuanying master, who had wrestled with many prominent figures atop the mountains of Baoping Prefecture, now felt like he had regressed to his bleak days as a fifth-stage practitioner.

When Liu Chicheng and Chai Bofu returned to the immortal’s inn, Liu Chicheng walked with an air of confidence, only to be struck by lightning.

He ordered Chai Bofu to keep his distance.

Chai Bofu, filled with words, immediately went out to stroll by himself, not daring to stay at the inn.

Liu Chicheng directly put away his pink robe, daring only to show his original scholarly appearance, and lightly knocked on the door.

Inside, two people were engaged in a chess match, ignoring him completely.

Liu Chicheng mustered his courage to push open the door, silently approaching a man in white and observing him closely. 

The man in white was playing chess with a solemn-faced scholar in green.

The white-clad man smiled. “Cui Zhan, this move isn’t bad. If Gu Can were to become my disciple, I wouldn’t hold it against you for rescuing a waste of effort. If he becomes my junior apprentice, I’ll agree to your request.”

Cui Zhan nodded. “Then it’s a deal.”

Cui Zhan poised his piece but didn’t place it on the board, so the board remained empty.

Liu Chicheng held his breath.

The man in white, not looking at the board, smiled. “You’ve found a good seedling for Baidi City, and you’ve even brought this person to play chess. How should I thank you? No wonder my master once told me that the reason he chose you as a disciple was due to your knack for stirring up hives, ensuring that I, as your senior brother, wouldn’t be so bored.”

Liu Chicheng felt parched, his expression stiff.

The man in white stood up. “Let’s not play anymore. This game is a mess created by your own choosing; don’t think to drag me down with you. The Great Li Dynasty can’t bear the consequences.”

Cui Zhan sighed, returning the pieces to the box, and stood up. “Then I won’t see you off.”

The man in white nodded and vanished.

Liu Chicheng wiped the sweat off his forehead.

Cui Zhan collected the chessboard and box, glancing at Liu Chicheng with a smile. “Your ability to court death exceeds even mine.”

Liu Chicheng forced a smile. “Who would have thought I’d encounter so many ‘what ifs’ in a row?”

Cui Zhan chuckled. “Not many; just three.”

Liu Chicheng felt utterly helpless.

Cui Zhan casually remarked, “If you die, there’s no need to worry about dying anymore.”

Liu Chicheng bowed. “Congratulations, National Teacher, on breaking through.”

Cui Zhan replied, “Wishing a 99-year-old old-timer longevity is also courting death.”

Liu Chicheng began to play coy. “As long as my senior brother is around, I fear nothing.”

Cui Zhan said, “Letting your senior brother kill you is as simple as one phrase from me.”

Liu Chicheng immediately bowed again, looking pitiful. “I implore the National Teacher to share some scholarly wisdom; that’s what I wish to hear most now.”

Cui Zhan said, “Then heed my advice: when Gu Can arrives in Baidi City, regardless of what happens, just protect him from dying; don’t do anything unnecessary.”

Liu Chicheng wanted to ask this genuine master about heavenly secrets, but Cui Zhan had already vanished.

Liu Chicheng sighed heavily.

In the once-busy area of the old Shanyan Academy in the Great Li capital, it had been sealed off for years, now desolate, overgrown with weeds, with wild rabbits and foxes roaming.

A streak of white light descended from the sky, bright and unashamed, completely ignoring the grand formation of the Great Li capital, as if even the Confucian sage overseeing the heavens was not worth his attention.

After the man in white appeared, he glanced at the restless imitation of the White Jade Capital. There, it seemed they had received a secret decree, and the activated White Jade Capital quickly quieted down.

This man, who actually disliked leaving Baidi City, walked slowly, lamenting, “Spend a grain to remove weeds, but this is just evil grass.”

Before Gu Can returned home, four individuals, two pairs of master and servant, were essentially returning home.

In the mud-bottle alley, the Great Li prince Song Jixin and his maid Zhi Gui.

In the apricot blossom alley, Ma Kuxuan.

As for Ma Kuxuan’s maid, “Shu Dian,” she felt rather superfluous on this journey.

Song Jixin, who was being escorted by Ma Kuxuan under the pretense of protection, found it utterly repulsive.

The ferry docked at Niujiao Mountain.

Ma Kuxuan took Shu Dian to the River God Temple of Longxu River.

Song Jixin and Zhi Gui headed to the mud-bottle alley.

However, Zhi Gui, under the cover of night, left the house alone, glancing at the clean courtyard next door, with spring couplets and blessings, she stepped out of the alley.

After Zhi Gui left the small alley, deep in the night, Song Jixin carried a small stool into the courtyard, merely standing there and not sitting down, gazing towards the neighbor’s yard, which seemed to shrink increasingly.

Zhi Gui first went to the Iron Lock Well, scooped a handful of water, weighed it, and poured it back into the well.

Then she walked out of the town, nearby Li Huai’s house, looking at the small hill named Pearl Mountain, her brows tightly knit.

Buried there was the true dragon’s body, refined and suppressed by the three sects’ sage.

Pearl Mountain.

“Pearl” refers to Wang Zhu. The true pearl is indeed Wang Zhu’s true form.

As for Wang Zhu's current body, it was merely a transformation of the true dragon Li Zhu, not her true form. She still needed someone to “dot the dragon’s eye” to reclaim her true form legitimately.

Only then could she restore her complete true dragon identity, at which point all the grand fortunes of the world’s dragons would coalesce in her alone! Helping her break through the Yuan Ying stage bottleneck would be nothing, and breaking through the Yu Pu stage bottleneck wouldn’t be difficult either. Once she stabilized her immortal state, her combat power could rival half of the ascended beings.

The scribe, the one who helps with the “dotting,” was the mud-legged boy who had signed a contract with her years ago, Chen Ping An, the first person she saw during the harsh winter after leaving the Iron Lock Well.

However, at that time, Chen Ping An’s spirit was too weak, and his fortune was so thin it was appalling; she didn’t want to be dragged down by him, so she chose to recognize the neighboring Great Li prince Song Jixin as her “master.”

The four-legged snake that Song Jixin had tossed into the neighboring yard would run back on its own; why was it so despised yet unwilling to stay at Chen Ping An’s home?

Similarly, as one of the five opportunities of the great Dao, when Chen Ping An gifted that little mud loach to Gu Can, Gu Can not only accepted it but also managed to receive it without any issues.

Logically speaking, after Song Jixin tossed it several times, it should have counted as Chen Ping An’s opportunity.

But how could that little snake with horns on its forehead dare to sit on par with Wang Zhu?! Recognizing Chen Ping An as its master like Wang Zhu?!

Wang Zhu had established a master-servant relationship with the neighboring Song Jixin; however, that was merely a trick of Wang Zhu. Later, it was renamed Zhi Gui by Song Jixin, which was quite meaningful.

The name “Zhi Gui” originally belonged to the overseer Song Yuzhang, but it was actually given by Cui Zhan to Song Yuzhang, then “coincidentally” caught Song Jixin’s eye. He remembered it unknowingly, always resonating within him, leading to an unshakeable recollection, ultimately helping Wang Zhu to be named Zhi Gui.

The two characters “Zhi Gui” are also rooted in the tale of “borrowing light from a wall.”

The plaque hanging in the main hall of the mud-bottle alley reads “Huiyuan Hall,” hand-painted by the late Great Li emperor.

Everything has its significance.

Thus, during those years, Zhi Gui could slowly absorb the dragon energy of the Great Li Dynasty.

As a result, Song Jixin missed the dragon throne, merely becoming a prince and not an emperor; there were reasons for this.

In the grand scheme of things, fate and destiny had their own arrangements.

And when Zhi Gui initially met Lu Chen, who had specifically come to find her, she instinctively mentioned Chen Ping An to deflect disaster, not Song Jixin.

Zhi Gui stood still, gazing at Pearl Mountain, silent for a long time.

Song Jixin approached her.

Zhi Gui conveyed these inner thoughts silently.

Delaying further held little significance; perhaps it could lead to enmity with Song Jixin.

Unexpectedly, Song Jixin smiled. “I don’t mind.”

Wang Zhu blinked. “I don’t mind either.”

Song Jixin was taken aback, his heart aching slightly.

#### The Fifth Realm

The old scholar stood above the sea of clouds, gazing at the magnificent mountains and rivers, exclaiming, “A poor scholar moves house, moving books is like moving mountains; only with books can one be considered wealthy.”

Beside him stood a scholar empty-handed, without a long sword, because in the far distance, a sword light held up the heavens.

The scholar said, “This beautiful land will soon be filled with slaughter.”

The old scholar laughed, “Sages do not harm things; those who do not harm cannot be harmed.”

The scholar shook his head. “There are so few sages like that.”

The old scholar also shook his head. “I see sages everywhere; thus, it’s clear that if you’re skilled in fighting, your vision and realm should be lower.”

The scholar was left speechless. Now, in this world, there were only the two of them, and this boasting was not unfounded; the old scholar was indeed one to seize every opportunity.

This was what the old scholar himself said, not slander from the world.

The old scholar fell silent for a moment, suddenly invigorated. “Since we have nothing to do, let me tell you about my closed-door disciple.”

The scholar inhaled deeply. Here we go again; it wasn’t that he lacked patience, but even the best patience couldn’t withstand the old scholar’s incessant rambling. He turned his head, helplessly saying, “Can we not talk about this?”

The old scholar lamented, “What a regret in life!”

The scholar sighed in relief. 

It was less exhausting to hear the old scholar chatter than to engage in swordplay.

The old scholar suddenly said, “If I don’t speak, will you? That’s a refreshing thought!”
